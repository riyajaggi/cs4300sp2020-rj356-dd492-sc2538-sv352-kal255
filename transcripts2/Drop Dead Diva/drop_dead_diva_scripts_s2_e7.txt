 ♪ JANE: Sea that aspiring modal there? That was ma, Deb, until the day I died. I thought I'd go straight to heaven, but there was a bit of a mix-up and I woke up in someone else's body. So now I'm Jane, a super-busy lawyer with my very own assistant. I got a new life, a new wardrobe. The only people who know what's going on with me are my girlfriend, Stacy, and my guardian angel, Fred. I used to think everything happened for a reason. And, well, I sure hope I was right.

 ♪ JANE: Good morning, Linda. Doughnuts? Randy, I got you a bear claw. Justine, dig in. Thank you. What are you doing? Ingratiating myself with my co-workers by handing out breakfast treats. Oh, I got you a cheese Danish. Although I don't think cheese and pastries are a good mix. Hey. Thanks. Jane. Yes? Your mother is in your office. Oh, Elaine? No, I wasn't clear. Not Jane's mother, Deb's mother. What? Why? I have no idea.

 Now, remember, she belongs in the past, okay? She's no longer Mom. Okay. Here, take the box. My mom is here. No, She's not Mom. She's Bobbi Dobkins. Oh, hey, Larry. That was my cheese Danish. Hello, Bobbi What a nice surprise. I hope you don't mind. I don't have an appointment. Oh, no. You can drop by any time. I'm sorry, sit down. Heh, heh. Uh, is everything okay? With me, yes. Oh, okay. I still miss Deb more than... But I'm fine. I'm... When we met during my divorce, I just felt like we connected. I'm hoping you can help me with a legal matter. Of course. A family friend has been arrested. Really? Who? Well, you wouldn't know her. Oh, I might. You never know. Her name is Samantha Colby. Samantha Colby? She's being charged with stealing from her company, and it's serious. Bobbi, I'm so happy to help you. But why me instead of Grayson? I mean, I know you two are close. I think you're the right person to handle the case. In fact, can we just keep this between us? Absolutely. ♪ Why are you not at your desk? The receptionist calls when you arrive so I make sure your coffee's fresh. Good answer. There's a walk-in. I put... I don't do walk-ins. They're not partnership-worthy. Sorry. He seemed like a nice guy. I'll hike care of it. Hello. Kim Kaswell. Mike Barry. I really need your help. I appreciate you coming in, but... What is that? His name's Sonny. [GIBBERING] Can you excuse me for a second? Fred. I tried to tell you. If this ever happens again... I know. I'm fired. How do you work for that woman? Joke's on her. The client was asking for Jane. I redirected. I've never been more proud of you. I'm sorry, it's just monkeys kind of freak me out. You're in luck, then. Sonny's a chimp. I don't think I'm right for this. Sonny was a research chimp. He outgrew his usefulness. He was given to a rescue. My wife and I adopted him. We divorced and agreed to share custody. That seems fair. But she met another guy. She wants to go to Florida and take Sonny. FAYE: Sonny? Mike? That's her. That's my wife, Faye. FRED: Good morning, officers. Oh, that's him. Officers, that's Sonny. How's my baby? You called about kidnapping. You were talking about that? This is my week. My ex-husband took him. You were gonna hike him to Florida. COP 1: Control, this is 2R-13. We're code four. It's not an Amber alert. It's a monkey. He's a chimp. He's a chimp. COP 1: Parties have been advised this is a civil matter. Work this out. Let's go. I want him back. Not a chance. I have a lawyer now, Faye. We're gonna see you in court. [PRISON GATE BUZZES] [DOOR LOCK BUZZES] Who the hell are you? Samantha, my name is Bobbi Dobkins, and this is Jane Bingum. She is a lawyer. I have a public defender. Did he quit? No. But we are here to help you. My lawyer told me not to speak with anyone unless he was present. Yes, I understand. Go away. [KNOCKING THEN DOOR BUZZES] Bobbi, what's going on? Okay, she's not a family friend. Yeah, I kind of figured that out. But she's family. She doesn't know it, but she's my daughter. ♪ It was right after high school, way before I'd ever met Deb's father. He was just a boy that I really liked, and I was just stupid. Giving her up for adoption was the hardest thing I'd ever done. So how did you find her? You know, after Deb died, she was really all I could think about. So I called the adoption agency, and they gave me her name. Did you ever contact her? I wanted to, but I didn't. I just sort of watched from the sidelines. I read her Facebook and her tweets. So you cyberstalked her? Heh. Yeah. Heh. I know, it just felt selfish to disrupt her life. I mean, how do you tell a complete stranger that you're family? I understand. The defendant is charged with theft of a hard drive owned by Freemont Labs, where she worked. I didn't do it. Quiet. The drive contained proprietary information, including the formula for the product Rainbow Nail Polish. They searched my home. They didn't find anything. Ms. Colby, your outbursts are not helping your case. PROSECUTOR: The formula is valuable. It allows the polish to change color when exposed to light. Totally cool. Deb would've loved that. In addition to the theft, the only other copy of the formula was deleted from the corporate server. We allege that the defendant is responsible. Given the value, in addition to the defendant's prior conviction for possession of a narcotic... I had a bad back. My roommate gave me Percocet. The next time you move your lips, I will be holding you in contempt. We argue that bail be denied pending trial. Jane, do something. Section 502 of the Comprehensive Computer Access and Fraud Act requires unauthorized access. He said that she was an employee. And you are? Oh, right. Heh, heh. My name is Jane Bingum, and I work for Harrison & Parker. Given the public defender's case load, and apparent lack of interest in this matter, I am offering to take over her defense pro bono. Mr. Nevins, I assume you and your client are good with that? If Ms. Colby would prefer alternate counsel, I'm willing to step aside. Young lady? ♪ Okay, I guess. So ordered. Thank you. I'll pay the bail. Whatever it takes. I'm authorized to post bail should Your Honor set a reasonable amount. Bail is ordered in the amount of $100,000. The defendant will be remanded to custody until the bond is paid. [GABEL BANGS] Yes, me too. I'm looking forward to it. I'll see you tonight. Bye, Vanessa. Was that Vanessa Hemmings? I heard she was your co-counsel. Yeah, you know her? No, but I argued a case in front of Judge Hemmings, her father. Total hard-ass. Hopefully, he won't be at dinner. You know the family's loaded. They donated the entire pediatric wing of St. Katherine's. So is it a date? It's dinner. Second attempt. We were headed to a restaurant, but she got called away. I hear she's beautiful. Good for you. Can I help you with something? You know how you love to watch Animal Planet? Yeah. You make fun of me for it. Well, I'm representing a guy who's trying to keep his chimp from being taken out of the state by his ex. Don't laugh. I'm on my way to an expedited hearing. Did you know chimps are the only animals that make tools? Which I'm confident you learned from Animal Planet, therefore qualifying you as my second chair. [GIBBERING] Mike and I adopted Sonny about five years ago. We had just gotten engaged, and a friend told us about the rescue. Hey. It's his instinct to groom. It means that he likes you. He's picky. Really? [GIBBERING] Sorry, Your Honor. Sonny and I were having a misunderstanding, but we're good. Who actually purchased the chimp, Ms. Nuland? I did. I have credit-card receipts and his animal license to prove it. She happened to have her credit card. I'd like to introduce the credit-card receipts as Exhibit A the license, Exhibit B. Because Sonny was purchased prior to their wedding, he's not community property. Therefore, we ask that you declare my client Sonny's rightful owner. You're right. Paperwork's in order. I hereby rule... Hold on, Your Honor. You can't look at Sonny like he's property. Faye and Mike are de facto parents. They potty-trained him, taught him to play catch, arranged daycare. Our laws don't recognize chimp rights. Okay. But other countries are extending protections. In 2008, Spain's parliament explicitly acknowledged the rights of chimps. You're citing Spanish parliamentary law? A chimp has feelings, and this court should take them into consideration. Is this a joke? GRAYSON: No, it's not. Speaking of jokes, does Your Honor know that chimps are the only animals that laugh? No, I didn't. Can you make him laugh? No problem, Your Honor. [GIBBERING] [SONNY LAUGHING] My colleagues may harass me, but I'm going to allow a hearing It's an animal. To determine whether the chimp can be treated like a person for custody. I spoke to the clerk. She should be out in a few minutes. Good. Thank you. If I can ask, how did you afford that bond? I put my house up for collateral. Wow. I mean, you wouldn't even buy Deb a car. What? Oh. Grayson mentioned that Deb really wanted a car and you made her earn every single cent. Which was a really good lesson, by the way. Samantha is gonna wonder why a stranger posted her bail. I think you need to come clean. Oh, here she comes. Okay, breathe, breathe. Thank you for your help. And for bailing me out. [BOBBI SOBS] You're my birth mother, aren't you? Yes. I always imagined what it would be like to meet you. This isn't how it went down. I've thought about you every day of your life, Samantha. Sam. Look, lady, you gave birth to me and you gave me away. That's it. No, that's not it, Sam. This lady, she put up her home to post your bail. I need a shower and something to eat, so if you'll excuse me. Samantha, take your shower and then come to my office. We need to start on your case immediately. I'll get us all dinner. I'll accept your help and your money, but I need to be clear. My real mom died six years ago. So after this case, we go our separate ways. ♪ I can't believe you had a sister. This is huge. Half-sister. What's huge is that my mom kept it a secret from me. Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Okay, tell me all about her. Does she look like you? Talk like you? Does she use colorful accessories to break up a neutral palette like you? Actually, she seems angry and kind of cold. Well, she was just arrested. It's just she's not anything like me. I mean, the old me. Hovfs Bobbi dealing with all this? Oh, she got dinner. Chinese chicken salad from Chin Chin. Aw. That was your favorite. You loved that peanut sauce. Well, now she's hoping Sam's gonna like it too or something. Oh, my God, you're jealous. That's ridiculous. Your mom gets a chance with a new daughter, but you don't get another chance with your mom. At least not as Deb. Wow, suddenly you're Dr. Phil. I think I'm more like a blond Tyra. Stacy, Sam wants nothing to do with my mother. So I can't be jealous of a relationship that doesn't exist. Ooh, there she is. I wanna meet her. JANE: Okay. Hey, Sam. Jane. I'm Stacy. Love the jumper. So retro yet so today. Heh, heh. Thanks, I think. Oh, sweetie, rough hands. A three-minute olive-oil soak will soften them up like that. Thanks, Since. Okay. It's time for me to go. Nice to meet you, Sam. Wanna come with me? You know, that olive-oil soak thing really works. Feel my super-soft hand. You're joking. Stacy says never joke about skincare, panty lines or Brangelina, which I believe is a high-fiber cereal. Hey, babe, how's it going? Babe? I was trying something. Not at the office. Fair. Hovfs your monkey case? The case is a big fat loser. But Grayson threw a Hail Mary. Grayson? I asked him to second-chair. He was incredible. Just as the judge was about to rule against us, he stands up with a "chimps are people too" argument. One chimp, two lawyers? It seems excessive. Why don't you hand the case off to him? What's going on? It's a small case. I'm looking out for you. There's a reporter on the phone. He wants to talk to an attorney about the chimp case. Hm. That big enough for you? Big enough that I'll be taking that call. Heh. When the drive went missing, the company blamed me. Why you? I don't know. I'm just a tech. Easy person to blame, I guess. They must have something. On the night it went missing, I was the last employee to clock out. But that doesn't prove anything. Can you pass the peanut sauce? it's really delicious. My daughter used to say the same thing. Used to? She died in a car accident. I'm really sorry, Bobbi. VANESSA: I recommend the crab legs. The recipe was published in Bon Appetit. Oh, I don't eat crab. The sound of the shell cracking makes me nauseous. How's the steak? Uh, I'm sure it's delicious, but this is a seafood restaurant. So, Vanessa, when did you decide you wanted to be a lawyer? Well, I'm still not sure. I'm good at it, but who knows? Tomorrow I might wake up and decide that I wanna be a pastry chef. Oh, come on. With your father, I'm sure it was predestined. I never mentioned my father to you. His face is on the cover of California Lawyer. You didn't have to. I'm sorry. The last lawyer I dated was more interested in him than me. Okay, but that guy isn't me. Right. Yeah, that was unfair. I'm sorry. Hey, so have you...? Have you ever been to the L.A. Phil? Friday night Dudamel opened with Mahler's First and closed with Bernstein's Second. It was magnificent. Heh. You ever make it out to Dodger Stadium? Friday night, Dodgers down 5-2, Manny hits a grand slam. Now, that was magnificent. [CLEARS THROAT] Heh, heh. ♪ Thanks. Look. That splash of color you ordered finally arrived. What do you think? They're okay. I know that voice. What's wrong? The world is too small, and it just keeps getting smaller. This is gonna sound crazy, but this is not the life I am supposed to be living. It just messes with my head. Does someone need a shot of Easy Cheese? Yeah, I'll be fine, Teri. Once you start thinking you have to take a certain path, you set yourself up for disappointment. Like, when I was 10, I wanted to be a firefighter. And when I was 12, I wanted to be president. And at 16, a bank robber. But now I am perfectly content being your assistant. Really? I still got plenty of time to rob banks. Jane, you got a sec? Yeah. I was just leaving. Heard Bobbi was here. Everything okay? Oh, yeah, fine. I'd like to know what's going on. I promised confidentiality. If she's here on business, I'll read the new client memo, but I'd rather hear it from you. Okay, fine. Take a seat. It turns out that Bobbi had a daughter before Deb. She gave her up for adoption. I'm representing her. Why are you smiling? I thought you'd be shocked. Deb wanted a sister. Maybe so, but I'm sure not like this. No, she would have loved the drama. She'd have welcomed her with open arms. Okay. Changing the subject. Heh. What's going on with you and Vanessa? I heard about your date. Yeah, well, that may be over before it starts. Oh, well. We're from two different worlds. I respect her, she's beautiful, but she's upper crust and I'm not. You think she's out of your league? I didn't say... I mean, you and Deb weren't exactly from the same worlds. From what I've heard. I mean, Stacy told me that you knew nothing about dance and Deb introduced you to the ballet, right? Well, she took me to The Nutcracker. And you brought her into your world too, I would assume. I got her to love the Lakers. Right. Because anything that brought you that much joy, she wanted to be a part of. I mean, look, Grayson, it sounds like Vanessa isn't the right woman, but don't sell yourself short. Thanks, Jane. Yeah. ♪ GRAYSON: You know a lot about chimps, don't you? Before adopting Sonny, I read everything I could. Tell me about their DNA. Research has proven that human beings and chimps share 98.5 percent of the same DNA. Do they experience cognitive activity? Yes, and they have a rich emotional life. They experience grief, jealousy, remorse, even empathy. Thank you. Is 98.5 percent the same as 100 percent? Uh, no. Last March, did Sonny escape and damage a neighbor's garage door? Yeah, he's like a child that way. Are you aware that a chimp attacked a trainer, almost killing her? After that, do you feel comfortable comparing a wild animal to a child? That was a very tragic event, but... No further questions. In the reference to chimp attack, were there special circumstances? That chimp suffered from Lyme disease, which affected his brain. And does Sonny have Lyme disease? No. I'll make sure that he remains healthy and safe. If, hypothetically, the court decides to treat Sonny as a human, how do you know he wants to stay in California? He told me so. He told you? Yeah, I taught Sonny sign language. Objection. This has gone from ridiculous to absurd. I never thought I'd say these words, but I wanna hear from the chimp. [GIBBERING] Excuse me, Ms. Bingum. Can I help you? I'm Nick Coleman, CEO of Freemont Labs. I wanted to give you a heads-up. A heads-up? I spoke with the ADA, and if your client returns the hard drive before trial, the ADA will drop charges. I told you, I didn't take anything. Sorry, Mr. Coleman, but thanks for the heads-up. PROSECUTOR: Ms. Simpson, you hired the defendant, correct? SIMPSON: Yes, several years ago. She reports to me. Could you explain why the Rainbow Nail Polish formula is so important to your company? Freemont recently struck a multimillion-dollar deal to manufacture Rainbow-branded nail polish for Trilling Cosmetics. The deal is in jeopardy. Why not re-create the formula? That could take months. Mr. Trilling fears another company could get their hands on the formula. At this point, the state would like to introduce Exhibit A: Security footage of Samantha Colby leaving Freemont with the hard drive. Objection. We had no notice of a video. We informed prior counsel and offered a copy on receipt of a blank DVD. We never got one. The tape wasn't produced. Well, prior counsel was an overworked public defender and never mentioned the video. Not the court's problem. Counselor. You can see from the time-stamp it's 11:49 p.m. Samantha Colby is headed towards the rear exit. The crime lab enhanced the object in her left hand. Ms. Simpson, is that the missing hard drive? Yes. You can see the lab's logo as well as a tracking number. ♪ Ms. Bingum, do you have any questions for the witness? Um... No, Your Honor, not at this time. ♪ Why did you lie to us, Sam? Look, Samantha, we're going to help you no matter what, but we need you to be honest with us. It's not what it seems. We saw the video. My first lawyer said nobody would believe the truth. Try me. I didn't steal the formula from Freemont Labs. They stole it from me. What? I have a degree in chemical engineering. That's true. I follow you on Facebook. You graduated with honors. I tried to get a job as an engineer. Nobody would hire me because of my record. Bad back. It's pain medication. I'm up to speed. So I took this job as a technician, and I spent my nights developing Rainbow Polish. A month ago, I pitched the project to Anne Simpson, my boss. She stole your idea? Yeah. And then she sold it to Ryan Trilling, the president of Trilling Cosmetics. He said Rainbow Polish is the biggest thing since waterproof mascara. And the worst part... is that Trilling was the inspiration for the product. Four years ago, he spoke to my engineering class and told us that we should follow our passion. Nail polish is your passion? No. Jane, my passion is science. Oh. He said we would find success if we could figure out a way to use science to improve an everyday product. And that's what I did. Does it really work? I mean, does it really change colors? I have a prototype. I can show you. Okay, I'll start by asking him some simple questions. Where is Sonny? Okay. Where is Faye? [GIBBERING] So he taught the chimp tricks. Can we please put an end to this nonsense? My goldfish comes to the surface when I feed it. Doesn't make him Einstein. I'm inclined to agree. No, we're communicating. Just watch. Sonny, I love you. [GIBBERING] And he loves me. Sonny, do you want to live with me, or with Faye? Sonny, where do you want to live? All right. As much as I've enjoyed this case and as moved as I am by Sonny's connection with Mr. Barry, I can't make new law. The chimp is property, and it belongs to Ms. Nuland. FAYE: Thank you. Sonny, come on. I'm sorry, buddy. I tried. Come here. I love you, buddy. You be good, little guy. ♪ ♪ STACY Let me get this straight. The polish you created can really change colors? You bet. This perfect-for-the-daytime pink, changes to an out-on-the-town red when I do this. STACY: Wow. If you wanna change it back to pink, just flash them again. I have four different color combos. Oh! Let me try. This is amazing, Sam. How does this work? Light photons activate color pigments... Causing the molecules to form free radicals that absorb and reflect different-colored wavelengths. [LAUGHS] I'm impressed. So am I. I'm confused. If you created the formula, why didn't you tell the judge? Because I can't prove anything. I gave Anne everything that I had. Oh, what a bitch. You're growing on me. Okay, forget the judge. What about that Trilling guy? He'd like to know that her boss is a big fat liar. You're right. If Sam can plead her case to Trilling, then he can sway the ADA to dig a little deeper. But how do we get Sam and Trilling together? He puts everything on his Twitter. Oh! I'm on it. Searching, searching. Oh, I got it. Okay. He's attending a charity event tonight at the Van Nuys Airport. Ladies, let's get dressed. We're going out. Vanessa. Grayson. What are you doing here? Your office said your case was adjourned early. I was hoping we could have dinner. Heh. After last night, I wasn't sure there'd be a second date. First dates are always awkward. Yes. Okay, yeah. I can have my assistant make us reservations. No need. I brought fried chicken, salad and fries. It's a warm night. How about a picnic? That sounds different. And delightful. My favorite bench is over here. Lead the way. Heh. [CHATTERING] WOMAN 1: it's really exciting. WOMAN 2: Yeah, it's good. WOMAN 3: Oh, hi. Oh, look, shrimp cocktail. No, Stacy. We're here on business. Right. There's Trilling in the white jacket. STACY: And there's Travis, his cute nephew. I saw his picture on Facebook. Nice work. Okay, Stacy, go distract the nephew. Okay. And, Sam, go plead your case. I can do it. Come on. Hi. Do I know you from somewhere? I don't think so. Can I get you a drink? How about some shrimp? Sure. Mr. Trilling? Yes? You don't know me. My name is Samantha. Sam, what are you doing here? Security. Mr. Trilling, just hear me out. This woman stole the Rainbow formula. Mr. Trilling. And this is her attorney. Hello. Nice to meet you. Would you escort Ms. Colby and Ms. Bingum out? They're not welcome. Just wait. She just needs a moment. She... OW! SECURITY: This way. Ooh. Cute dress. Owl SECURITY: Let's go. Um... Will you excuse me for just a moment? Hi, Bobbi. Stacy. What? Ahem. All right, so you're wearing the polish. You need to talk to Mr. Trilling. All right, I'll try. Okay. All right. Excuse me, Mr. Trilling. This sounds strange, but would you take a look at my fingernails? They're very nice. Yes, well, look... HOW. You're wearing Rainbow Polish. How is that possible? If you wanna know the truth about the deal with Freemont, come to court tomorrow. Trust me. Okay, we should go. ♪ Trilling isn't here. This is bad. I know. PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, I object. Ms. Bingum had an opportunity to cross Ms. Simpson. I only have a few questions and in the interest of justice, I ask you allow me to proceed. Well, then by all means. Thank you. Um... Okay. Heh. Just a second. Ms. Bingum, the witness is over here. Right. Ms. Simpson, you hired Samantha Colby, correct? Yes, I already said that I did. Right. Get to the point or sit down. Okay. Can you tell me why you chose the name Rainbow for your nail polish? Um... Sure. The color changes when it's exposed to light. And the rainbow represents a spectrum of colors. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Your Honor, the defense would like to call Samantha Colby to the stand. Who came up with the name Rainbow Polish? I did. I was a student at Santa Monica Tech when Mr. Trilling spoke about using science to improve a product. What was the name of the auditorium where he spoke? He spoke at Rainbow Hall. I named the product Rainbow because it was inspired by that talk. In the business plan used to sell Rainbow to Trilling Cosmetics, there were four versions. What were they called? Creativity, Tenacity, Inspiration and Passion. And why those names? Because those are Mr. Trilling's four pillars of success. So why did you take the hard drive? Because the formula was mine. I created it. I gave Ms. Simpson my business plan. She claimed it as her own. I'm sorry that I caused all of this commotion, but I'm telling the truth. The defendant is accused of wiping a corporate server and stealing a hard drive. We ask that her testimony be stricken as irrelevant. He's right. The jury will disregard. Your Honor... Ms. Bingum, if your client was wronged, there were other ways to handle her grievance. The state asks for a short recess. Yes, I think we can all use a break. [GAVEL BANGS] The judge was right. There were other ways I could've handled this. I screwed up. You were trying to protect yourself. Regardless of what that judge said, the jury heard that you created the formula. The jury has to disregard the testimony, but that's okay. You were performing for an audience of one. Here he comes. Excuse me, ladies. Would you join me for a moment? Ryan, this woman's not only a thief, she's a liar. We're suggesting that the ADA add perjury to her charges. We're back in business. Full speed ahead. That's great news. TRILLING: On two conditions. Inform the ADA nothing was stolen from your company. Then hire Ms. Colby to supervise production of Rainbow Polish. Ryan, she's a tech. You have to believe me. Anne, if this nail polish is your creation, how did you select the names of the four color combinations? I heard your speech. Like she said, it was a tribute to you and the four pillars of success. Hm. What's the fifth pillar? Excuse me? If you've heard that speech, you'd know there's another pillar. This is ridiculous. Sam, what's the fifth pillar? Honesty. Never over-promise and never sell yourself short. Anne, you're fired. Sam, welcome back. Thank you. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] GRAYSON: How's it going? You haven't said a word to me since we lost our case. You all right? I'm fine. I just don't like to lose. You know what gets me, is that Sonny belongs with our client and there's no law that says so. It just... It makes me feel so... Helpless? Yeah, what you said. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] FAYE: Excuse me. Ms. Nuland, what are you doing here? No matter how hard I try, I can't make Sonny laugh. I never could. How can we help you? I had to argue that Sonny was property, and that felt wrong. Well, it was wrong. The receipt and Sonny's license. I'd like to spend one day with him. Mike can pick him up in the morning. You're giving him to Mike? It's in Sonny's best interest. Isn't that the standard a judge applies when deciding where a child belongs? Yeah, that's right. Okay. Goodbye. I gotta get back to work. Go on. Hey, Goofy Grin, what's up? Oh, we lost the chimp case, but Sonny still ended up with our client. I'm happy for him. For the chimp or the client? Both. Heh, heh, heh. Oh, by the way, I owe you a big thank-you. For what? For encouraging me to give Vanessa another chance. What? Yeah, you put things in perspective. We had dinner last night. Oh. A picnic. Heh, heh. We had a great time. We sat on a bench, we ate fast food. It was... Heh, heh. If she can live in my world, I can live in hers. Well, then I guess I give great advice. Heh, heh. Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. All right. Bye-bye. ♪ I heard the chimp ended up with your client. Yeah. Gotta love a happy ending, right? You know, you and Grayson are both excellent lawyers. In the future, I'm not sure it's prudent to have you two work on the same case. Purely from a business perspective. Huh. Well, we come from different perspectives, but we bounce really well off of each other. Still, I have to manage the assets. I'm not sure we get enough bang for that bounce. If you don't want me working with Grayson, say so. No, I'm not making a rule, but the firm is best served if... No, I get it. I used to date him. Now I date you. Is that what this is about? Of course not. Heh. Good, because, um, you not being jealous is really cute. I've gotta get to a client dinner. Mm-hm. Have a good night, babe. [SHAWN McDONALD'S 'CLOSER' PLAYING] How you holding up? Great. We won our case, and Sam and Bobbi are on good terms. Everything is great. Well, that's great. Now, how do you really feel? I'm sad. Heh. Sam and Bobbi are out celebrating right now. They're bonding over Chinese chicken salad or something else that I probably enjoyed. You know, they're mother and daughter. I'm just Jane, the hired help. I don't think so. What else would I be? Why don't you ask them? Jane? Oh, I'm so glad we caught you. We thought you left. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah We're going out to celebrate. Please say you'll join us. Oh. Um... I'd love to. Great. Great. Okay. [SHAWN McDONALD'S "CLOSER" CONTINUES PLAYING] ♪
