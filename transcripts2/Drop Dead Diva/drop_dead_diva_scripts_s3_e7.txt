 See that aspiring model there? That was me... Deb. Until the day I died. I thought I'd go straight to Heaven, but there was a bit of a mix-up, and I woke up in someone else's body. So now I'm Jane, a super-busy lawyer with my very own assistant. I got a new life, a new wardrobe, and the only people who really know what's going on with me are my girlfriend Stacy and my guardian angel, Fred. I used to think everything happened for a reason...

 Whoo! ...and, well, I sure hope I was right. Drop Dead Diva 3x07 - Mothers' Day Original air date August 7, 2011 Sync and corrected by atrn97g www.addic7ed.com I can't believe it. I got a print solo! Well, Deb did. Like I said... Oh, of course. It's amazing. You totally make me want to gamble and eat shrimp. - Really? - Mm-hmm. That is so sweet. So, when did you shoot it? It's from that session I did with Javier. He must have sold the photo to Sierra Casino.

 - You know who's gonna love this? - Who? Grayson. I can't wait to show him. Ooh. What are you writing? A little note for Fred. I put them in his lunch every day. Aww, my mom used to do the same thing. What did you say? Stacy, why did you let me oversleep? I get up with the sun, Fred. You need to set an alarm. I'm gonna miss the bus. Not if you hurry. Peanut butter and jelly again? And where's the note? I am not your mother! If we don't have to talk about what just happened, I'll give you a ride to the office. Grayson. - Hey, Jane. - Hi. So, you've seen the "L.A. Weekly". Yeah. Deb's ad for Sierra Casino. It's demeaning and offensive. - What? No, no. - Not to mention they didn't have permission to use the photograph. Oh, no, I'm sure they did. I reviewed all of Deb's contracts. Trust me... I'd know if she agreed to promote "home of the bottomless shrimp cocktail." I'm gonna fight this. Good morning! - Hi. - Hi. Oh, my God. W... what are you doing to my contract with Javier? There's no way you can sign this. Of course I can. It's for my shoot tomorrow. Deb, this contract grants him perpetual rights. - Do you know what that means? - Yes. No. It means he owns every picture he takes of you, from now till the end of time. All you get are copies for yourself. I know. It's fantastic... free photos. Look, everyone else signs these contracts. Hey, I just want you to protect yourself. But when they see this... Think how much more they're gonna respect you. Come on, Deb. I know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'd do without you. Hey, Stace. Did Grayson see the ad? Oh, yeah, he saw it, through his lawyerly, overprotective eyes. Stacy, he says he thinks it's demeaning. Oh! As if. You look smokin' hot. Grayson's problem is that - he's always been a little too... - Oh, my God! Stacy, my mom's in the office! Which one... Deb's mom or Jane's mom? No, Deb's mom... my mom... is in the office... Bobbi. I'm gonna go say hello to her. Ow! Ow! Jane, are you okay? - You need to see this. - Hold on, Stacy. What are you doing? A passenger went bonkers and triggered the emergency slide. They're showing the replay now. - Teri, I'm on the phone. - Wait for it. Breaking news from Los Angeles International Airport, where passenger - Elaine Bingum was arrested this morning... - Oh, my God. ...following her unscheduled departure. My mom's on the news. I thought she was in the office. She is. Deb's mom is in the office. Jane's mom is on TV. I got to go. So, this isn't live, is it? No, it happened 30 minutes ago. Which means I'm gonna get a call from the jail any minute. Ms. Bingum's office. Yes, she is, officer. Tell them I'm on my way. She's on her way. Thank you. Janie. Are you off your meds again? Nice to see you, too, dear. And, no, I haven't missed a day. Okay. Then what happened? We were trapped in that tin can for almost six hours... crying babies, crying parents, and don't even get me started about the smell. - Where's dad? - On a fishing boat in Mexico. We took separate vacations. Oh, don't worry... it's not like that. It's just he wanted Baja. I wanted Branson. Did you know Andy Williams has his own theater? Focus. Mom, these are federal charges. - You are in real trouble. - Oh, come on. How bad could it be? "Interfering with a flight crew, criminal tampering," "reckless endangerment." Do we have a plea? Not guilty. And I ask that my client be released on her own recognizance. The government requests $200,000 bail. $200,000?! - For opening a door?! - Shh! The defendant shut down an international airport, triggering a Homeland Security response. Well, Homeland Security should have spent that money rescuing my client, who was held hostage by Eastwest Airlines. And $9 for a sandwich in the terminal... - now, that's the real crime. - Okay. The charges are serious, but the government appears to be overreaching on bail. Thank you, your Honor. $10,000, cash or bond. You want me to sue the casino over this ad? They're exploiting Deb's image. And they think they can get away with it because - there's no one to protect her, but... - They're wrong. I don't have standing to sue because we were never married. As her mother, you do. Okay. If this is what you want... Let's sue the bastards. My favorite four words: "let's sue the bastards". Bobbi, this is Jay Parker. Of "Harrison &." Of course. I'm Bobbi Dobkins. I trust Grayson's taking good care of you. Oh, yeah, he's the best. That's why I hired him. It's a pleasure to meet you. Anyway, uh, feel free to call me directly if you need anything at all. I will do that. Fred, what are you doing? The Barnard Liquors contract isn't gonna redline itself. Stacy yelled at me. Oh, God. She said she's not my mother. What do you think she means? Well, not a lot to decipher there. She doesn't want to take care of you. This happens in relationships where the woman is the Alpha personality. Trust me... I've been there. So, what can I do? Before Stacy, you were your own man, right? I mean, you had interests and hobbies. Right, yeah... I... interests, hobbies. Now you're just a satellite revolving around planet Stacy. Okay. How do I break her gravitational pull? Don't let her mother you. Be your own man. Sometimes, just the threat of pulling away makes a woman want you more. - Oh, one more thing. - Yeah? Redline the contracts by lunch or hire me a new assistant. I don't know how to thank you, Janie. Just don't get into any more trouble while you're here. Well, it's nice to see you, no matter what the circumstances. - Maybe it's fate. - Nope. A federal offense... not fate. Hey, how about lunch? The in-flight magazine mentioned this great shabu-shabu place in Little Tokyo. Oh, I can't today. There's somebody at the office I really need to see. But, um, I'll... I'll see you tonight. Okay, here. Why don't you take a cab? And I'll be home by 7:00, okay? Make it $40. If the cab doesn't smell, I like to tip. On behalf of Sierra Casino, we reject your cease-and-desist letter. We're also pursuing a claim of unjust enrichment. There's been no breach of contract, - and, therefore, no unjust enrichment. - Not true. - Oh, I'm sorry. I thought the room was free. - Hi, Jane. Hi, Bobbi. What a surprise. Oh! Hi. Well, now, what's going on here? We are suing Sierra Casino to stop using Deb in their advertising. Why... why would you do that? Without me? Grayson, I am here to help. - Ah. - Um... Okay. Jane handled an intellectual-property case for us last month. We are happy to have her on board. Actually, we're done. There's no merit to your request. You used a photograph of Deb Dobkins without consent. My client bought that picture directly from the photographer. Javier. I recognize his work. He had no right to sell it. Javier had a standard contract with the model, all rights in perpetuity, which he, in turn, signed over to us. - Huh... - Yeah, and... okay, well, I guess that's that. I'm familiar with the contract. It had significant limitations. Let's take a look, shall we? I love him, Stacy, but he's out of control. Look, he lawyered all over it. You can't give that to Javier. He'll replace you. - I know. - You're gonna get a bad reputation... and not the good kind. You'll be the crazy model with the crazier lawyer boyfriend. What should I do? Um, tell Grayson that you appreciate his concern, but... Oh, no. No. I... I don't like confrontation. It gives you premature frown lines. Oh, all right. Well... ...then I have three words for you... "li-quid paper". Mm. I'm pretty certain Deb didn't white-out the changes I made to this contract. Actually, I think she did. Her initials are beside every bit of white-out. The ad tested well. Really? Mm. It's going to remain the centerpiece of the casino's new campaign. And... now we're done. Hey. Hey. Fred, can you be a love and go to the store for me? The girls are coming over for "the bachelor" and bubbly, but we're out of champagne. Tonight? No. No, no, no, no. I can't. I'm... I'm watching a... a History Channel documentary on beer. I don't think so. There's only one TV, and you don't even like beer. You're a white-wine-spritzer guy. Well, not anymore. In fact, I'm learning how to brew my own beer. It's my new hobby. Where do you think you're going to brew beer? In the laundry room. There's no space in the laundry room. Okay, you know something, Stacy? I am losing myself in this relationship. - What? - Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm not just a satellite revolving around planet Stacy. What did you say? Did I mumble? I... I'm my own man, Stacy. Well, if you're your own man, maybe you should get your own place. Well, maybe I will! Jane, so sorry to interrupt. Wait. You're never sorry unless you've got bad news. My mom was watching CNN, and it turns out your mom is about to be interviewed by Nancy Grace. No, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes. Live, in studio... the "mad as hell" passenger from flight 82. - But she's at my house. - No, I just called your house. She isn't picking up her cell, either. Turn on the TV. Some people refer to Elaine Bingum as "a folk hero." Oh, my God. Elaine, folk hero... yes, no, maybe? Well, actually, I just did the right thing. I knew the minute I went down that slide that the airplane doors would open and let the captives free. You were arrested. Yes, I know, but so was Paul Revere. Nancy, between the two of us, it isn't the first time for me. - Yikes. - Are you telling me that you are a repeat offender? Shoplifting, trespass, arson... oh, and I almost forgot... indecent exposure. - Oh, my God! Stop talking! - But this time, little girl, you've got a bigger problem. Aren't you a little afraid? I'm worried, but my daughter is representing me. Her name is Jane. She's my rock. And I just have to say, to all you eligible men out there, she's single. She's pimping you out on national TV. Good to know. We'll be right back with "folk hero" Elaine Bingum. Okay. I... I have to get down there. Any potential juror watching this is gonna think she's... - Eccentric? - ...Completely nuts. She might as well skip the trial and go right to jail. Have you seen Elaine? She went speed-walking. Apparently, it's good for the hips. By the way, I think she's a little peeved at you. Yeah, 'cause I yelled at her for going on national TV without my permission. Mm. Oh, my God. Sweetie, you eating a bagel? Oh, it's my second one. I'm so upset. I got in a fight with Fred, - and I think he moved out. - What? He said something about not wanting to watch "The Bachelor" and brewing beer and being his own man, and then the door slammed. Huh. That's... that's interesting. Oh, my God. You think this is my fault? No, it's just... well, I mean, yesterday, you didn't like that he was acting like a little boy. - Mm-hmm. - And today, you don't like that he's acting like a man. I mean, it's really just a theory, but maybe you gave him mixed messages. Well, I just want him back. If you want my advice, just go tell him you're sorry. Well, that is a great idea. I will pack him a lunch with a note and a very clear message. Good. Mom, I'm sorry I yelled at you. It's fine, dear. You missed a fantabulous walk. Look at me. I have the hips of a 26-year-old and the buns of a bobcat. R-r-r-r-r! Are we ready for court? Uh, I am, but you need to shower and change. But Stacy will give you a lift to the office. Mm-hmm. I heard that! Yeah. Aah! Aah! Aah! What do you think you're doing? Um, you know how you said I needed to stake out my own turf? No, no, no... not on my couch. I can't afford my own place. - So get a roommate. - Unless you gave me a raise, I would need like nine roommates. Well, you can't stay here. Look, I'm following your advice, but if it's gonna work, I need your support. Fine. I have a client. He owns a shipping company. Six months out of the year, he's in Europe. He needs a house sitter. I could do that. Oh, whoa! Um, okay. I will put his number on your desk. Wait for me to leave the room, and then... put on your pants. - Jane, good morning. - Morning. The AUSA just faxed over a witness list. It's got every passenger from flight 82, as well as seven crew members and all airport employees with access to the plane. They're trying to bury us. There's no way I can prep for this many witnesses. Wait. Teri, do you have the flight manifest? The manifest has eight crew members, and the witness list has seven. Can you find... Jane? Um... sorry. Can you find out why the AUSA left a flight attendant off the witness list? And when my mom gets here, just put her in my office. Done and done. Hey, you're back. We're re-strategizing. We are? O... okay. There's a loophole in Deb's contract. It expressly forbids significant alterations or manipulations. Grayson, that's pretty standard. I mean, is there anything else that we can... I found the original photo in Deb's portfolio. You can see the ad has been photoshopped. They added earrings, changed her dress. They whitened her teeth. Well, it... it just doesn't seem that significant, and... and her teeth really were that white. I've seen other photos. Well, "significant" is subjective. Okay, well, thank you, Grayson. But I should go. I have lunch plans. Oh, have fun. Bobbi? - Can I ask you something? - Sure. Do you think that Deb would have had a problem with the ad? I mean, you were her mom. Grayson's the man she loved, and I see how much he wants to protect Deb and keep her memory alive. What mother could say no to that? Honey, who's your friend? Oh, um... Bobbi, this is my mother, Elaine. Ah, you must be very proud of your daughter. She's represented me a few times. - Really? - Oh, yeah. We're the middle of something right now, as a matter of fact. It's just a minor matter, but yesterday, she jumped in without my even asking her. Wow. While working on my case, which is no minor matter. I could go to jail. Yeah, speaking of which, we should get to court. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Bobbi. - Hmm? You ready for lunch? Yeah, I'm starved. - Great. I'll meet you in the lobby. - Okay. I'm sorry. Is... is Parker on the case? No, no. We're just having lunch. Lunch? And last night, we had dinner. Dinner. They're having lunch. Yes, dear. - We all date. We all love to have sex. - Ew. - Why, last week, your father and I... - Please stop talking. I mean, uh, save your voice for court. Stacy. - Can I help you? - I'm just looking for Fred. Oh, he's gone for the afternoon. He's checking out his new pad. - I'm sorry? - Yeah, he's totally psyched. It's got an infinity pool, home theater, spare room for his Barley and Hops. - I see. - I'm playing catch-up here. What happened? Did he eat crackers in your satin sheets? Well, yes. But that wasn't the problem. Can I just say that Freddy is really growing up fast? - If that's for him, he already ate. - But I'm famished. Oh, don't. "I miss you more than I can say." "Come on home, for a great..." Stop! Just please don't tell him I was here. After about four hours on the tarmac, people started to get upset, and it fell to me to keep everybody calm. It fell to you? I'm a natural leader. And I have proof. I took Dr. Phil's online personality quiz. So you leapt into action. I led a sing-along. I, uh, encouraged people to share their food. And when 32C had a panic attack, I got him a Xanax from 4B. And I taught a new mother how to make a diaper out of a pillowcase. Sounds like you made the best of an awful situation. But why open the emergency door? The plane was a boiling teakettle ready to explode. And, um... I knew it was against the rules, but it was a matter of life and death. Thank you. Life and death. Was, uh, someone literally about to die? I don't know. I don't have a crystal ball. Well, tell me, Ms. Bingum, do you look like you're facing mortal danger here? I'm happy to be free. Whee! Do you know that the emergency slide deploys with the force of 3,000 pounds per square inch? No. Did you know that, seconds before you pulled the slide, there were baggage handlers working outside the plane and that the slide could have killed them? I had no idea. I've seen you on TV, Ms. Bingum. Oh. You enjoying the talk-show circuit? - Objection. - Withdrawn. Why didn't you prepare me for those questions? I warned you that it was gonna get ugly and that they were gonna try and make you look like... - like I murdered people with a slide? - Yes. Believe me... I would have remembered that. You know, maybe if you weren't squeezing me in between meetings with Barbie... Her name is Bobbi. And is that what's upsetting you? Because I'm always here when you need me. Yes, when I'm in trouble. But when is the last time you've come by to visit or called to say hello? You know what? I get busy. And... And if there is no emergency, it's like I don't exist. Is Elaine asleep? I can't tell, 'cause she's not talking to me right now. Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, whatever. All right. What's the latest with Fred? I think I lost him, Jane. No, you... you just pushed him to be his own man, and now you have to love him for it. You know, it's just like that song. - What song? - I don't know... any song... "Blah, blah, blah, if you love him, set him free." You're right. Okay, tomorrow, I'm going to show him I support his... manhood. - Good. - Yeah. Aren't you going to bed? No, I've got work to do. - On Elaine's case? - Bobbi's case. I didn't even tell you. The casino wants to use me as part of a multi-stage ad campaign. I know. But Grayson's still trying to squelch it. Oh. What are you gonna do? Well, I know exactly what Grayson's going to argue in court. So I'd say there's a good chance the casino's lawyer is going to get an anonymous e-mail explaining exactly how to argue every counterpoint. Whoa. You're forming a secret alliance, like on "Survivor." Well, you know, the way I see it is that I am using back channels to represent my client's best interest, and it just so happens that my client is me. Ooh. Good morning. - Morning to you. - Hold on. - I spoke to a friend at the AUSA's office. - Sorry. Turns out the missing flight attendant you asked me to track down was visiting her sick mother in Florida. That's why they took her off the list. Okay, dead end. Can I please go to my office? Unlike the prosecution, I do not give up that easily. I did some digging. Get this... the flight attendant's mom isn't sick. She's dead... died three years ago. Why would she lie about that? You're about to find out. You're meeting her for coffee in 20 minutes. - Here's the address. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. You won't tell them I'm not in Florida, will you? Ms. Laferty, I don't want to cause you any trouble. I just want to know why you lied about being out of town. I don't want to testify against your mom. I've worked lots of delayed flights. This was the worst. Why not say that in court? The airline dropped plenty of hints. If we support her, our jobs aren't safe. I understand. Off the record, can you tell me how the situation got so bad? I mean, what about the new flyers' bill of rights? It mandates that airlines provide food and water and a chance to get off the plane after two hours. The clock doesn't start until we leave the gate. If they know there's going to be a long delay, they hold us at the gate for hours before moving us to the tarmac. That's horrible. Mm-hmm. You know... your mom led the passengers in stretching exercises when they started complaining about leg cramps. Mm, yeah. Oh, she was amazing. - She kept everyone calm. - Really? You're lucky to have a mom like her... so much energy and compassion. Thanks. Your Honor, an injunction is required - to avoid irreparable harm. - What harm? Her daughter signed a contract granting rights for all uses of her image. "All" means all. Mr. Kent? There was no contract. McClintock v. Skelly Oil... - "A meeting of the minds is..." - ...essential to the formation of a contract? That isn't the standard here. I disagree. Ms. Dobkins was never informed changes would be made to her photograph. Therefore, she cannot be... ...Presumed to have consented to such changes? Next, Mr. Kent's going to tell us that, since there was no consent, there was no contract. As a matter of fact... The relevant case is Time v. Conroy... when parties possess a level of expertise in relevant areas, consent is implied. I've heard enough. I'll let you know when I've made my decision. Mr. Beiner, you are vice president for passenger safety and welfare for Eastwest Airlines? Correct. And your job is to ensure that Eastwest follows all federal laws? That's right. Isn't it true that your airline knowingly overbooks flights? Objection... relevance. Sustained. Isn't it true that you miscode delays as weather-related to avoid paying customers a full refund? Objection... relevance again. Sustained again. Tell us about passenger migration, when you keep passengers on planes during delays rather than return them to the terminal so that they won't leave and fly with one of your competitors. - Your Honor! - Enough. Counselors, approach the bench. The witness may step down. Ms. Bingum, where are you getting your allegations? A confidential source. The airline is not on trial here. Of course the airline's on trial. The airline created an explosive situation and shouldn't be able to hold themselves unaccountable when a passenger acts out in a foreseeable way. It's all irrelevant. Your client broke the law. The airline pushed her into an untenable predicament. Enough. Your allegations are off limits. Your Honor, it's res gestae. I need to set the scene for the jury. I am sympathetic, but you're going to have to find another way to do so. Okay. Congratulations, Fred. You're not Fred. Nope. I'm Calvin. Why are you in Fred's house? This is not Fred's house. It's my house. Again, I'm Calvin. Okay, let's start over. I thought Fred was house-sitting. Oh, my lawyer's assistant? - Yeah, I interviewed him. It didn't work out. - What? Why not? Well, I said I needed a 30-day commitment, and he said 30 days was too long to be away from the person who completes him, the one who makes him whole, the girl whose breath wakes him every morning... ...which I think he meant as a compliment. - He said all that? - Yeah. He was pretty dramatic. I take it you're that girl? I am. Can I keep the plant? I don't think so. Ooh. Please tell me there's something chocolaty in there. I've had a rough day. Yeah, you and me both. Mm-hmm. I got ambushed in court today. The casino was amazingly well-prepared. I'm sorry about that. I'm countering tomorrow with Brighton v. Houghton. It limits permissible alterations to intellectual property. Yeah, I forgot about that one. If that fails, I'll just keep filing motions till they're sick of me. Okay. I'm gonna get back to work. - Hey. - Hi. How was the shoot? Awesome. I was in the zone. I bet. I can't wait to see the pictures. Listen... about the contracts... They had a problem with the changes? - No. - Give me their number. - I don't mind kicking a little... - No, you don't have to kick anything. They were totally... ...cool with it. They were? Nobody said a word. Great. Yeah. All right. She would have loved it. Hi. What's that? The ad. You asked me what Deb would have thought. I think she would have loved it. I know I do. Me too. She looks so pretty. Yeah. Well, what are you doing here? Are you meeting with Grayson? Uh, no, another date with Jay. Oh. Parker? Mm-hmm. Jane, when I told you the other day that I was going out with Jay, you winced. I winced? Kind of like what you're doing right now. Oh. Sorry. All right, here's the thing. Before this goes any further, before I get any more invested, is there something that I need to know about him... I mean, anything that, you know, would cause you to wince? Okay. Um, Parker is smart and funny and capable of occasional moments of depth, but he has left more than a few hearts broken in his wake. And you don't want him to break mine. No. Oh... Well, what if I told you I hear everything you're saying and I still want to go out with him? Then I'd say that you don't need my permission. Yeah. All right, what are we gonna do about this? Um... I'm gonna talk to Grayson. Thank you for looking out for me... ...and for Deb. Oh, come on! Get up! Uh, I can explain. Really? I'd like to hear it. Can I... can I talk to Fred in private? You have two minutes to talk and disinfect my sofa. I heard about your new house. I was gonna stop by. Yeah, actually... But then I decided I didn't want to see it. I know that you're your own man and you're independent, but the thing is, I've kind of started to depend on you. I want you back. It's not home without you. What do you say? Well, if it means that much to you... It does. You can even do your beer thing in the laundry room. Do I have to? Absolutely not. And if it's okay with you, I'd still like to make you lunch. I could live with that. Look inside. "Welcome home." Hey, do you have a minute? - Can it wait till I finish this motion? - Sure. Uh, no, actually, it can't. Um, I think I know why Deb ignored your changes on her contract. Do you? Yes. Models are a lot tougher than you think, and they have to deal with so much rejection. Sometimes I try and help Stacy, and she gets really upset because she doesn't necessarily want my help... she just... she just wants me to tell her that she's doing fine. And I think maybe Deb felt the same way. You didn't know her. No, I... I didn't. But I do know you. And I know how hard you fight to protect the people you care about. And I am sure that Deb would have been grateful. You know? But... but when I... when I look at this picture, I can't help but think how much she would have loved it. I mean, it's what models work for. And I know... I know it's not a high-fashion magazine, but... but she looks gorgeous. And maybe I'm overstepping when I say this, but I think, in this case, she would have wanted you to hold your advice and just tell her that she was doing fine. - Janie. - Oh! I'm sorry I startled you. What's going on? I want to apologize, Janie. You were right. I crash in on your life like a tornado and expect you to drop everything for me. No, it's... it's okay. And you know what? You're right. Because I... I do... I get distracted by life And I should call you more often. I'm sorry I made things harder by acting like a goofball. It's okay. But you should know... it's just because I'm scared. Why are you scared? What if we lose? I just can't go to jail... Or... Canada. Oh, God, no. Then we better not lose. You know, mom, I don't say it, but I really admire your energy... and your compassion. I'm really lucky to be your daughter. Oh, God, you were just great in court yesterday. And it's just not fair that judge shut you down. She wasn't on that plane. You know, you just can't know what it was like unless you were there. Mom... you're absolutely right. I am? Your Honor, what the hell's going on here? She... she... she rearranged the jury box - and added space heaters. - Oh, and a stereo. Are you really gonna allow these theatrics? I am just setting the scene, like you told me to. I'll allow it. Let's get started. Ladies and gentlemen... you are all passengers on flight 82. It is three hours into your ordeal, and the air conditioner has long crapped out. So it's 84 degrees, and it is steadily getting warmer. The flight attendants aren't providing food or water, and you've been instructed not to use the lavatory. Oh, and, by the way, you are hearing this. Those three crying babies will soon be joined by two more. And that... that rotting stench... that's from a vomit bag in seat 41E. Oh, quiet. Quiet, everyone. That's the pilot. Greetings from the flight deck, ladies and gentlemen. We apologize for the delay and hope to have you in the air in a matter of minutes. Great. And in case you didn't know, he's lying. The real passengers of flight 82 were deposed in preparation for this trial, and I would like to read you a few of their statements. "The stench was so strong," "I tried to breathe only through my mouth." "I promised my little girl" "that we would never, ever fly again." "I felt helpless and scared," "and I didn't believe anything they told us." Actually, that last one was from an American hostage held in Iran, but it kind of fits, doesn't it? One final question. In front of you is a lever marked "emergency exit." If you pull it, you can escape. How many of you might pull that lever? You went to all this trouble for me. What trouble? You're my mom. Bingum. Bingum. - Hi. - Hi. I'll, uh, grab us some drinks. Sure. Can I borrow your daughter for a second? Take your time. I'm gonna put in a karaoke request. Grayson dropped the suit. It's over. That's great news. And thank you, Jane. - Janie, we're up next. - Okay. You are so lucky. My daughter refused to sing with me. Was she shy? No, she had a terrible voice. Bobbi... you're coming with us. Oh! All right, gals, come on. Oh, I love this song. You start. Hey, what's going on? - I want to show you something outside. - Okay. So, what's up? - Have to show you. - Okay. Oh, my God. Yeah, I know. If I'd won my suit, it wouldn't be there. That's amazing. She knew better than me, Jane. I tried to bully her into making changes to that contract, but... Ah, I wish she were here to say, "I told you so." Oh, well, would it help you if I said it? Yeah. Grayson, a girl doesn't just give her heart to anyone. You weren't bullying her. You were showing her, in your way, that you love her and that you wanted to protect her. Yeah, but she was too afraid to tell me she didn't want my help. She wasn't afraid. She didn't want to hurt your feelings. You know, it was her way of protecting you. You know, you're pretty amazing, Jane. Sync and corrected by atrn97g www.addic7ed.com
