 Uh... -Maybe your parents rolled into town? -They're in Dubai till end of the year. Maybe you pissed off the landlord. I am the landlord. The only other person who knows that stuff was here is your thief demon. She's not ours, she's her own demon. -But she was working for us. We paid her. -Yeah, in underpants. You're not dealing with a healthy psyche. [Lilith sighs] This looks like it could work.

 You brought me a contamination spell. I asked for a containment spell! I'm sorry, Grand Magus. I understand you're a transplant from our West Coast temple, but I assume they still teach people how to read in California? -Yes, Grand Magus. -Then find me a containment spell! This incantation could be used as a containment spell. The sacrifice requirements are kinda messy. Start the prep work, Miss Drake. You'll be leading this incantation. Actually, I don't think I should. Why not? My spell casting has been off-kilter lately. Anaplerosi. Anaplerosi.

 Miss Dupres! Start the preparations. You'll be leading this spell. Maybe there's some other way that I could help? I could use a salad. Find me those four acolytes. I could use some magic practitioners with a little extra right now. Right away, Grand Magus. Zecchia, we command you, appear before us. [in spooky voice] For fuck's sake, you again? And you added a demon trap? Not cool. -Thought you didn't use that word. -No, you can't use that word. -Thank you. -Where's our stuff? You mean, where's that stuff that passed through your possession briefly? Don't make us ask twice. Oh, sweet boy. You do not want to fuck with me. We just want our stuff back, please. Guys, the demon trap isn't working. [chuckles] It's working, you hairless chimp. The trap only tethers me to this dump, not that circle. So now, your slave, who was busy living her own damn life before you yanked her back here, is standing by to fix all of your mistakes till you say I can go. Woo-fucking-hoo. We did something wrong with the summoning. [chuckles] Ding, ding, ding. The guy who appreciates our differences wasn't present for the summoning, but was present for the assigning. So, contract... null... and... void. Oh, dear God, no. Please stop. Stop! Just... We'll get you to steal it all again. The party who acquired the artifacts from you did a fealty sacrifice that prevents me from stealing it again. So just tell us who they are, and we'll sort it out ourselves. Mm-mm. No can do. Demon-client confidentiality. [Randall] Again, not to say "I told you so," but I told you guys it was gonna go like this. [Zecchia gulps drink] Ah! Delish. Again. Whoa! Wait, hold up. Hold up. You give us something, then you get another drink. Fine. Don't ask for the same old thing, though. Try to be smart this time. We are so smart. You know, why don't we just ask for the weapons back? No way, we need it all back. That's how we get out of the Order. [Lilith] If we can't ask who, maybe we can ask where? Like, longitude, latitude? She'll still find a way to screw us over. No, she screwed us once, all right? But now we're ready. Nothing can go wrong this time. That doesn't look like our weapons, you idiots! You said you had the sickles. We did, all right? Well, we thought we did, but then... So you summoned a demon to help you find them? We summoned her to find out where she took them. A demon robbed you after you robbed the Order? No, more like she robbed the Order for us, then she double-crossed us. Oh, my God, how could you be so stupid? I don't know. Maybe I'm brain-damaged from the insane amount of pulvis memoriae you forced me to inhale. We're in the middle of a demon crisis, and you summoned a demon? I could take her. [chuckles] No, you couldn't. Uh, do you mind? We're in the middle of a private conversation here. Good to know. That thief demon is probably only a president. [Zecchia chuckles] I'm a baron, Miss Know-It-All. Which means you're a nothing burger. A baron demon can only manipulate things. An emperor manipulates people. Rogwan is an emperor demon. Rogwan is coming? I can't wait to see this. You guys are so fucked. [Zecchia continues laughing] [Alyssa] Tell them about Rogwan. Go ahead. Oh, look at it this way. I'm Rogwan, and this... is the Earth, and all the humans who infest it. Oh, you're killing me. Mm, no. You're killing you, and she'll kill him, and he'll kill himself, because that's how the Emperor of Fear rolls. -Demons kill people. Big deal. -[Zecchia and Alyssa] No, dummy. You humans are full of fear, and you think that it's some bad shit that you need to overcome, but fear is the gift that keeps humanity in check. Fear makes you pay attention so you stay alive. [snickers] Not for much longer. We need to get that shit back. No, you need to come to the temple. Vera's expecting you. If there's a chance we can get the sickles back, we must take it. My only choice is protect the Order or work with a demon? Think of it as protecting humanity. You okay with that? [sighs] I like humanity. Great. We'll go to the temple. Jack, Lilith, find the sickles. Jack. Don't fuck this up. Oh, man. If she's doing the swears, Rogwan must be bad. You have no idea. You want to get a head start on the apocalypse? We are not getting those sickles back. Whoever plundered my vault is long gone, so our only advantage lies in throwing Rogwan off balance. So you'll summon him out of the demon realm earlier than he expected, and he'll be, what? Be disoriented? -I'm just trying to understand. -Okay. We summon him into a demon trap. That's our first advantage. -He's an emperor demon. -Uh-huh. Which is why we then hit him with the Celtic paralysis spell, and then we add a Zoroastrian binding incantation to keep him locked inside of the temple. It's not ideal, but at least if he can't leave, then our grisly deaths won't be in vain. There's another option. The Excidium. Um, I thought that was an urban legend. -Mm. -If it's real, why don't I have access to it? Usually it's only the Grand Magus and Adeptus Superior who have it. But I made some good friends in Brazil-- I should have it! Well-- Say "Acting Grand Magus" one more time, I will make you my first sacrifice. Please. Excidium? It could easily destroy Rogwan. It could destroy several emperor demons. Along with the entire university and a good chunk of Norwich. And Rogwan would have to be inside the temple. It's a decision that can't be made by an acting-- It can't be your decision. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Would you like to summon the rest of the Gnostic Council and see if they're comfortable with you making that call? Like I said, I believe in you, Vera. I have the spell right here. You keep the Excidium on your phone? I have two passwords. [sighs] The elements you requested have arrived, Grand Magus. Oh, so you were going to go ahead with your plan, regardless of my opinion? We really have no other choice. Why is Rogwan so terrible? Losing your fears means losing your inhibitions, and that sounds amazing. Well, once you lose all of your fear, you have then lost the fear of dying. And then Rogwan owns you. Bring in the goats. Make sure the knives are sharp. Yes, Grand Magus. Nicky! Fetch the goats. But I thought... Juniper and Ivy? [Gabrielle] I told you not to name them. We'll call Rogwan early. We'll hit him with the paralysis and the binding spell. If those fail... we perform the Excidium. Hopefully we'll get lucky. Well, he's not Brazilian, he's a demon, so... [Zecchia] Can we get going? I have a life to attend to. Come on, we got to make sure we get this perfect. I told you I'm willing to forego the ritual. Just ask me what you want, and then I'll do it. What about your price? Hamish made me that delicious cocktail. We'll call it even. And your fealty sacrifice? I did eat all those cherries. [Jack] That covers payments. We're good to go. I hope so. Zecchia, retrace your steps backwards in time until we are satisfied. You're making me retrace my steps? Till we're satisfied. Don't forget about that part. Okay. Let's go. How does this work? Break apart our atoms and reconstitute them, or-- What is this? The last place I was before you resummoned me. A hidey-hole filled with magic artifacts. Happy? No, that doesn't answer my question. Where are we? Are we still in North America? [groans] You're getting good at this. You're 50 miles from Belgrave. So, am I done? Can I go live my life? -Looks good. -Contract fulfilled. [loud roaring sound] All right. Let's find the sickles and get back to the temple, and then we'll figure out the rest of this. I am so sorry, Juniper. Don't be. She's going to make amazing stew. Where are the other two? They were gone by the time I got there. Where did they go? They went to find the sickles. That was very thoughtful of them, but that's not what I asked for. There was nothing I could do. It's becoming a common refrain for you. You, over there. You, here with me. Miss Drake, why don't you circulate the water and lozenges? We're gonna be here for a while. It's time. Start the summoning. Emerge et praesta te nobis. Emerge et praesta te nobis. [Jack] Any luck? Not yet. Oh, I can't wait till we're finally out. I'm beginning to wonder if that'll ever happen. Once we help them beat Rogwan, we'll be as deep in it as we've ever been. Except we'll have the upper hand. Do you think what Randall said is right? That what happened to us in the fear corridor is actually a prophecy? Hey, if there's one thing that I learned from those insane necromancers, our fate is not set in stone. So... It's just, everyone you love dies. -Yeah, pretty much. -[sighs] I don't see these sickles anywhere. [clattering sound] [man] You made a big mistake breaking in. I know you're in here. I can feel your footsteps. Enchanted ground? That's a new one. Surrender now if you want to live. They always say that right before they kill you. Time to go. [loud rustling sound] [heavy footsteps] [low growl] [werewolf roars] [low growl] [all] Rogwan, emerge et praesta te nobis. Emerge et praesta te nobis. Emerge et praesta te nobis. [loud roaring sound] [Vera] Now! Go, now. [Gabrielle] Membra huius beluae obtorpescantur! [loud roaring sound] You summoned me early. No one's ever tried that before. Original. [Vera] Skull. Ad hunc locum planumque ligaris. [Rogwan] The binding spell? [chuckles] There's only one reason you'd be this desperate. Ad hunc locum planumque ligaris. [Rogwan in sing-song] ♪ You lost the sickles ♪ [people gasp] You did your best, Grand Magus. [loud thudding sound] -[Gabrielle] Grand Magus, no! -[girl] Oh, God. [Rogwan] But this has been a long time coming. [inhales deeply] Oh! Mm-mm-mm. So much fear. So many varieties. [woman gasps] [Rogwan] Fear of me. So dull. No, we can do better. We can do... better. Hmm. Fear of disappointment. No, no, wait. Fear of disappointing others. Oh, it's so strong in you. So strong. Let me help you with that. Mmm. Mmm. [snickers] Oh, that is delicious. I'm not afraid of you. That's the idea. [groans] Now if you'll excuse me, -I have a lot of work to do. -[shallow breathing] [loud roaring sound] [door shuts loudly] What does it feel like? [grunts] You tell me. [coughs] If I'm still alive, it means you failed to perform the Excidium. I didn't even have a chance to prepare it. He just walked right out of the temple. We'll have to lure him back. How? Just let the damned wolves out. They'll bring him back. You may go, Miss Drake. Of course. You bet. I hate your hair. [sighs] Prepare the Excidium. Print me a copy of the incantation. [exhales deeply] At once, Grand Magus. So what's all this talk about wolves? Yeah, I am so confused. Drop the act. This is not a regional theater, and you are not auditioning. You know? I suspected as soon as my vault was cleared out. You confirmed it as soon as Alyssa mentioned werewolves. Neither of you should ever play poker. If I wasn't so furious, I might even be a little impressed. Where is my inventory? -It was stolen from us. -[Vera sighs] I'm seriously considering killing both of you right now. Trust me, the feeling's mutual. -He's exaggerating. -Not at all. Fortunately for you, I'm a little more concerned with preventing the end of the world. Fortunately for you, I'm... Yeah. That we can agree on. Great. That's great. So, we will have to agree to replace your old lie with my new one. You are still... [snickers] loyal disciples with no memories of being the Knights of Saint Christopher. But as soon as you leave this room, I will have endowed you with astounding werewolf powers. So we get to be werewolves again? Mm-hmm. Yeah, to bring Rogwan back to the temple, it's our only chance. -We won't let you down. -Too late. You are so hot for teacher. It's an end of the world thing, buddy. You wouldn't understand. [screaming and shouting] [screaming and shouting continues] [sniffing] [continues sniffing] -[humming] -[man] Don't go to the window! [sniffs] Mmm. [sniffs deeply] -Mmm. -[helicopter approaching] Exams. Worry not. -[screaming] -Soon, your suffering will be over. Randall, third floor! -[Randall roars] -[objects clattering] -[yelps] -[thud] [Rogwan sighs] Werewolf! Well... This is new. Hmm. [sniffs] Oh. Centuries of terror. Being hunted, tortured, killed... [chuckles] It's astounding you're alive at all. [chuckles] I can't wait to see the havoc you create without any fear to stop you. [sniffing] [low groan] [roaring] You fools, don't you see? You're in danger! -This is fucked up. -[siren blares] I don't see any people around. Chad? Nailed it. [groans] Triple full twist. Film me next time, will you? [sirens blare] You shouldn't be walking on that ankle, man. You're not getting my spot, Morton. Holy shit! [distant noises] I guess Rogwan got through. [cell phone bleeps] On the bright side, Randall's alive. [people screaming] Guys. Hey, you guys got my text. [screams] We weren't sure if you guys were back yet. Guys, relax, it's just a dart in his eye. [Hamish groans] See? Healing already. I love being a werewolf. Hey. Shh. Shh. What, it's not a problem. Hey, I'm a werewolf. Congratulations. See? Doesn't scare, doesn't care. What did Rogwan do to you? He freed us. Did you know there are centuries of pent-up anguish inside our hides? Rogwan cleaned house like that! Better than therapy. He took your fear. Ate it, loved it, wouldn't shut up about how delicious it was. Apparently, werewolf fear is just... [blows kiss] You should get him to do you guys. -Fearlessness is amazing. -Oh. Also amazing, Vera knows we have our memories back. What! No one else is supposed to know, though. -Poor Vera. Still so fearful. -Mm. So how'd it go with Zecchia? -Uh... -We... We... We didn't get the sickles, but the four of us can go back. It's just right off Taverner Road. No, it was Rural Route 1. I saw the signs when we turned east. I thought it was west. -Uh... -Shit. Of course the place is protected by magic. [groans] Sounds like we're screwed. I know I'm supposed to be concerned for the fate of humanity, but... eh. Wait. I know what we should do. Jump off a bridge! Get out of my head! Not a good idea. [screaming] Guys, guys, help! -Shit! -I think I know what Vera's afraid of. [Lilith] What will do about Randall and Hamish? [Jack] They're the least of our worries. They'll heal. No, I won't be home for your Thanksgiving charity dinner. I'm tired of being second-class-citizened at that particular Vanity Fair photo op bullshit! And by the way, everyone knows you had your ass lifted. [man flicking lighter] -[explosion] -[man screams] That was the most glorious seven minutes of my life. Want to see if we can make it the second-best seven minutes? Uh... Um... I see you've met Rogwan. Nothing holds me back anymore. I'm free to do whatever I want. Okay, don't take all day. Oh, God, you're still so stupidly kissable. Thank you. But together we are a hot mess, okay? It's like... It's like a game of Fuck, Marry, Kill, and you're all three. But I will not allow you to compel me away from what I want for my life. And that's what? Grand Magus. How can you not remember that? Okay, Alyssa, is Vera still trying to stop Rogwan? She's got some Hail Mary idea that probably won't work. You know the first day I saw you, I wanted to kiss you? I did not. Um... Let's go to the temple. Come with us. It'll look good on your Grand Magus application. I can't help. My magic is totes fucked. Plus, I really wanna call my sister Jennica. Come to the temple with us. Yeah, yeah, fine. [explosion and loud noises] Jennica? Fuck you. We were nearly finished here, and then Vera told us to leave. You need to come with me. I'll be right behind you, okay? I promise. There's nothing you can do. You could give us a hand. Everything we tried failed in a matter of seconds. He's too strong. I seem to remember you telling me that I was a natural at this. I take it back. You're a terrible practitioner. You're the worst I've ever seen. Hey, you have nothing to worry about. I've already helped save the world once before this. This will be kids' stuff. Nobody's leaving unless the array is completed now. I'll catch up with you. You better. Mr. Morton. Grand Magus. You want to help. You've done enough already. [Jack] None of this would have happened if you had just stuck to our agreement. If you're only here to wallow in your victory, please leave. I have work to do. I thought it was hopeless. Well... doesn't mean you stop trying. Even if the price is too high. What is Kepler setting up in the temple, anyway? A bomb. Wha...? [scoffs] The temple is a bomb? Not by design. But magic is an energy. Just like any other energy, it can be absorbed, stored, stabilized, and... made to reach a critical mass. So this Excidium spell, it blocks the flow of magic, and then it blows. It's like a magic Chernobyl. Congratulations, Mr. Morton, you finally found an accurate analogy for magic. But if Rogwan's not at the epicenter, it still might not kill him. We have no choice. You're going to blow this place up even though it might not work? Definition of a Hail Mary. Maybe we could advertise a fear buffet and draw Rogwan back here. This isn't a joke. Lilith's right. I mean, Rogwan is drawn to fear. He can sense it, and he's almost fussy about it. Total snob. Worse than Edward. And the fear corridor amplifies our fears when we're going through it. Randall and Hamish said he loved werewolf fear. -Well, I give my life to the cause. -To the cause. Care to share with the group? We'll go into the fear corridor as werewolves, and we will stay there no matter what happens. Hopefully Rogwan gets the message, and then it draws him back here. [exhales deeply] I gotta to tell you, I never thought this is how I'd go out. On the bright side, as soon as he takes our fear, we won't be afraid to die. Yeah. Yeah, that makes this so much better. Vera says she's ready when you are. Um... Jack. Lilith. I just want to say that we're all going to die. -Figured that out already. -Will you shut up and let me finish? We're all going to die, and... [chuckles] I don't feel any fear, but... I still feel regret. Uh... Okay. You were my best friend... and I failed you when you needed me the most. And now I'll never get the chance to make it up to you, but I just... I just want to say that I'm really sorry. [sniffles] [exhales deeply] Jack. We're so not right for each other. I know. -But I don't care. -[distant explosion] I don't. And I hate how I ruined things between us. If we do... make it out of this, can I please take you to the mall? 'Cause I really hate your jean jacket. And your hair sucks. Yeah. Promise. We should go. [siren approaching] Uh... It's, uh... I guess it's good to get all the feels out of the way before you die. Yeah, I wish I had that chance with Pete. [exhales deeply] Well, it's been a slice, watching you go from vomiting noob to professional hit-wolf. I love you, too. I know. You did not just Han Solo me. [loud roaring noise] [growling] [approaching footsteps] Everything's in place. [distant explosions] Then go. If I fail here, you'll have a second shot at him, provided you can lure him to the DC temple. If it still exists after this. It feels wrong to go. [chuckles loudly] Please. I heard you arranging for your friend's helicopter -to pick you up in the concourse. -[groans] Take as many disciples as you can. Shotgun. This could work, Magus. Grand Magus. [sighs] Rats in a sinking ship, huh? You're a good Grand Magus. I would have been a great Grand Magus. You showed some promise. Please. You consider me your protégé. I don't play favorites. You did with Jack. Yes. Well... I guess we're both guilty of that. Well, my magic sucks, but I've got nowhere else to be, if you want some company. Flip the pages. [Rogwan] Fear of insignificance. [chuckles] I mean, look at you. It's reality. -You have no idea. -Hmm. -Everything's about to change. -[snickers] Not the way you're planning. -[chuckles] -Hmm. Werewolf. [cackles] [growls] [loud, metallic droning] [distant animal-like howling] What the hell? Lilith. Lilith. I'm here. -[exhales deeply] -What the hell was that place? Rogwan's apocalypse? Seemed more like a vision of the future where the Knights had failed, and the Order destroyed the planet. We both saw the same thing. That must be the Knights' greatest fear. We've really dropped the ball on our training. Big time. But... this can't be the real vault. We know that the vault is empty. I think we're still inside of the corridor. This is someone else's fear. But then shouldn't we be wolves? -Werewolves are scary. -[roaring sound] Maybe to mortals. Personally, I find you quite exquisite. We're here because he's shit scared of us. [Rogwan] I don't have fear. I am fear! [Jack screams] Redi ad ista inferna in quorum genituses! That's impossible. None of this is real. If your fear is real, these are real. Jack! The wall! I'm working on it! [Jack grunts loudly] Lilith! [grunts] [groans] Jack. Let me go. No! Hang on! Help! Someone help! [in cartoonish voice] Methinks I see thee now. Thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. Nothing lower than that. Either my eyesight fails, or thou lookest... pale... Pale! Pale! Get off! [breathing rapidly] Hold on. Randall, no, no! -You're scared again! -No! No! [receding footsteps] Rogwan must be gone. Et pestem usque ad cineres ardeat. Grand Magus, before we die, I want to apologize for calling you a bitch. -[loud growing noise] -Your fear is back. Your fear is back! Hanc magiam relinquo! Carmen finiatur! -[noise recedes] -Rogwan's gone! -Hamish's chickenshit again! -We know. [Randall] What did you do? It was Jack and Lilith. They beat him somehow. Jack. Where's Lilith? [Gabrielle] The word "hero" is overused, but in this case, I'll accept it. [laughter] -Listen, let's get a head start. -[rock music playing] No. Come on. It's tradition. No matter what happens, we salute the fallen. Long the road, short the life. When she's dead. Jack said she was still alive when Rogwan dragged her into Hell. Wow. Actually, Hell is Judeo-Christian propaganda designed for deterrence. You can think of it more as a transdimensional realm. Whatever. Until I see Timber's hide in a locker... which isn't going to happen. Okay. Until we know. Who else knows? That we broke into your precious vault, and that we have our memories back? Just watch your tone, disciple. No one else knows, Vera. You'll forgive me if I don't believe you. Then go get your fucking glove of truth and use it on me. I doubt it would have any real effect on you, and it was stolen. Why would you do something so stupid? We wanted to hit the Order where it would hurt. We wanted you to pay for stealing our memories. You wanted revenge. Wouldn't you? Was it really so bad... having all of the pain of your past just gone? So erasing our lives is a kindness in your world? -Yes. -[scoffs] All right, well, what now? Well, as much as I would love to... I can't punish you. If anybody else finds out that you engineered the theft, and that you have your memories back, you'd be killed. So would I, if I was lucky. So it's mutually assured destruction? You haven't left me much choice. What about Lilith? [Vera] Given your penchant for ignoring my orders, maybe you'll listen to a warning. Any effort to enter the demon realm is suicide. There has to be a way. If it's any consolation... I couldn't think of anyone better suited to survive the demon realm than Lilith. There is a way, isn't there? Even if there was... it's gone now. [faint roaring sound] "In accordance with the rules, the Esoteric Sons of Prometheus formally demand an audience with the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose and hereby invoke parlay." You can read Enochian? Silverback can. What does it mean? What does "parlay" mean? It means... I knew who was behind all of this... and they think we should have a visit.
