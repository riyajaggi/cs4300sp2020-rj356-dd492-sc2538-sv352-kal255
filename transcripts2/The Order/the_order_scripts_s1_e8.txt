 What happened? - Does The Order have him? - No, but they're after us - and they want blood. - We need ideas. Actually, I think I might have one. Hi. - Oh, hell, no. - You must be joking. She shouldn't be here. You got a problem, witchy-poo? I... I didn't expect to see a woman here. It's the 21st century. - Women can be werewolves. - Yeah, I know.

 It's just... Nothing. Sorry. She's here to help. She's in The Order. Why should we trust her? - She's in the room. - Why should we trust you? Because I just endured torture instead of ratting you out. - Your own people tortured you? - It's complicated. - They thought she was a werewolf. - That's not that complicated. - She shouldn't be here. - She can help us find Randall. I know this divining spell. It's like a magic compass. - Do it. - What? You can't be serious. I'm always serious.

 What if she needs the cerebral fluid from an unborn baby? - Have you got some? - What? Note to self, werewolves are humorless. Where's your magic go-bag? I don't have a “magic go-bag.” I have a kit. I'm gonna need something that's uniquely Randall's. That's good. Inveniatur... Randall Carpio. Where's the ringing? Maybe the spell didn't work. It's working. - What do you mean, ringing? - It's like a magical alert for us. Maybe there's no ringing because she's helping us, so the magic's good. Shut up. Hey! How can you be so bad at secret societies? You're in two of them! Hello, Mr. Carpio. My name is Dr. Hemmings. Are you gonna tell me where I am? My research facility. You signed up for my study last night. So, you're the warden? This isn't a prison. The test is voluntary. You and your friend thought it would be hilarious. Then, I can leave. Uh, of course you can. It's funny, door's locked. Oh, dear. Not again. Maintenance was supposed to fix that last week. Marty, make a note. I apologize for that, but given your inebriated state, it was probably for the best. Where's the exit? Of course, you waive the 50 dollar honorarium. I'll survive. Where's Ruby? She's already started the protocol. I guess she couldn't survive. I want to see her. Then you can participate or wait outside. Your choice. Or are you afraid of needles? Let's do it. Excellent. Marty? - You won't feel a thing. - What kind of test is this? I'm developing an implant that enhances physical performance. Shall we? Leave it open. Where are you going? The door's right there. The compass says this way. - This is a total waste of our time. - Do you have a better idea? We track down the girl that Randall was sniffing around last night and beat the crap out of her until she tells us what we want to know. I said better idea. Sorry about Lilith. She's nice, once you get to know her. I'm told. Don't worry, you get used to it. Why do you sound like the voice of experience? Uh, we had a couple of freshman classes together. I doubt she remembers me. Up there. That's where your magic salad dressing wants to go? Hey, whoa, whoa. You can't just walk in there. - Sure I can. - That's not how we do things. It's how we do things. What's she doing? And spoil the surprise? This is a restricted area. Now what? A small subcutaneous surgical procedure. Uh, nothing to worry about. Marty will give you a general anesthetic. Ow! What the hell, Marty? I'm sorry. It should've knocked him out. I got a kick-ass metabolism. Ah! There we go. Let's get him into surgery. Dad, I need a ride to fencing! Dad? Whoa! Magic's so cool. Maddox, put that down. Uh-oh. Don't! Dad? Get the hell away from my son. You try anything, I kill him. Cast a spell... - I kill him. - Dad? It's okay, buddy. It's okay. Stay calm. - It's like a morgue in here. - That's an encouraging thought. I'm just saying it's going to be easy. Randall's definitely in here. If you hadn't murdered the security guard, maybe we'd have the passcode. I didn't kill him. He's got a concussion. - Maybe a little brain damage. - Just find Randall and get out of here. This door is actually pretty tough. Let me do it. You'd just end up alerting security to our presence. You thinking Reseretur? Mm. Aperiatur would be better. Or we could try abraca-door-a. Come on. Aperiatur. Okay, that's pretty cool. What? It is. Look, whatever you want, I can get it. - But you have to release my son. - You're not in charge here. He can't help you. Let him go. Take me. I let him go, you betray me. We'll perform a mirror incantation. Whatever happens to you, happens to me. You try anything, I rip his trachea out. Ligemur. - Dad! - It's okay, bud. Listen, go next door to the Sandwells. Pretend like nothing happened, understand? - Come with me. - It's okay. I'll be fine. Go. Go. Now that our lives are entwined, do you mind telling me your name? Jurgen Sawyer. I see you found my book. This was the first spell we learned. - Why would I care? - Right. Why would you? She's trying to help... Oh, crap. Sorry. We don't need magic. That's a lot of ground to cover. Okay. Me and Alyssa, Jack and Lilith, that way both groups have Knight and Order powers. Try again. No! - That's probably not the best idea. - Do not kill her. - I won't. - No promises! It's never going to work, you know? You and Alyssa. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Don't take it personally. It's not you. Well, it's not her. I can't imagine being in a relationship with someone on the opposite side. It's hard enough being in one with another Knight. You and Lilith? Or Randall? No. And he wishes. Her name was Cassie. Classic love story. Boy meets girl. Girl turns out to be a werewolf. Boy agrees to follow girl anywhere, and girl ends up dead. - I'm sorry, Hamish. - Don't be. Cassie loved being a Knight. She was totally committed to the cause. What about you? I swore an oath. If you could leave, if there was a way to get out, would you take it? Would you? Hey, assholes! Get out of here! Is that the guy we fought at the Blade & Chalice? - Have you seen our friend? - Yeah! They're doing shit to him! They've done shit to all of us. What kind of shit? They do... They do something and it makes us change. - What do they do? - Ow. Hang on! We'll get you out of here. - What the hell's this place built out of? - Holy shit! - That looks familiar. - We gotta find Randall. Fuck. How are you feeling? Like shit. Where's Ruby? You'll see her soon. On a scale of one to ten, how much pain do you feel? I don't know. A one. You told me I'd see her. And you will, as soon as you complete your trial. Well, he certainly developed an attraction for you. That's what makes my job so easy. The implant's been in place for quite a while. One hour, fifteen minutes. That's odd. Usually we'd have seen physical evidence of transformation by now. Maybe he has a natural resistance to it. Or... you made an error during the incantation. Or he has a natural inhibitor that blocks transformations. We've been over this, Miss Speers. There is no natural resistance to transformation magic. Or any magic. Okay. Well, then, he's just been a giant step backwards then, hasn't he? I mean, you want to make werewolves, right? Well, now we actually have one and you can't get him to transform. So, maybe this saevbacch sigil isn't the best way to create a monster. More likely, the sigil you implanted was compromised. I triple checked it. The only variable here is Randall, the subject. We're not going to have an issue like we did last time, are we? I told you, last time was a security breach. I have no idea how that other subject escaped. Expose the subject to an attack scenario. Maybe heightened adrenaline will trigger his change. Marty? Send in a reject. Hey! Last chance to let me out! Holy shit! Dude, you okay? Oh, fuck! Dude! Whoa! Come on! Come on! Stop! I said stop! - What just happened? - Elevated heart rate, increased respiration, body temperature soared. It's like he started his transformation and then it just stopped. That's impossible. Once they start to transform, they can't stop. Apparently, it's not impossible. Maybe he's using a different kind of magic, one you've never seen before. Send in another reject. Marty, we're going again. They find him? He just asked the same thing. How's your archaeology program? I dropped that, like, a year ago. How did you know I was interested in archaeology? You must have mentioned it when we were in freshmen year. We never took a class together. You know, those lecture halls are so big and full of students. It's hard to keep track of everyone, you know? Yeah, I do. I also know that we never took a class together. We need to keep looking for your friend. That's another thing. Why are you so hell-bent on helping us? You're mad at your boyfriend. He is not my boyfriend. You don't know Randall or Hamish, and you sure as shit don't know me. You know, maybe I'm just a nice person, Lily-Bell. The only person to call me Lily-Bell was my grandmother. You want to tell me where you heard that? Not really. Do you want me to disembowel you right here in this creepy science lab? Not really. You love cotton candy, but only if it's from a carnival. Your mom used to pinch you on the cheeks when you were bad. You had a pet rabbit, and when you were ten, you found it frozen stiff after a cold night, and you never let yourself have another pet. You almost had me. How did you do that? You do some kind of magical memory scan? Did you knock me out and get me to tell you all of that? I know that because we used to be in The Order together. I've been trapped inside that book... for 70 years. Then you'll want to be on your way. Mm. - It's not complete. - I'm aware. That's why I've been so weak. The missing piece. Perhaps you'd like to help me find it. You'll probably never finish. Always one step behind. You covet the Vade Maecum... but what do you actually know about it? It's the most powerful incantation ever created. It grants its practitioner unlimited power. Wrong. The Vade Maecum doesn't grant power. It is power. And it's not an incantation. It's a contract. Which you obviously failed to uphold. I was this close to finishing... before I was betrayed. By who? It's "whom." And they call themselves The Knights of Saint Christopher. Really? Self-righteous zealots. They hate the Vade Maecum. They'd destroy it if they could. They could never fully grasp the book's potential. The Knights of Saint Christopher. They're werewolves, aren't they? They are. And how did they trap you inside the book? Oh, please, that wasn't them. That was blind luck. To finish the Vade Maecum... you must become one with the book. When they tore the book apart, they tore me apart. So, the book requires a cleansing. If we can transfer my essence into another vessel, the book will be cleansed. And I'll be free. And, of course, you won't betray me... when you get that new body. We're bound together now, aren't we? Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't have the wherewithal to make another attempt for a long time. You free me and the book is yours. I don't know a possession magic. Provide me with a body... Hm. I'll talk you through it. - We found the gold coins together. - Bullshit! We were promoted to Medicum at the same time. - Bullshit! - Everything okay, ladies? - We're fine! - Fine! Let's just find Randall and get the fuck out of here. - Be careful. - Yeah, you, too. Are you sure you're okay? - I still outrank you, you know. - Mm-hmm. I already searched down there. Yeah. I know. Stop! Please, stop! I don't want to do this anymore. Four times. Four interrupted transformations. How is he controlling them? Can you rate your anger on a scale of one to ten? Fuck you! How about that? Fascinating. Even with increased aggression, the subject is able to repress any full-scale transformation. He should be a monster by now. Maybe he studies yoga. We need to push him to his limit. Find something that will push him over the edge. Yeah, good luck. Marty, can you come in here, please? Oh, come on! Ah. Ruby? Ruby. Thank God, you're okay. - Look, Randall... - You're okay. But don't look at them. They didn't hurt you? They didn't do anything to you? No, I'm fine. Let me see the back of your neck. Okay, great. That's great. Listen to me. Look at me. We're going to be okay. We're going to get out of here, I promise. Now... Do you see any exits? Do you know any people who work here? I don't know. I don't know. Okay, that's okay. That's okay. Ruby, don't be shy. She knows everything about this place, Mr. Carpio. She's my assistant. That... No, that... that doesn't make any sense. Ruby is the reason you're here. He's lying. Right? I'm sorry. All of those people who are dead... Shut up! - All of those people you've killed. - Shut up! Try to breathe, just calm down. Just try to breathe. Oh, jeez. Imagine an army of these under our control. No one will dare challenge the Grand Magus. Secure the subject and collect samples. Lilith was in The Order? Why is that so hard to believe? Have you met Lilith? I mean, of course you have, but she just hates magic so much. I can't picture her wanting to have anything to do with them. She was good, really good. - Why'd she get bounced? - That's actually none of your business. I am still a member of The Order. You weren't then. So, what? I'm not authorized to know the history? Not yet, Acolyte. Were you the one that powdered her memory? Is that why you let me off? You know it's not all about you, right? Dude, you are not gonna believe what just happened to Ruby. Yeah. - You guys aren't supposed to be here. - Well... uh... - You are quick with that stuff. - Not quick enough sometimes. So, you regret it. Can we just find Randall? Aperiatur. It must be the werewolf in you that makes spells stronger. Too bad the Knights don't like when I use magic. From my experience, it's other practitioners they hate. Depends on how they're using it. - There's nothing in here. - Hang on. That's not good. We gotta find that room. I was hoping for someone who actually shaves. This was the best I could do on such short notice. This will do. You have your new body. Now, release your claim to the book. It was done the moment you gave me this body. And our binding spell. I think not. My last body failed, but this body won't. Thank you for this second chance. Ah, ah, ah, ah! Remember the mirror incantation. You hurt me, you're only hurting yourself. Exactly. Sanetur! Reparetur! Restituatur! See? Here's the thing about a mirror incantation. It only mimics the injuries. It doesn't guarantee certain death. You never should have threatened my son. You killed yourself... ...for petty revenge? All I have to do is outlive you. Aperiatur. Randall? Hey. - Hey, I know you. - Come on, buddy. We got to get you out of here. What the hell did they do to you? And I know you. Oh, you guys worked things out. So great. It's a work in progress, buddy. Come on, let's go. Oh, no. No, Ruby, no. - Come on, we gotta get out of here. - No. They're all dead because of me! Where are you going? To find Dr. Asshole. You want everything the Vade Maecum offers... but you'll never be able to pay the price. You can die thinking that. You will never be able to sacrifice your son. Ah! Sanetur! What the hell? Magus? Magus? What happened? You saved my life, kid. That's what happened. Help me clean up this mess, and I'll buy you an island. Aperiatur. This is a saevbacch sigil. It amplifies a person's anger. The berserkers would tattoo it on the back of their necks before going into battle. This incantation increases your strength for short periods of time. If I'm reading this right, this potion creates an insatiable hunger. He's mixing magic. Why? To create monsters. Magus, it's Hemmings. Give me a call me as soon as you get this. I think I've come up with a solution to your werewolf problem. He'll call you back. Mr. Carpio, you shouldn't be here. Guys, can I have a minute? Patient doctor privilege. Medicum, Acolyte, protect me. I gave you an order! You asshole. Don't do that again. Missed you, too, Lil. - Everyone, back to the Den. - Even her? Especially her. I could destroy you with a snap of my fingers. She can't. Not yet. You know as well as I do, we need to talk about this. We can't just leave that mess back there. Inflammetur. Try it. Just visualize where you want the fire. Inflammetur. No, thanks. - You never pass up an après-kill drink. - I'm not in the mood. Après-kill? You have your traditions, we have ours. Yeah, we have après-kill, and you kill innocent people. That was an Order-backed operation? Doing a bang-up job with your undercover work there, buddy. - I have never even seen that guy before. - No one's blaming you, Jack. Hemmings went rogue. It's the only explanation. Of course! Because The Order isn't inherently evil. - My order would never sanction that. - Right. They only torture people in a fun way. So, now torture bothers you? What's that supposed to mean? You're not the least bit curious as to why you were kicked out? Wait, you two know each other? Lilith was in The Order. Is that true? Hey! Is that true? Are you one of them? Them? - Randall, just dial it down a notch. - If it wasn't for us, you'd be another one of their fucking drones. I thought they were trying to make a difference, do something good. - We are! - I never should've made you a knight. - No, you probably shouldn't have. - Can we focus? You murdered a high-ranking member tonight. \They're going to be coming for you. Can we just kill her and get it over with already? Is that your answer for everything? - Yes. - No one is killing anyone else tonight. - Hey, how about you let me call the shots? - Can you make a decision - without resorting to beer pong? - I'm not resorting. - No, you're an alcoholic. - I'm an alcohol aficionado. - I'm leaving. - You're not going anywhere. You really want to do this? Oh, I want to do this. Edward Coventry is my father! You didn't think to tell us that your father... is the leader of The fucking Order? - That's none of your business. - I trusted you, man! - You betrayed me. - I betrayed you? You turned me into a fucking werewolf! - That mistake I can fix right now! - Randall, I think whatever Hemmings did to you is still affecting you. You know what they did to me? They opened my eyes to your fucking bullshit. Randall. Shit! Randall! - A little help? - What the hell did Hemmings do to him? The saevbacch sigil. It's amplifying his rage. We need to get it out of him before he loses control! Keep him still. Sorry about dropping that whole Order thing on you. How can you stay with them, knowing what they're capable of? Same way you rationalize murdering people. Maybe it's stupid, but it's the first place I felt like I could just be who I am. Are you guys seriously talking about your feelings right now? We're multitasking! Now would be the time to hurry up! Oh, shit. Did I lose at beer pong again? Dad! - In here, buddy. - Dad! Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Did he hurt you? - Not as bad as I hurt him. - Good. There's something that I need to talk to you about. lt's really important. I'll never touch anything in your office ever again. Good. It's not that. It's going to sound a little scary, but after today, I think you can handle it. What do you want me to do? I want you to help me... change the world. Was I good at it? You saved me the first year. I kept messing up spells. I couldn't cut my hand without fainting. The Temple Magus hated me. - But you stuck with me. - Why'd I get kicked out? You know how tragedy plus time equals comedy? - It's not comedy yet. - Not yet. But I could tell you when it is. No. I'm good. I think I'm where I'm supposed to be, anyhow. Hey. What's your boss up to? Edward Coventry isn't the bad guy. Make sure it stays that way and we'll be fine. Hey, guys. Sorry I tried to kill all of you. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Coventry. I'm not sorry about anything, but you're both a couple of assholes. Sorry I called you both assholes. Did you punch me in the face? Me? I would never. Huh. Well, this has been, uh... hell. But I've gotta to go. I'm not stopping you. And you thought I was going to kill her. Oh, I'll walk you home. Ah, I'm ready for that gimlet now. Make that two. On it. Did you punch me in the face? You wish. I thought it was vampires that need to be invited in. You want me to come in? I wanted you to pick a side... but I think you already have. - Alyssa... - It's okay. You've got a bond with them that The Order will never give you. I understand that. It's not just about what I have with them. Hemmings is one person. - He isn't The Order. - I know. I have seen the good side, too. It isn't enough though, is it? Not with the whole... "Edward is your dad" thing. I should have told you sooner. Why haven't you told him? Tell him what? That he magicked some girl and forgot about her? That she never got over it? That she killed herself because of him? Or that I've spent my whole life hating him? I'm sorry that that happened to her. And to you. But if we can't forgive, how can we hope to move on? - Could you get past it? - I would like to think that I would try. Just like I'm trying to believe that you didn't want to lie to me. I can't. I'm sorry. We're on opposite sides. Maybe we don't have to be. Maybe we always were. I'd better go... before I try and kiss you again. Yeah. You're an idiot, Jack. I'm so glad that you... Come with me. We have work to do.
