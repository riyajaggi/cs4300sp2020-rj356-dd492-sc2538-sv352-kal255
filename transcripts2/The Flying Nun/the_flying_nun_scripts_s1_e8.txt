 The Flying Nun (1967–1970): Season 1, Episode 8 - Ah Love, Could You and I Conspire? - full transcript 
 Bobbye Starr is trying to get away from her mobster boyfriend Al Caine, who she wants to get a legitimate job and ask her to marry him. In her getaway, she stows away in the convent's station wagon and isn't discovered by the sisters until they reach the convent. Sisters Bertrille and Jacqueline think that Bobbye's arrival is timely, as she mentioned her job was as a 'private secretary' and the Reverend Mother probably needs help while her regular secretary, Sister Ana, is off sick. However regular secretarial work is not Bobbye's strength in life. Despite her secretarial failings, she endears herself to everyone at the convent and is allowed to stay as long as she feels she needs. Although Bobbye resigns herself to go back to Al, Sister Bertrille suggests that to nab Al, Bobbye needs to make him jealous. The sister suggests Carlos as the perfect pretend suitor. Carlos agrees after he lays eyes on the glamorous Bobbye. They make it as obvious to Al as possible, and it isn't until after the sisters tell Al about Carlos and Bobbye's whereabouts that the sisters discover Al's shady background. Sister Bertrille flies off to warn Carlos and Bobbye of Al's impending arrival. However Al arrives before her and threatens Bobbye and Carlos with a gun in hand. Sister Bertrille calls in the police, and with the siren wailing, Al is placed in a position of either having Bobbye testify against him, or marry him. He reluctantly concedes to the latter.
