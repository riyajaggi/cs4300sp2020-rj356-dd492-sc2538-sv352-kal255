 The Flying Nun (1967–1970): Season 1, Episode 1 - The Flying Nun - full transcript 
 Located atop a hill in old San Juan, Puerto Rico, the Convent San Tanco is populated by among others the stern and traditional Reverend Mother Superior Plaseato, straightforward Sister Jacqueline, English challenged Sister Sixto who is always mixing her English slang around, young innocent novice Sister Ana, Sister Teresa and Sister Marguerita. The convent is an old, beautiful building but is showing its age and is need of major repairs - as is everything the sister's own - money for which the sisters do not have. Into their world enters Sister Bertrille, a new novice from New York, who is to teach kindergarten. Sister Bertrille is an ex-surfer girl hippie with tons of enthusiasm who will go to any means to achieve what she wants and what she thinks the convent needs. This includes striking up a friendship with local entrepreneur and playboy, Carlos Ramirez, the owner of the Carlos A-Go Go Discotheque and Casino in San Juan. Carlos own a piece of property that would be perfect for a new school for the convent, and Sister Bertrille thinks it would be perfect for Carlos to donate it to the convent. This approach goes against the wishes of the Reverend Mother, who considers it undignified and uncouth. Above all of this, Sister Bertrille discovers that the strong winds of San Juan coupled with the wing-like coronet of the nun's habit can make her go airborne. She quickly learns how to fly by raising and turning her head and the associated coronet. Among those that see her fly is Carlos, who thinks he has seen a vision and as such, decides to donate his property to the convent and the sisters. But those that do not see her fly are the men of the restricted military base into which she accidentally flies. It takes some convincing for them to believe she's not a spy. But the person who may need even more convincing is the Reverend Mother, who must decide what to do with her new flying novice.

 FOR SISTER BERTRILLE'S ARRIVAL. SHE CAME BURSTING OFF THE BOAT IN HIGH SPIRITS, AND A HIGH WIND. NOW, THE REASON I KEEP MENTIONING THE WIND, IS THAT IT'S AS IMPORTANT TO OUR STORY AS IT WAS TO THE WRIGHT BROTHERS. YOU SEE, ONE OF THE MANY THINGS WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT SISTER BERTRILLE WAS THAT SHE ONLY WEIGHED 90 POUNDS. DRIPPING WET! FORTUNATELY, THROUGH THE GRACE OF GOD, AND THE AUSTRALIAN CRAWL, SHE MANAGED TO SAVE HERSELF. NOW LOOK, ST. THOMAS IS ONLY 45 MINUTES AWAY. WE'LL BE THERE FRIDAY AND BE BACK ON SUNDAY NIGHT. YOUR FATHER WILL NEVER KNOW. I DON'T KNOW, CARLOS. JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. NOW, DO I SEEM THE SORT OF MAN WHO WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A GIRL? TRUST ME, CONSUELA. WELL, MAYBE I'LL GO. IF YOU PROMISE NOT TO... WHAT IS IT NOW? THERE'S A NUN ON THE BACK OF YOUR BOAT. THERE'S A WHAT? HI. WHO ARE YOU? OH, I'M SISTER BERTRILLE. I JUST ARRIVED FROM THE UNTIED STATES. YOU SWAM ALL THE WAY? GIN. HELLO THERE. HELLO. I FELL OFF THE DOCK. SORRY TO BREAK UP THE GAME, GIRLS, BUT I HAVE TO GET TO THE CONVENT. SEE YOU ON SUNDAY AT MASS. IT'S A DEAL, SISTER. WHAT... WHAT... WHAT... WHAT ABOUT SUNDAY? WHAT ABOUT ST. THOMAS? THE SISTER BLITZED US. WE AGREED IF WE LOST, WE WOULD ATTEND MASS FOR 3 SUNDAYS. OH, PEDRO, WILL YOU TAKE THE SISTER ASHORE? THANK YOU FOR THE HOSPITALITY, SENOR RAMIREZ. I'LL SAY A PRAYER FOR YOU. OH, DON'T BOTHER. I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS MAN. WELL, ALL THE MORE REASON I SHOULD SAY A PRAYER FOR YOU. THANK YOU. SISTER BERTRILLE. YES. OH, I'M SISTER JACQUELINE. WELL, OH, YOU SPEAK ENGLISH. WELL, I'M FROM BOSTON. IT GOES WITH THE TERRITORY. UH, THIS IS SISTER SIXTO. SISTER SIXTO IS FROM PUERTO RICO. OH, UH, HOW DO YOU DO, SISTER? VERY NICE TO MEET YOU, SISTER SIXTO. YOU ARE A LITTLE WET BEHIND THE EARS. WELL, I-I'M JUST A NOVICE. SISTER SIXTO IS STUDYING THE DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN SLANG. SHE MEANS YOU'RE A LITTLE DAMP AROUND THE EDGES. OH, YEAH, AND IN THE MIDDLE, TOO. UH, WHERE ARE YOUR BAGS? OVER HERE. OH. SENOR RAMIREZ WAS SO NICE TO ME. DID YOU KNOW ALL THOSE GIRLS WORK FOR HIM IN HIS DISCOTHEQUE? HE PUTS 'EM IN CAGES. I DON'T DOUBT IT. HIS REPUTATION IS NOT EXACTLY FLAWLESS. UH, YOU PLAY CARDS OFTEN, SISTER BERTRILLE? NO, I JUST LEARNED ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO. HELPED PASS THE TIME WHILE I WAS IN JAIL. PRISON? YEAH, I WAS ARRESTED AT A FREE SPEECH PROTEST RALLY. IT WAS AT THIS POINT I HAD THE FEELING THE CONVENT SAN TANCO WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. THAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE BIGGEST UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR! OH, IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL. THE PLUMBING, SHE'S ON THE BLANK. BLINK, SISTER. SO IS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE CONVENT, I'M AFRAID. BUT IT LOOKS SO WELL PRESERVED. WELL, SOMEONE WILLED A FUND TO KEEP UP THE ACTUAL BUILDING. BUT, UH, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT DOESN'T COVER THE COST OF NEW CLASSROOMS OR MODERN PLUMBING. I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE TO CHANGE. WHAT IS IT, SISTER BERTRILLE? SOMEHOW I HAVE THE FEELING OF... OF COMING HOME. THANK GOODNESS THE WIND HAS DIED DOWN. IT SEEMS TO BLOW IN GUSTS. OH, LOOK AT THE SEAGULLS. AREN'T THEY PRETTY? WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I OFTEN WISHED I WERE A BIRD. THEY SEEM SO FREE AND GRACEFUL. AND YOU WEREN'T. I WAS THE KLUTZ OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. FELL OUT OF A TREE HOUSE 9 TIMES IN THE 4TH GRADE ALONE. NO WONDER YOU WISHED YOU WERE A BIRD. AND YOU ALMOST GOT YOUR WISH. SOME PEOPLE THINK OUR CORNETS MAKE US LOOK LIKE BIRDS. I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE IN A WAY. UH, UH, SISTER! GOOD GRIEF! OH, HAVE... HAVE FAITH, SISTER, DON'T PANIC, HAVE FAITH. I'LL, UH, I... I... I-I'LL GET YOU DOWN SOMEHOW. OH, DEAR. DON'T MOVE. I'VE ALMOST GOT YOU. STRETCH OUT YOUR FOOT. NO, NOT THAT ONE. TRY AND GET YOUR OTHER FOOT DOWN. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? SISTER JACQUELINE, WHILE I... WHILE I WAS UP THERE, I HAD THE STRANGEST FEELING. IF I REALLY WANTED TO, I... I COULD'VE FLOWN. WHERE IS OUR NEW LITTLE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THIS MORNING? I DON'T KNOW. SHE CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS BREAKFAST. NOW, SISTER BERTRILLE IS AS THIN AS A ROOK. THIN AS A RAKE, SISTER. GOOD MORNING, SISTER. SORRY I'M LATE. I WENT TO THE LIBRARY TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHY I BECAME AIRBORNE LAST NIGHT. AIRBORNE? YES, I HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH THE WIND. THE WIND? SISTER BERTRILLE ONLY WEIGHS 90 POUNDS AND SOMETIMES, UH, THE WIND LIFTS HER. LIFTS HER WHERE? UH, UP. BUT IT'S OK, I... I FIGURED IT ALL OUT. IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH MY CORNET. THE CORNET? YES, YOU SEE, WHEN LIFT PLUS THRUST IS GREATER THAN LOAD PLUS DRAG, WELL, ANYTHING WILL FLY. YOU ARE VERY SMALL, SISTER BERTRILLE. PERHAPS IT MIGHT HELP IF YOU HAD MORE STARCH IN YOUR DIET. OR LESS IN YOUR CORNET. I'M ANXIOUS TO MEET THE REVEREND MOTHER. WHEN WILL SHE BE BACK? IN A FEW DAYS. WHAT'S SHE LIKE? OH, WELL, OF COURSE, UH, THE REVEREND MOTHER IS OLDER. OH. UM, SISTER BERTRILLE, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THE REVEREND MOTHER ENTERED THE ORDER, PERFECTION WAS REACHED BY DISCIPLINE. DISCIPLINE WHICH DESTROYED ALL TRACES OF SELF-WILL OR OR REBELLIOUSNESS. AT LEAST THAT WAS THE IDEA. I SUPPOSE WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT HER IDEAS ARE RATHER TRADITIONAL. OH, BUT SISTER, TIMES ARE CHANGING SO FAST. I KNOW. AND THE REVEREND MOTHER TRIES VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND, BUT, BUT FOR HER SOMETIMES IT'S... IT'S DIFFICULT. WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE, SISTER, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY. I'M SURE THE REVEREND MOTHER AND I WILL GET ALONG JUST FINE. YOU THINK SO? OF COURSE. WE YOUNG SISTERS MAY APPROACH THINGS DIFFERENTLY, BUT OUR AIMS ARE STILL THE SAME. OH, THIS IS SISTER ANA. SHE'LL TAKE YOU TO YOUR KINDERGARTEN CLASS. HI. WELL, LEAD ON, SISTER ANA. SISTER, WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER YOU HAD THE ABILITY? ABILITY? TO... YOU KNOW. OH, OH, THAT. JUST YESTERDAY, BUT IT'S NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT. IT'S ALL A QUESTION OF AERODYNAMICS. SISTER? MANY, VERY HOLY PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE THEY ARE HOLY BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HUMBLE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SOME OF THE, THE SAINTS. SAINTS? CHILDREN, THIS IS SISTER BERTRILLE, WHO HAS COME ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICAN TO TEACH YOU. SHE IS A VERY SPECIAL PERSON. OH, WELL, HI, KIDS. BUENOS DIAS, HERMANA. OH, UH, BUENOS DIAS, NINOS. COME HERE. THIS IS A CLASSROOM? WE HAVE NO SPACE, SISTER BERTRILLE. MOST OF THE CONVENT IS TAKEN UP FOR THE HOSPITAL WARDS FOR THE OLD PEOPLE. OH, GOOD GRIEF. THIS LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF CHARLES DICKENS. AND WHY ARE SOME OF THOSE KIDS WEARING THOSE AWFUL CLOTHES? THEY ARE THE ORPHANS WHO LIVE HERE AT THE CONVENT. THAT IS THE UNIFORM. OH, BUT THE POOR DEARS LOOK SO HOT WITH ALL THAT HAIR AND THOSE CLOTHES. IS THERE NO EQUIPMENT? NO MONEY. WELL, SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS. OH, THANK YOU, SISTER. SISTER BERTRILLE, MAYBE IF YOU PRAYED. WELL, YOU ALL ARE A-SORRY-LOOKING MESS, YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU? IT IS VERY HOT, SISTER. HMM. I KNOW IT'S HOT. UH... BUT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER.

FIRST, THOSE RIDICULOUS COSTUMES YOU MADE. WELL, I KNOW THE COLORS ARE A BIT SPECTACULAR, BUT I HAD TO MAKE DO WITH REMNANTS. IT IS UNBECOMING FOR GIRLS TO WEAR SHORTS. GIRLS WEAR DRESSES, BOYS WEAR TROUSERS GREY TROUSERS, NOT DOTTED POLKAS. THEN, THERE WAS THAT UNDIGNIFIED EXHIBITION AT THE TOWN SQUARE. DO YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH ATTENTION YOU ATTRACTED? BUT THAT WAS THE POINT. REVEREND MOTHER, SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE DONE. THE... THE CLASSROOMS ARE OVERCROWDED, THERE ISN'T ANY EQUIPMENT. AND DO YOU THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT? FOR 20 YEARS, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE AGAINST INADEQUATE SPACE, NOT ENOUGH BOOKS, BAD PLUMBING, AND NOT ENOUGH MONEY. FOR 20 YEARS, SISTER. AND YOU, YOU SPEND ONE WEEK HERE AND TELL ME WHAT IS NEEDED. FORGIVE ME, REVEREND MOTHER. SOMETIMES I SPEAK FIRST AND THINK AFTERWARD. SISTER BERTRILLE, YOU ARE YOUNG, WITH YOUNG ATTITUDES. AND I AM TRYING TO TAKE ALL THIS INTO CONSIDERATION. NOW, LET ME ACQUAINT YOU WITH THE REALITIES OF SAN TANCO. FIRST, THERE IS THE QUESTION OF MONEY. WELL, I HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT THAT. YES, I HAVE SEEN SOME OF YOUR IDEAS. I AM SORRY, SISTER BERTRILLE. I KNOW THAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE GOOD. BUT, YOU SEE, EVEN WITH THE MONEY, WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY LAND TO BUILD ON. WELL, I SAW THIS GREAT LOT IN OLD SAN JUAN, IT WOULD BE A PERFECT LOCATION. I KNOW THE LAND YOU SPEAK OF. IT IS OWNED BY A MAN NAMED CARLOS RAMIREZ, WHO ABSOLUTELY REFUSES TO SELL. OH, I KNOW SENOR RAMIREZ. SOMEHOW I'M NOT SURPRISED. NOW, UH, SISTER BERTRILLE, YOU ARE NEW HERE, SO I AM WILLING TO OVERLOOK YOUR BREACH OF CONDUCT, BUT IN THE FUTURE, SISTER, PLEASE REMEMBER, DIGNITY. RIGHT. SISTER JACQUELINE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? OH, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED SOME CHEERING UP. WELL, THANK YOU, BUT I'M FINE. I ONLY HAVE ONE PROBLEM. WHAT'S THAT? HOW TO GET THE LAND WE NEED. I THINK I'LL GO AND SEE SENOR RAMIREZ. DID THE REVEREND MOTHER SAY YOU COULD? WELL, SHE DIDN'T SAY I COULDN'T. ♪ I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE IN ST. THOMAS. WE LEAVE FRIDAY NIGHT, AND SPEND A MARVELOUS, RELAXING WEEKEND GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER. I DIDN'T SAY I WAS GOING, CARLOS. YOU SHOULD TRUST ME, MARIA. YOU WILL COME. ALL RIGHT. BUT IF YOU PROMISE NOT TO... WHAT IS IT? THERE'S A NUN IN BACK OF YOU. SORRY TO CUT IN, BUT, UH, COULD I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? YES. THIS WAY, PLEASE. SEE YOU ON SUNDAY AT MASS. GO AHEAD KIDS, DANCE. YOU DANCE GREAT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. HOW CAN YOU COME HERE LIKE THIS? YOU MEAN, WHAT'S A NICE GIRL LIKE ME DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS? WELL, THERE IS DANCING, DRINKING AND GAMBLING THERE, SISTER. AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF BEING CONTAMINATED? ARE ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE CONTAMINATED? BUT YOU ARE A SISTER. ALL THE MORE REASON I SHOULD SET AN EXAMPLE. A-AT A DISCOTHEQUE? TO SHOW THAT THE CHRISTIAN LIFE CAN FLOURISH IN THE LAND OF REALITY. BOY, YOU ARE SOME NUN, YOU KNOW THAT? WHEN I WAS A CHILD, THE SISTERS NEVER... EXCUSE ME, SENOR. I WISH YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THE SISTERS, AS IF WE WERE ALL TURNED OUT ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE. WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT, WITH DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES. WE'RE REALLY LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, SENOR. WELL, WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME ABOUT, SISTER? ABOUT YOUR VACANT LOT. YOU SEE, SENOR, WE'RE IN DESPERATE NEED OF SPACE. WELL, I'M GOING TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THAT LAND, SISTER. OH, WHEN IS THAT? WHEN I SETTLE DOWN. WHEN I FIND THE RIGHT GIRL. WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY LOOKING HARD ENOUGH. WELL, IN... IN ANY CASE, I'M NOT GOING TO SELL THE LAND. NO, I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD. I BELIEVED YOU MIGHT DONATE IT. WELL, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE SOME VERY STRANGE BELIEFS, SISTER. WELL, I AGREE WITH ST. IRENAEUS. ST. IRENAEUS? YES. THAT THE GLORY OF GOD IS MAN, FULLY ALIVE. AND THAT... AND THAT WHATEVER PROMOTES LIFE AND GROWTH IS GOOD. IT'S ALL A MATTER OF POTENTIAL, REALLY. AND WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH ME AND MY LAND? WELL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT DONATE YOUR LAND BECAUSE YOU HAVE A... A POTENTIAL FOR GOOD WITHIN YOU. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LAWYER. YOU MISSED YOUR CALLING. I DON'T THINK SO, SENOR. YOU KNOW, I LIKE YOU. I REALLY DO. BUT I AM A BUSINESSMAN FIRST, A FRIEND SECOND. I'M SORRY. OK, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, SENOR. OH, SISTER BERTRILLE, PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR. AND DON'T COME TO MY DISCOTHEQUE AGAIN. WELL, YOU GIVE THE PLACE A BAD NAME. ♪ SISTER BERTRILLE CONSIDERED SENOR RAMIREZ REJECTION OF HER APPEAL, A TEMPORARY SETBACK. THERE HAD TO BE A WAY. AND IT WAS ALL OF 2 DAYS BEFORE SHE CAME UP WITH ANOTHER IDEA. IT WILL BE JUST THE TWO US, JULIE AND CARLOS. WELL, LET ME THINK ABOUT IT. MY HOUSE IN ST. THOMAS IS QUIET AND PEACEFUL. IT WILL REALLY GIVE US A CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. DON'T YOU THINK WE NEED A CHAPERONE? OH, MY HOUSE BOY AND HIS WIFE WILL BE THERE. WELL, I GUESS IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT IF... IF WHAT JULIE? TELL CARLOS. DO NUNS SWIM? WHAT? RIGHT OVER THERE, BEHIND YOU. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. HI THERE. I BELIEVE IT. MIND IF I REEL YOU IN? DON'T SPILL YOUR CHAMPAGNE. HERE COMES. ALMOST THERE. SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, I WANTED TO TELL YOU THE MARVELOUS NEWS. I DON'T CARE. WHAT NEWS? YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T DONATE YOUR LAND TO THE CONVENT BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO BUILD A HOUSE THERE? AND THAT IT WAS THE ONLY LAND WITH THAT SORT OF A VIEW? WELL, FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS, I'VE BEEN SEARCHING ALL OVER THE ISLAND AND I'VE FINALLY FOUND IT. YOU FOUND WHAT? ANOTHER PIECE OF LAND WITH THE SAME SORT OF VIEW, AND IT'S VERY REASONABLE, SENOR RAMIREZ. LISTEN, SISTER... OH! ARE YOU OK? HAVE YOU QUITE FINISHED? WELL, ALMOST. YOU SEE, I THOUGHT WE COULD BUY THAT LAND AND GIVE IT TO YOU, AND THEN YOU COULD GIVE... NO. BUT SENOR RAMIREZ. NO, NO, NO, AND NO. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU MY LAND. NOW, GOOD AFTERNOON, SISTER BERTRILLE. GOOD AFTERNOON, SENOR RAMIREZ. WOULD ANYONE LIKE A LIFT ANYWHERE? UH, THANK YOU, SISTER. I'M SORRY, I THINK I'D BETTER GO WITH THE SISTER. THE NEXT GIRL I ASK WILL BE A PROTESTANT. SENOR RAMIREZ'S REFUSAL DIDN'T STOP SISTER BERTRILLE. IT JUST SLOWED HER DOWN A BIT. HER FAITH, AND THE WIND, BUOYED HER SPIRITS. SENOR RAMIREZ ABSOLUTELY REFUSED. HE'S A VERY STUBBORN MAN. OH, WELL, PERHAPS YOUR TIMING MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER. HEY, I THINK I'M GETTING THE HANG OF THIS. OH, BE CAREFUL, SISTER BERTRILLE. OH, DON'T WORRY, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS LOWER MY CORNET, AND VOILA, I LAND. WORTHY OF CHARLES LINDBERGH. ANYWAY, I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP. I JUST KNOW SENOR RAMIREZ WILL DONATE HIS LAND. HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE? BECAUSE BASICALLY HE'S A GOOD MAN. I CAN TELL. WELL, PERHAPS YOU'RE A VERY DISCERNING PERSON, BUT, UH, YOU SHOULD KNOW A FEW FACTS ABOUT SENOR RAMIREZ. YOU SEE, HE'S NOTORIOUS FOR BEING THE BIGGEST GAMBLER AND PROMOTER ON THE ISLAND. OF COURSE, HE'S NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN CONVICTED OF ANYTHING, BUT HE'S NOT ABOVE CUTTING A FEW CORNERS. AND HIS PRIVATE LIFE IS NOT EXACTLY BEYOND REPROACH EITHER. AND APPARENTLY, HIS WHOLE LIFE IS DEDICATED SOLELY TO THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE, AND THE ONLY REASON I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS, I THINK YOU SHOULD... SISTER JACQUELINE. WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? OH, OH, WHY SISTER BERT... WELL, SHE WAS HERE A MOMENT AGO. GOOD GRIEF! SISTER. WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT? A PELICAN? NO, IT'S SISTER BERTRILLE. I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR, BUT THERE'S A NUN TOPSIDE. A WHAT? A NUN, SIR. SHE'S STANDING BY THE RAIL. I THINK SHE'S PRAYING, SIR. YOU LOSING YOUR MIND, KORMAN. WE JUST SURFACED. I KNOW, SIR, I'M AS SURPRISED AS YOU ARE. R-RIGHT THERE, A NUN IN HER UNIFORM. I SWEAR IT, SIR. A, UH, A NUN. YES, WITH, UH, A HAT AND EVERYTHING. KORMAN, ARE YOU A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN? WELL, YES, SIR, JEWISH SIR, SO THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN IT. EXPLAIN WHAT? A VISION, SIR. WHY NOT? W-WOULDN'T I HAVE SEEN A RABBI? WELL, HERE WE ARE. THE PLANE'S ALL READY FOR TAKE OFF. WHAT'S THE RUSH, CARLOS? YOU DROVE OUT HERE AS IF YOU WERE BEING CHASED BY DEMONS. JUST THE OPPOSITE. WHAT? WELL, I JUST WANT TO GET US ON ST. THOMAS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WHY DO YOU KEEP LOOKING BEHIND YOU LIKE THAT? ARE YOU EXPECTING SOMEONE? OF COURSE NOT. I'LL JUST BE MORE R-RELAXED WHEN WE ARE OFF THE GROUND. THAT'S ALL. WHY? LISTEN, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE ALONE WITH YOU, OK? WILL YOU PLEASE GET INTO THE PLANE? ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S WRONG? THERE'S SOMEONE STANDING BEHIND YOU, CARLOS. WEARING A WHITE ROBE AND A FUNNY WHITE HAT? NO, JUST A LEATHER JACKET. LEATHER JACKET? OH, IT'S ONLY THE PILOT. IT'S JUST THE PILOT. HE FLIES THE PLANE. ISN'T THAT GREAT? YEAH. SWELL. HEY, CUT THAT OUT! DO YOU KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN TO ST. THOMAS? DOES IT HAVE BEAUTIFUL SCENERY? NOT COMPARED TO YOU, LOUISE. OH, CARLOS. I UNDERSTAND ST. THOMAS IS A FREE PORT. WHAT CAN I BUY THERE? CARLOS! WE ARE NOT GOING TO ST. THOMAS. YOU'RE KIDDING! PEDRO, TURN BACK TO SAN JUAN. TURN BACK. WHAT FOR? TO DONATE MY LAND TO THE CONVENT. DO YOU HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT NOW? YEAH. BUT WHY? I JUST HAD A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE. SISTER JACQUELINE, WHY DON'T YOU GO AND TRY TO GET SOME REST? I'LL NOTIFY YOU THE MOMENT SISTER BERTRILLE, UH, LANDS. BUT WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO LAND? OH, I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK OF HER OUT THERE ALL ALONE, FLYING WITHOUT INSTRUMENTS. YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL, REVEREND MOTHER? OH, NO, NO, NO. NO, I'M WELL. IT'S JUST THAT I, I FIND IT SO HARD TO ASSIMILATE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED TODAY. YES. IT HAS BEEN A STRANGE DAY. SISTER JACQUELINE, YOU'RE GIVEN TO UNDERSTATEMENT. SISTER BERTRILLE WAS STILL FLYING WHEN NIGHT FELL. SHE MADE IT TO LAND FLYING BY THE SEAT OF HER... UH, FLYING WITHOUT INSTRUMENTS. SHE COULD HAVE PICKED A BETTER LANDING SPOT. HALT, OR I'LL FIRE. I AM HALTED. UH, I'M SORRY. BUT I SEEM TO BE STUCK. COULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND? DON'T TOUCH IT! I'M NOT AN IT, I'M A SHE. WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT YOU ARE SOON ENOUGH. YOU JUST PUT UP YOUR HANDS AND COME ON OUT OF THERE. BUT HOW DO WE KNOW YOU'RE A NUN? WELL, I LOOK LIKE A NUN, DON'T I? SISTER, IT WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR AN ENEMY AGENT TO LOOK LIKE A NUN. AGENT? LOOK, SISTER, WE'RE ON AN ISLAND, 30 MILES AT SEA. THIS IS A HIGHLY RESTRICTED AREA. SUDDENLY A NUN POPS UP OUT OF NOWHERE! HOW DO WE KNOW YOU'RE REALLY A NUN? WELL, I COULD SPEAK SOME LATIN FOR YOU. AN AGENT WOULD HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO SPEAK LATIN. YEAH, YEAH, I COULD RECITE THE UNCHANGEABLE PARTS OF THE MASS. I'M SORRY, WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE MORE POSITIVE PROOF THAN THAT. IT CHECKS OUT, SIR. THE MOTHER SUPERIOR OF THE CONVENT SAN TANCO VERIFIED THAT THERE IS A SISTER BERTRILLE IN THE ORDER WHO ANSWERS TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRISONER. YOU SOUND DISAPPOINTED, LIEUTENANT. THAT DOESN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ESPIONAGE, MAJOR. THE COMMIES ARE INFILTRATING EVERYWHERE. THIS ALLEGED SISTER COULD HAVE BEEN USING THE CONVENT... SIT DOWN, LIEUTENANT! NOW, SINCE, UH, SISTER BERTRILLE IS A CIVILIAN, SHE ALSO COMES UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE SAN JUAN POLICE. I'M AWARE OF THAT, SIR. I PHONED CAPTAIN DOMINIC LOPEZ AND HE'S ON HIS WAY OVER. ALWAYS THINKING, AREN'T YOU, LIEUTENANT? I TRY, SIR. NOW, SISTER, THERE IS A 30-FOOT-HIGH WIRE FENCE AROUND THIS WHOLE BASE. HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE? I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU TOLD THE TRUTH. YEAH. WELL, I FLEW IN. THE AREA WAS SEARCHED, SIR, THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A PARACHUTE. NO, NO, I DIDN'T USE A PARACHUTE. I JUST FLEW IN. IN WHAT? OH, NO. NOT IN A PLANE. JUST ME. YOU SEE, I'M LIGHT AND WHEN THE WIND IS JUST RIGHT, I JUST KIND OF RIDE ON THE CURRENTS. YOU FLY, ON YOUR OWN? WELL, MORE LIKE GLIDE, REALLY. BUT I HIT A DOWN DRAFT. IT WAS ONLY MY SECOND FLIGHT. NOW, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU, UH, GLIDE ON YOUR OWN LIKE, UH, UH, LIKE PETER PAN? OH, WELL, PETER PAN IS JUST A FANTASY. NO, NO, MY FLIGHT IS MORE LIKE A... LIKE THE PELICANS. PELICANS? TELL ME, DOES LIFT, PLUS THRUST MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? YOU SEE, NOW I'M... I'M KIND OF LIGHT AND, WELL, IT'S ALL AERODYNAMICALLY CLEAR AND VERY SIMPLE. NOW, THE WIND LIFTS ME UP LIKE THIS YOU SEE. NOW I CAN GO DOWN LIKE THIS AND I GO OFF THAT WAY, OR I CAN GO DOWN LIKE THIS AND I GO OUT THAT WAY. YOU SEE I'VE BEEN READING UP ON FLIGHTS AND AERODYNAMICS, AND WHILE IT SEEMS IMPROBABLE, IT'S NOT REALLY IMPOSSIBLE. I... I MEAN IF THE WIND WASN'T EXACTLY RIGHT, I'D NEVER EVEN GET OFF THE GROUND. REVEREND MOTHER, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS? SISTER BERTRILLE DOES NOT LIE. I BELIEVE HER. THAT SHE'S BEEN OUT AT NIGHT BALMING ABOUT WITH A BUNCH OF SEAGULLS? ALL RIGHT, LIEUTENANT. REVEREND MOTHER, I'M SO SORRY TO CAUSE YOU ALL THIS TROUBLE. SISTER BERTRILLE, PLEASE. ANY QUESTIONS, CAPTAIN LOPEZ? ONE. NOW, THIS MAY SOUND VERY SILLY, I KNOW, BUT I-I'VE GOT TO ASK IT. HAS ANYONE ACTUALLY SEEN HER, UH, FLY? SISTER BERTRILLE, DID ANYONE EVER ACTUALLY SEE YOU FLY? SENOR RAMIREZ. HE SAW ME FLY. HOW WAS THAT? WELL, HE WAS IN HIS PLANE GOING TO ST. THOMAS, AND I CAME BY AND LOOKED IN THE WINDOW AND WAVED. DID HE WAVE BACK? WHAT AM I SAYING? NO, HE DIDN'T WAVE. BUT HE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZED ME. HOW DO YOU KNOW? HE TURNED GREEN. WELL, ONE WITNESS IS BETTER THAN NONE. IT'S VERY CONVENIENT THAT HE HAPPENS TO BE IN ST. THOMAS. HE'S NOT IN ST. THOMAS. HE'S AT THE CONVENT. GET THE CHOPPER READY. IT'S ALL READY, SIR. NATURALLY. FIRST OF ALL, WHY DID YOU COME BACK TO THE CONVENT TONIGHT, SENOR? TO DONATE MY LAND TO THE CONVENT. OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. UH, PLEASE. WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO DO THIS, SENOR RAMIREZ? WELL, I THOUGHT HAD A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE. PLEASE, TELL US ABOUT THIS. I SAW SISTER BERTRILLE THROUGH THE WINDOW OF MY PLANE, FLYING. YOU SAW SISTER BERTRILLE FLYING, UNAIDED? WELL, I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY, MAJOR. AND NOW THAT I HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT, I REALIZE, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TRICK OF MY MIND. OBVIOUSLY THE SISTER CANNOT REALLY FLY. OBVIOUSLY. UH, SENOR RAMIREZ, I... I DO NOT THINK IT LIKELY THAT YOU HAVE HAD A VISION. THEREFORE, I UNDERSTAND YOUR WITHDRAWING YOUR OFFER OF THE LAND. OH, N-NO, I'M NOT WITHDRAWING MY OFFER, REVEREND MOTHER. WELL, A GAMBLER CANNOT AFFORD TO WELCH ON A DEAL. BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE NOT HAD A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE. WELL, I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THAT. I BELIEVE IN ALWAYS HEDGING MY BETS. THANK YOU, SENOR. GOOD NIGHT, REVEREND MOTHER. GOOD NIGHT. SENOR. ARE YOU GOING TO ST. THOMAS? NO, SISTER, I KNOW WHEN I AM BEATEN. WELL, THAT SATISFIES ME. BUT, MAJOR OVERLAND... I THINK WE'D BETTER LEAVE NOW, LIEUTENANT. WELL, GOOD NIGHT, UH, UH, REVEREND MOTHER. SISTER BERTRILLE, IF YOU EVER GO FLYING AGAIN, I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A COURSE IN NAVIGATION. MAJOR, YOU CAN'T TAKE THE WORD OF THE BIGGEST CONMAN AND GAMBLER ON THE ISLAND. I HAVE OTHER EVIDENCE, LIEUTENANT. YOU MEAN SOMEBODY ELSE SAW HER FLY? OUR RADAR MAN THOUGHT HE SAW A BLIP ON THE SCOPE, BUT IT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. HE ASSUMED IT WAS A PELICAN AND SOMEBODY HAD TAKEN A SHOT AT IT. SIR, WHAT KIND OF REPORT ARE YOU GONNA SEND WASHINGTON? I'M NOT MAKING A REPORT ON THIS, LIEUTENANT. WHY NOT? I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO WORD IT! SISTER BERTRILLE, WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO DOWN IN THE TEETH? MOUTH, SISTER. OH, DON'T WORRY, CAPTAIN LOPEZ IS A VERY SMART MAN. HE WOULD NOT SAY ANYTHING, BECAUSE NO ONE WILL BELIEVE HIM. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT CAPTAIN LOPEZ OR THE ARMY. THE REVEREND MOTHER, I... I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER YET. SHE SAID SHE WANTED TIME TO THINK THINGS OVER. I WOULDN'T BLAME HER IF SHE SENT ME BACK TO THE STATES. WELL, CHEER UP, LITTLE BIRD. JUST LOOK FOR THE SILVER LINING. PLEASE, SISTER, THAT'S HOW I CAUSED ALL THIS TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. YES? WE DO NOT LIKE TO SEE YOU UNHAPPY, HERMANA.

YES, I KNOW IT WOULD HELP SISTER DOMINIC'S RECORD SALES, BUT IT'S REALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR ME. I'M SORRY. NO, EVEN IF I DID HAVE PERMISSION, IT WOULDN'T WORK.
