 The Flying Nun (1967–1970): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Convert - full transcript 
 Sister Bertrille is getting better at flying and takes the occasional practice flight. During one of her flights, she is seen by Carlos Ramirez, who thinks he has seen a religious vision. Because of it, he gives up drinking, gambling and girls, while taking up meditating and going to mass. Carlos' current girlfriend, Dottie, is concerned and goes to Sister Bertrille for help, telling her the story. Although Sister Bertrille is as happy as any of the sisters to see agnostic Carlos going to church, she doesn't want him going on false pretenses, and tells and shows him the truth about her ability to fly. Relieved, he goes back to his old carousing ways and tries to make up for lost time. In a poker match, he loses everything except his yacht. Lou and Tony, his gambling buddies, say that they will let Carlos bet them in any way: the yacht against his losings that night. He goes for what he considers a sure thing: that they will see Sister Bertrille fly unaided. Unbeknowst to Carlos, the Reverend Mother has forbid Sister Bertrille from flying while Bishop Dillon is in town. Carlos tries to convince Sister Bertrille to do this for him, he saying that in a way she is responsible for his predicament. He even threatens to take back the property he donated to the convent, as he has not yet signed the papers. Sister Bertrille goes to Reverend Mother for guidance on this issue. Without hearing the specific issue, the busy Reverend Mother tells her to use her own judgment and do what's best for the convent. So Sister Bertrille flies, just as the Reverend Mother and Bishop Dillon go to visit Carlos at his yacht, Carlos the man who so generously donated the land to the convent. A convenient shove of the Bishop into the water saves Sister Bertrille's secret from the Bishop.

 [barking] (Jacqueline) THIS IS THE CONVENT SAN TANCO IN SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO. UNTIL ONE WEEK AGO, WE WERE MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER TEACHING ORDER. THAT IS WHEN SISTER BERTRILLE CAME TO JOIN US. THINGS WERE NEVER QUITE THE SAME AFTER THAT. YOU SEE, SISTER BERTRILLE FLIES. OH, NOT IN AN AIRPLANE. SHE ONLY WEIGHS 90 POUNDS AND SHE JUST... FLIES. UNFORTUNATELY, HER FIRST LANDING WAS NOT AS GRACEFUL AS HER TAKEOFF. BUT A FEW DAYS LATER,

 IN THE QUIET OF EARLY MORNING, WHEN THE WIND WAS GUSTY, SISTER BERTRILLE'S SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE GOT THE BETTER OF HER AND SHE TOOK TO THE AIR AGAIN. UNFORTUNATELY, HER UNSCHEDULED FLIGHT COINCIDED WITH AN ALL-NIGHT POKER GAME THAT WAS STILL GOING STRONG ON A LUXURY YACHT IN SAN JUAN HARBOR. ♪ [music playing] THE YACHT WAS OWNED BY CARLOS RAMIREZ, WHO WAS A PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER AND THE OWNER OF A DISCOTHEQUE. HE WAS ALSO A PLAYBOY AND AN AGNOSTIC. SISTER BERTRILLE CHANGED ALL THAT IN ONE FELL SWOOP. [footsteps approaching] THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE A BELT, HONEY.

NOW WHAT'S THE MATTER, CARLOS? YOU SICK OR SOMETHIN'? PERHAPS I'VE BEEN SICK ALL MY LIFE, BUT NOW I THINK I'M ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. PLEASE COME IN, SISTER BERTRILLE. THANKS. YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, REVEREND MOTHER? YES. BISHOP DILLION WILL BE ARRIVING IN SAN JUAN TOMORROW AND STAYING A FEW DAYS. NOW, I THINK IT WOULD BE INADVISABLE TO INFORM HIM OF YOUR TALENT FOR AEROBATICS. OH, I DON'T THINK THE SUBJECT WILL COME UP. NO, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, SISTER. I DO NOT WANT YOU TO FLY WHILE THE BISHOP IS ON THE ISLAND. YOU MEAN I'M GROUNDED? I WOULD LIKE YOU TO STAY ON THE GROUND, YES. OH. NOT EVEN A QUICK FLIP AROUND THE CONVENT WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE OUT? WHAT'S THE MATTER, REVEREND MOTHER? [sighing] SISTER BERTRILLE, SINCE YOUR ARRIVAL, I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I'M LIVING IN ALICE IN WONDERLAND. I SAW YOUR FRIEND AT EARLY MASS THIS MORNING, SISTER BERTRILLE. OH, WHICH FRIEND IS THAT? SENOR RAMIREZ. SENOR RAMIREZ? AT MASS? SI. YOU COULD HAVE KNOCKED ME OVER WITH A FATHER. FEATHER, SISTER.

[laughing] AMERICAN, VERY HARD LANGUAGE. WELL, LET'S HOPE THAT SENOR RAMIREZ'S RETURN TO THE FOLD IS PERMANENT. AND THAT HE'S GIVEN UP HIS LIFE AS A PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER. YEAH, I'D LIKE TO THINK HE HAS, BUT I 'LL LAY YOU 8 TO 5 HE HASN'T. [waves crashing] [seagulls cawing] CARLOS! CARLOS! [panting] HI. HELLO. YOU KNOW, I'VE WARNED YOU, CARLOS, NOBODY LIKES A PLAYBOY WHO'S A DRAG. YOU KEEP THIS UP AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET A VERY BAD REPUTATION AMONG THE OTHER GAMBLERS. I'M SORRY, DOTTIE, BUT THERE ARE THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEIR FEELINGS. OH, WHAT IS IT, CARLOS? IS IT ANOTHER GIRL? IN A WAY. WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN "IN A WAY"? PERHAPS I DO OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION. I SAW A NUN FLYING, DOTTIE. WELL, WHAT'S SO STRANGE ABOUT THAT? THERE'S NOTHING IN THEIR RELIGION THAT STOPS THEM FROM FLYING. THIS ONE WAS FLYING WITHOUT A PLANE. WITHOUT A PLANE? YES. NOT EVEN PARACHUTE? JUST FLYING? YES. OH, LOOK... LOOK, CARLOS. YOU KNOW I-I'D BE THE LAST PERSON TO PUT THE KNOCK ON THE NUNS. BUT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF POWER, HONEY. I KNOW. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF SIGN. SIGN? YES. TO CHANGE MY WAY OF LIFE. A VISION.

WELL, HI, DOTTIE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WELL, I HAD TO SEE YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, SISTER. OH, OK. [speaking Spanish] [in English] ENGLISH TRANSLATION: TAKE 5, KIDS. SOME CLASSROOM, HUH? HMM. I TELL YOU, SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THE PRISONER OF ZENDA. WELL, COME ON OVER HERE AND YOU CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM. OH, THANKS, SISTER OH, YOU'RE A REAL DOLL. OH, NO... NO OFFENSE, SISTER. UH, SISTER, I... I WOULD HAVE GONE TO SEE A PRIEST, BUT I FEEL I CAN REALLY TALK TO YOU. I MEAN, YOU USED TO BE A GIRL AND ALL. WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY OF PUTTING IT. ANYWAY, YOU... YOU SEEMED CLOSER TO THE PROBLEM. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, [stuttering] I'M GETTING TO THAT. SEE, IT'S ABOUT CARLOS. NO KIDDING, SISTER, I-I'M WORRIED SICK ABOUT HIM. HE'S GIVEN UP GAMBLING AND DRINKING AND EVEN GIRLS. BUT, NO KIDDING, HE'S TURNING INTO SOME KIND OF MONK! OH. [stuttering] NO OFFENSE. I KNOW HE'S BEEN COMING TO MASS EVERYDAY, DOTTIE, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT COULD REALLY BE CONSIDERED A TURN FOR THE WORSE. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S SUDDENLY CHANGED. HE'S HAVING [whispering] RELIGIOUS HALLUCINATIONS. [whispering] WHAT KIND OF HALLUCINATIONS? HOLD ON TO YOUR HAT, SISTER. HE SAYS HE'S SEEN A NUN FLYING. OH, SWELL. HE EVEN THINKS IT'S SOME KIND OF VISION OR SOMETHING. BUT I... I TOLD HIM THAT, WELL, YOU PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT SORT OF THING, BUT HE... HE JUST WON'T LISTEN. WELL, W-WHAT DO YOU THINK, SISTER? I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE NIPPED IN THE BUD RIGHT AWAY! SISTER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON ROLLER SKATES? WELL, THE REVEREND MOTHER TOOK THE CAR, SO I BORROWED THESE FROM ONE OF THE KIDS. I GOT TO SEE SENOR RAMIREZ FAST. WHY? SO HE CAN GO BACK TO GAMBLING AND GIRLS. I BEG YOUR PARDON. WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN, BUT I JUST FOUND OUT THAT HE'S BEEN COMING TO MASS BECAUSE HE SAW ME FLYING AND THINKS HE HAD A VISION. I'VE GOT TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH. BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED HIM TO COME TO CHURCH. YES, BUT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS, NOT BECAUSE HE SAW ME FLIPPING OFF IN THE WILD BLUE YONDER. THAT'S THE EASY WAY TO GET CONVERTS. YOU UNDERSTAND? I THINK SO. DON'T TAKE TOO LONG. THE BISHOP'S EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON AND HE'LL BE INSPECTING THE CLASSROOMS! CHECK! CARLOS! SENOR RAMIREZ! CARLOS! OH, I'M SO GLAD I FOUND YOU. WHY DO YOU GO TO SEE ME? WELL, I HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME, SO I'LL GET RIGHT TO THE POINT. YOU'VE CHANGED BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOU SAW A VISION OF ME FLYING, RIGHT? OH, SISTER BERTRILLE, MY VISION OF YOU IS NOT A LAUGHING MATTER. BUT IT'S NOT A VISION. YOU SEE, I CAN FLY. LOOK, CARLOS, IT'S VERY SIMPLE. YOU SEE, I ONLY WEIGH 90 POUNDS, AND THE COMBINATION OF MY CORNET AND THE WIND LIFTS ME. SO HOW COME YOU NOT FLYING NOW? I HAVE SKATES IN MY HANDS. OH, SISTER, WOULD YOU PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE? CARLOS, I HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO ARGUE. LOOK, IF I GIVE YOU A QUICK DEMONSTRATION, WILL YOU BELIEVE ME THEN? YOU ARE GOING TO FLY NOW? YEAH, WELL, JUST A QUICK HOP, BUT YOU'LL GET THE IDEA. LET'S SEE, I NEED SOME ELEVATION FOR TAKEOFF. THAT ROCK'LL DO. OH, SISTER, SISTER, YOU'RE GOING TO FALL FROM THERE. YEAH, THEY LAUGHED AT THE WRIGHT BROTHERS, TOO. LOOK, YOU JUST KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED FOR PEOPLE. I DON'T WANT ANYMORE COUNTERFEIT CONVERTS. WIND'S NOT BAD. THERE. NOW, I JUST JETTISON MY SKATES AND I'M READY FOR TAKEOFF. CONTACT. CONVINCED? CONVINCED. NOW, CARLOS, JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE LEARNED IT WASN'T A VISION, THAT'S NO REASON TO STOP COMING TO MASS. I MEAN, THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER REASONS... WHERE ARE YOU GOING? FIRST, I'M GOING TO GET DRUNK. THEN, I'M GOING TO GAMBLE, AND THEN... CARLOS. SISTER, I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO REGAIN MY REPUTATION. (Rev. Mother) ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, YOUR GRACE, WE HAVE ENJOYED SOME MEASURE OF SUCCESS, DESPITE THE HANDICAPS. OF COURSE, OUR MAJOR PROBLEM IS STILL A LACK OF FUNDS. WE'VE HAD TO MAKE DO WITH SUCH INADEQUATE... SISTER BERTRILLE, SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN YOUR CLASSROOM? [stuttering] WELL, I WAS JUST ON MY WAY, REVEREND MOTHER. UH, YOUR GRACE, THIS IS SISTER BERTRILLE WHO TEACHES KINDERGARTEN. SHE'S BEEN WITH US JUST 2 WEEKS. YOUR GRACE. SISTER. WHY ARE YOU CROUCHING LIKE THAT, SISTER? WELL... WELL, I OFTEN STAND LIKE THIS, YOUR GRACE. OH. I WAS JUST LOOKING AT YOUR CLASSROOM. OH, GREAT PLACE IF YOU'RE A MOLE, HUH? I... I MEAN, THAT'LL ALL CHANGE NOW THAT SENOR RAMIREZ HAS DONATED HIS LAND FOR THE NEW SCHOOL. OH, YES, THE REVEREND MOTHER WAS TELLING ME ABOUT THAT. AND I SHOULD LIKE TO MEET THIS SENOR RAMIREZ TO THANK HIM FOR HIS GENEROSITY. OH, I'M SURE HE'LL GET QUITE A KICK OUT OF IT, AND YOU'LL LIKE HIM, TOO. HE'S A GREAT GUY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION, SISTER. YOU MAY LEAVE NOW. AFTER YOU. SISTER BERTRILLE, YOUR CLASS IS WAITING. RIGHT. DOES SHE ALWAYS USE THAT METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION? I WISH SHE DID. [stuttering] UH, SISTER BERTRILLE IS SOMEWHAT UNORTHODOX, BUT HER INTENTIONS ARE GOOD. I'M SURE THEY ARE. REVEREND MOTHER, I AM ANXIOUS TO MEET THIS SENOR RAMIREZ. HE MUST BE A VERY DEVOUT MAN. I'M SURE HE IS, ABOUT SOME THINGS. (Carlos) I'LL RAISE YOU 1,000. OH, HONEY, DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO QUIT? YOU'VE BEEN LOSING FOR 8 STRAIGHT HOURS. MY LUCK'S JUST ABOUT TO CHANGE NOW. I CALL. FLUSH. FULL BOAT. WELL... [sighing] THAT SEES ME OUT. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOST, CARLOS? SURE. EVERYTHING. NOT EVERYTHING. YOU STILL GOT YOUR BOAT. NO, NO. THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP. YEAH, BUT TONY HERE'S GOT A POINT. I MEAN, WE HATE TO QUIT WITHOUT GIVING YOU A CHANCE TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK. HOW ABOUT YOU PUT UP YOUR BOAT AGAINST EVERYTHING YOU LOST. OH, NO, NO. THE CARDS AREN'T ON MY SIDE TODAY. IT DON'T HAVE TO BE POKER. YOU NAME THE BET. ♪ [children singing] WELL, WHAT IS IT, HONEY?

OH, NO, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HER FLY UNAIDED. OH, CARLOS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO START THAT AGAIN! WAIT A MINUTE. ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL US THAT YOU THINK THAT NUNS CAN FLY? OH, NO. NOT ALL NUNS. THAT ONE. [chuckling] THE... THE JOKE'S OVER, GUYS. CARLOS IS JUST PUTTING YOU ON, WEREN'T YOU, CARLOS? OH, NO. I'M PUTTING HER UP. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU'RE WILLING TO BET YOUR BOAT THAT THE LITTLE NUN CAN... THAT'S VERY GOOD. CAN YOU DO BIRD CALLS, TOO? NOW GENTLEMEN, IS IT A BET? YOU MUST BE CRAZY, CARLOS. THERE'S AN OLD SPANISH SAYING [speaking Spanish] WHAT'S THAT MEAN? [in English] PUT UP OR SHUT UP. CARLOS, I CAN'T FLY FOR MONEY. WELL, WHY NOT? ARE YOU AFRAID OF LOSING YOUR AMATEUR STANDING? I CAN'T FLY, PERIOD. I'VE BEEN GROUNDED. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THERE'S A STRONG TRADE WIND. THE WEATHER IS PERFECT. I PROMISED THE REVEREND MOTHER I WOULDN'T FLY WHILE THE BISHOP WAS IN PUERTO RICO. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU, I WOULDN'T HAVE TRIED TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AND GAMBLED SO STUPIDLY. WELL, CARLOS, I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT I... OH, LISTEN, DON'T YOU THINK YOU OWE ME THIS? OWE YOU? YES. I DONATED THE LAND TO THE CONVENT WHEN I SAW YOU FLY THE FIRST TIME, RIGHT? YES. NOW, WHEN I LEARNED THAT THAT WAS NOT A VISION, I DIDN'T TAKE THE LAND BACK. BUT I HAVEN'T SIGNED THE PAPERS YET. YOU'D WELCH ON YOUR PROMISE? WELL, MY YACHT MEANS A LOT TO ME. WELL, I'LL TRY AND GET PERMISSION FROM THE REVEREND MOTHER, BUT IT'S A LONG SHOT. SISTER, I'VE BEEN BACKING LONG SHOTS ALL MY LIFE. SWELL, BUT YOU NEVER BET ON THE REVEREND MOTHER BEFORE. REVEREND MOTHER! REVEREND MOTHER! [station wagon engine starting] OH, HI, YOUR GRACE. UH, REVEREND MOTHER, I NEED YOUR ADVICE. WE HAVE NO TIME NOW, SISTER. UH, HIS GRACE AND I ARE GOING INTO TOWN. BUT IT'S ABOUT, UH, CONVENT POLICY. WELL, SISTER, YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS BY YOURSELF. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, YOUR GRACE? NOW, YOU JUST ASK YOURSELF, "IS IT FOR THE GOOD OF THE CONVENT?" THE ANSWER WILL BE APPARENT. WELL, I GUESS THAT SETTLES THAT. OK, CARLOS, I'LL MAKE ONE PASS OVER THE YACHT. BUT YOU BETTER TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO KEEP THEIR EYES PEELED BECAUSE I DON'T PLAN ON ANY ENCORES. ONCE WILL BE ENOUGH, SISTER. YEAH, IT'LL BE MORE THAN ENOUGH IF THE BISHOP SEES ME. NOW, WE BETTER SYNCHRONIZE OUR WATCHES. HELLO. HELLO. WHAT'S THE MATTER? I JUST REMEMBERED. I DON'T HAVE A WATCH. WELL, ANYWAY, LOOK FOR ME IN 4 MINUTES. FINE. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' FOR? THE NUN. WHO ELSE? [laughing] ARE YOU KIDDIN'? I GOT A FEELING THIS IS A REAL SUCKER BET. IT SMELLS LIKE A SET-UP, YOU KNOW, LOU. I MEAN, WHY WOULD A SHARP GUY LIKE CARLOS BET ON A FLYING NUN UNLESS HE HAD SOME KIND OF INSIDE INFORMATION? 'CAUSE IT'S ALL IN HIS MIND, THAT'S WHY. DOTTIE TOLD US THAT. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, THAT MIGHT BE PART OF THE SET-UP. AND WHAT IF SHE'S SOME KIND OF, UH, SKY DIVER. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, TONY. IF CARLOS CAN SHOW US A NUN FLYING, OR EVEN SKY DIVING, I'M WILLING TO GIVE HIM THE MONEY. SHE'S COMING OVER IN 3 MINUTES. LEVEL WITH US, CARLOS. THIS IS SOME KIND OF JOKE, RIGHT? I CAN'T AFFORD THIS TYPE OF JOKE, LOU. NOW, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME THAT WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE WILL REMAIN JUST BETWEEN THE THREE OF US. SURE, SURE. BUT WHAT ABOUT THEM? THANK YOU, YOUR GRACE. OH, SENOR RAMIREZ, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE BISHOP DILLION. OH, VERY NICE TO MEET YOU, YOUR GRACE. BUT, I AM, UH, RATHER BUSY RIGHT NOW. WELL, I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU PERSONALLY FOR YOUR GENEROUS GIFT OF YOUR LAND. WELL, THANK YOU, YOUR GRACE, BUT I'M, UH, EXPECTING A VISITOR NOW. SHE THE ONE WHO FLIES? I BEG YOUR PARDON? THIS IS MOTHER SUPERIOR FROM CONVENT SAN TANCO AND THIS IS BISHOP DILLION. THEY WERE JUST LEAVING. COULD I TAKE A MOMENT TO LOOK AROUND? I-I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A YACHT BEFORE. OH, WELL, OF COURSE. I'LL SHOW YOU THE CABIN. IN A MOMENT. YES. THE WATER HERE IS SO BLUE. HOLY TOLEDO, THERE SHE IS! YOUR GRACE! I'M EXTREMELY SORRY. I'M AFRAID I... I CAN'T SWIM! (Carlos) HOLD ON, YOUR GRACE. MR. BISHOP, I'LL GET A LIFE BELT! (Bishop Dillion) I'M AFRAID I... I CAN'T SWIM. I CAN'T SWIM. JUST RELAX, YOUR GRACE. I'M A GREAT SWIMMER. WELL, I MUST SAY, IT WAS VERY NICE OF SENOR RAMIREZ TO LEND ME THESE DRY CLOTHES. YEAH. LOOKS GREAT ON YOU, YOUR GRACE. YOU SHOULD WEAR YELLOW MORE OFTEN. SISTER. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW I FELL OVERBOARD. AND HOW DID YOU REACH MY SIDE SO QUICKLY? YOU... YOU... YOU SEEMED TO COME FROM NOWHERE. OH, I WAS JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I SAW YOU HAVING PROBLEMS, SO I JUST DOVE RIGHT IN. WELL, I'M SURE MY CLOTHES ARE DRY BY NOW. YES. THANK YOU AGAIN, SISTER BERTRILLE. YOU SHOULD BE IN THE OLYMPICS. IN WHAT CATEGORY? WHY, SWIMMING, OF COURSE. OH, SWIMMING. THAT IS, UNLESS YOU HAVE OTHER TALENTS, TOO. GOODBYE, SISTER BERTRILLE. YOUR GRACE. AND I'LL SEE YOU LATER, REVEREND MOTHER. YES, YOUR GRACE. [door opening] [door closing] I'M SORRY I HAD TO FLY, REVEREND MOTHER, BUT I FELT IT WAS FOR THE GOOD OF THE CONVENT. SISTER... YES, I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM YOU FACED. BUT IN THE FUTURE, I THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF YOU DIDN'T SEE SENOR RAMIREZ SO FREQUENTLY. THAT WILL BE ALL. YOU CAN GO, SISTER. SISTER. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, HOW DID HIS GRACE FALL OVERBOARD? I DON'T KNOW. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GUST OF WIND, REVEREND MOTHER. YOU KNOW, THE WIND CAN DO STRANGE THINGS IN SAN JUAN. DON'T REMIND ME, SISTER. DON'T REMIND ME.
