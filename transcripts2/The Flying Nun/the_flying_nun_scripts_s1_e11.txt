THAT OF COURSE WAS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF SISTER BERTRILLE. I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE DAY I WAS ASSISTING OUR REVEREND MOTHER PRIOR TO HER DEPARTURE FOR AN EDUCATIONAL SEMINAR ON THE ISLAND OF ST. THOMAS. ALL THE SISTERS' CLASS RESUMES HAD BEEN PROMPTLY SUBMITTED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE.

 YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO TAKE MY RESUME WITH YOU? (Rev. Mother) YES, OF COURSE. COME ALONG, SISTER BERTRILLE, MY PLANE LEAVES IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. OK, REVEREND MOTHER. NINOS. [clapping] SISTER BERTRILLE, YOUR CLASS WORK RESUME. OH, WELL, THIS IS IT. OR THEY ARE IT. YOU MUST REMEMBER WHAT MARSHALL MACLUHAN SAYS. ALL I NEED IS A CONVENTIONAL RESUME, SOMETHING THAT I CAN TAKE WITH ME TO ST. THOMAS. BUT REVEREND MOTHER, THE... THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE. TEACHERS MUST FORGET THE OLD METHODS OF TEACHING. JUST INSTRUCTING THE KIDS ISN'T ENOUGH. WE MUST INVOLVE THEM. WATCH.

 NINOS, LESSON NUMBER 1. HEY, HUP. [chanting] HUP, HUP, HUP, HUP. HEY, HUP, HEY, HUP, HEY, HUP, HUP, HUP. [clears throat] CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO GODLINESS? NO. CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS DISCOVERS PUERTO RICO, AT THE NINA, THE PINTA AND THE SANTA MARIA AND CHRIS HIMSELF. [laughing] OH. SISTER BERTRILLE. REVEREND MOTHER, YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE. NINOS, LESSON NUMBER 2. I HAVE SEEN QUITE ENOUGH, SISTER BERTRILLE. BUT REVEREND MOTHER, THIS IS THE BEST ONE. THIS IS WHERE SIMON BOLIVAR LIBERATES SOUTH AMERICA. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LIBERATE IT WITHOUT ME TODAY I'M AFRAID. READY, SISTER JACQUELINE? BUT REVEREND MOTHER, MAYBE IF THE COMMITTEE COULD SEE MY DEMONSTRATION... THEY MIGHT VERY WELL RECOMMEND CLOSING THE SCHOOL. NOW THEN, UH, SISTER BERTRILLE, CAN'T YOU CONFINE YOUR, UH, EXPERIMENTAL WORK TO THE KINDERGARTEN? AND WHILE I'M AWAY, I AM PUTTING YOU ON YOUR HONOR TO BEHAVE WITH SOME DIGNITY. YES, REVEREND MOTHER. IN EVERY SENSE OF THAT WORD. UNDERSTOOD? UNDERSTOOD. GOOD. BYE-BYE, CHILDREN. SEE YOU SOON. (children) BYE, REVEREND MOTHER. IT'S VERY GOOD. [sighing] [children clamoring] WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, KIDS, I GUESS SOUTH AMERICA WASN'T LIBERATED IN A DAY. [chanting] HEY, HUP, HUP. REVEREND MOTHER'S SPEECH? I LIFTED UP THE SAILS OF THE NINA... SANTA MARIA. ALL HER FACTS AND FIGURES, HER CLASS WORK RESUMES, SHE'S DEPENDING ON THEM. OH, SWELL. SHE'S PROBABLY MISSED THE ENVELOPE BY NOW. OH, AND SHE'S SCHEDULED TO SPEAK AT THAT DINNER TONIGHT. SO WE'LL HAVE TO GET IT TO HER. WELL HOW? ST. THOMAS IS HOURS AWAY BY BOAT, EVEN IF WE HAD A BOAT. WELL, SIMPLE. CARLOS RAMIREZ HAS A PRIVATE PLANE. WELL, WHY SHOULD HE FLY THE REVEREND MOTHER'S SPEECH ALL THE WAY TO ST. THOMAS JUST BECAUSE YOU ASK HIM TO? BECAUSE HE'S MUCH TOO GENEROUS, CONSIDERATE AND UNSELFISH TO SAY ANYTHING BUT YES. NO. (Bertrille) BUT, CARLOS... NO. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. I NO LONGER RISE TO THEM, SISTER. I JUST LIE QUIETLY AND WAIT FOR THEM TO GO AWAY. BUT IT'LL ONLY TAKE YOU A FEW HOURS... NO, NO. TO FLY TO ST. THOMAS AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH... NO, NO! I WAS JUST ABOUT TO FINALIZE A VERY IMPORTANT AGREEMENT. WELL, MAYBE SHE'D ENJOY FLYING TO ST. THOMAS. SHE IS FROM ST. THOMAS. OH? CARLOS, I HAVE TO GET THERE. [whispering] LISTEN. WHAT? YOU AND I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T NEED A PLANE TO FLY TO ST. THOMAS, RIGHT? HAPPY LANDINGS, SISTER. HAVE A NICE FLIGHT. (Jacqueline) CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT SHE HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER, SISTER BERTRILLE CONCLUDED THAT A WORD TO THE WISE WAS SUFFICIENT. SO, FLY SHE DID. BY AFTERNOON, SISTER BERTRILLE REALIZED THAT THE USE OF HER NATURAL INSTINCTS COUPLED WITH THE NAVIGATIONAL TECHNOLOGY OF A COMPASS ADDED UP TO JUST ONE THING: SHE WAS LOST. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE WIND SEEMED TO BE DYING. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE DRAG THAN THRUST. PROVIDENTIALLY, IN THE DISTANCE, SHE SPOTTED A SMALL ISLAND. HER ONLY PROBLEM WAS GETTING THERE BEFORE THE FAILING WINDS SENT HER DOWN IN A FINAL SPIN. GENTLEMEN, THE WHOLE WORLD IS OURS, IF WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO REACH OUT AND TAKE IT. WE DO THE WORK. 24 HOURS A DAY, POLICIN' THE CASINOS, OPERATIN' THE WIRE, CHECKIN' OUT THE NUMBERS TAKE, FIXIN' A RACE, BUYIN' OFF A POLITICIAN, IT NEVER STOPS. WE DO THE WORK, WHO GETS THE PROFITS? HERE'S YOUR ANSWER. I HAD COPIES MADE FOR ALL OF US. THE MONEY THE ORGANIZATION TOOK IN LAST YEAR AND WHERE MOST OF IT WENT, RIGHT INTO THE POCKETS OF THE SCHWIMMER BROTHERS. NO MORE. WE WORK FOR IT. WE KEEP IT. TALC, THE SCHWIMMER BROTHERS AIN'T GONNA LET US KEEP IT. IF THEY KNEW THAT WE WERE HAVIN' THIS MEETIN' WITHOUT THEM, THEY'D HAND LOUIE LARUE A CONTRACT TO WIPE OUT ALL OF US. SURE, THAT'S WHY WE GIVE LOUIE A CONTRACT TO HIT THEM BEFORE THEY HIT US. [all laughing] LOUIE'S FLYING IN THIS AFTERNOON. WE'LL SET THE DEAL WHEN HE GETS HERE. TALC, THIS ISN'T THE '30's. I'M A RESPECTED MAN. I OWN A GENUINE PICASSO, HAND PAINTED. YOU SAID YOU WANTED A BIGGER SHARE OF THE TAKE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GET IT, UNITY. THE SCHWIMMER BROTHERS PROBABLY KNOW ABOUT THIS MEETIN' ALREADY. LOOK, IT'S EITHER THEM OR US. YOU START FEELING TENDERHEARTED FOR THE SCHWIMMERS, TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING TO US. TALC IS RIGHT. THE SCHWIMMERS WOULD CHEAT THEIR OWN MOTHER IF SHE WASN'T DOIN' TIME. (Joe) IT'S THE SCHWIMMERS, OR US. (Beaumont) WELL, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THERE'S NO CHOICE. I THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE A SHOW OF HANDS. DON'T YOU, TALC? TALC? TALC! WHAT? DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE A SHOW OF HANDS ON WHO'S FOR LIQUIDATING THE SCHWIMMERS? (Moon) WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU, TALC? THE MATTER? (Talc) WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME? WELL, UH, ALL OF A SUDDEN I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD. IT'S THE HEAT. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TAKE A FEW MINUTES BREAK? IT'S THE PRESSURE. IN THIS BUSINESS, IT'S ALWAYS THE PRESSURE. IF A HEART ATTACK DOESN'T GET YOU, LOUIE LARUE WILL. I MAKE A MOTION THE MEETING BE ADJOURNED. MEETING ADJOURNED. ADJOURNED. [sighs] (Bertrille) LOOK OUT BELOW! HI, BOY, AM I GLAD... WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU GOT A TRICK KNEE? WELL, I KNOW ALL ABOUT THOSE. MY BROTHER USED TO HAVE ONE, FOOTBALL. HERE, LET ME HELP YOU UP. COME ON. [exclaims] [sighs] YOU'RE... YOU'RE SOLID. OH, THANKS. MY NAME IS SISTER BERTRILLE. I SAW YOU. YOU DID? I REALLY SAW YOU, YOU... OH, THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL. YOUR KNEE AGAIN? WELL, MY BROTHER USED TO WEAR AN ELASTIC BRACE ON HIS. MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A BOAT THAT COULD GET ME TO ST. THOMAS? NOT A SINGLE BOAT ON THE WHOLE ISLAND? I AM SORRY, YOUR SAINTLINESS. BERTRILLE. SISTER BERTRILLE. HOW ABOUT A RADIO? YEAH, A RADIO, GREAT. WELL, MAYBE WE CAN TRY A WEATHER REPORT. IT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING, THE WIND JUST DIED ON ME. BOY, YOU REALLY OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT KNEE. HERE. (radio announcer) FOR THE ST. THOMAS AND ST. JOHN ISLANDS, THE FORECAST IS FOR CLEAR AND CALM THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT WITH FRESHENING EASTERLY WINDS TOMORROW. TOMORROW. A LOW PRESSURE FRONT IS MOVING FROM THE SOUTHEAST. [sighing] YOU SAID YOU DON'T HAVE A BOAT? WELL, THEN HOW DID YOU GET HERE? OH, UH, WE USED A PLANE, YOUR SAINTLINESS. BUT IT WON'T BE BACK TILL THIS EVENING. [sighing] OH, THIS EVENING. WELL, THAT DOES IT. I GUESS THIS IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH. I MEAN GOOD INTENTIONS JUST AREN'T ENOUGH. IT'S WHAT YOU DO OR DON'T DO THAT COUNTS. YES, YOUR SAINTLINESS. BUT THERE'S STILL A CHANCE, ISN'T THERE? I... I MEAN, IT ISN'T TOO LATE? WELL, THERE'S NOT VERY MUCH TIME. OF COURSE, IF THERE WAS A CHANGE. THERE'S GONNA BE. THAT'S A... THAT'S A PROMISE. DO UNTO THE OTHER GUY AS YOU WOULD HAVE THE OTHER GUY DO UNTO YOU. HUH, YOUR SAINTLINESS? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OF COURSE, BUT IT'S JUST PLAIN OLD SISTER BERTRILLE. NOW, WHO DID WE GIVE NORTH DAKOTA TO? GENTLEMEN. AH. WE WERE JUST GONNA SEND OUT A SEARCH PARTY FOR YOU. YEAH, I THOUGHT MAYBE THE SCHWIMMER BROTHERS HAD GOT YOU. [laughing] THAT'S NOT FUNNY. NOW LET'S GET ON WITH IT. WITH WHAT? THE SHOW OF HANDS. DO WE GIVE LOUIE LARUE A CONTRACT TO WIPE OUT THE SCHWIMMERS OR NOT? FELLAS, WE'VE FORGOTTEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL. LIKE WHAT? THE GOLDEN RULE. DO UNTO THE OTHER GUY WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE OTHER GUY DO UNTO YOU. YOU BEEN HITTING THE JUICE? WHAT'S HAPPENED, TALC? I'VE HAD A VISION. SHE'S BEEN SENT TO SAVE US. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT, BUT THERE'S STILL A CHANCE, IF WE CHANGE. WHAT KIND OF A SONG AND DANCE IS THIS? I'LL SHOW YOU. WHAT DOES HE MEAN HE SAW A VISION? (Fremling) FIRST HE'S PUSHING THE CONTRACT, THEN HE'S GIVING US THE GOLDEN RULE. I GOTTA GOLDEN RULE FOR HIM. IF WE DON'T DO UNTO THE SCHWIMMERS, THEY'RE GONNA DO UNTO US. HI. LOUIE, YOU KNOW THOSE HOKEY DISGUISES NEVER WORK. (Talc) COME IN, PLEASE. SHE'S A GIRL. THANK YOU. I'M SISTER BERTRILLE FROM THE CONVENT SAN TANCO. SHE REMINDS ME OF ROSE TUPPERMAN. YOU KNOW, MANNIE TUPPERMAN'S SISTER. HOW'D SHE GET HERE? SHE FLEW IN. I DIDN'T HEAR NO PLANE. NOT IN A PLANE. IN A BALLOON? NO. SHE JUST FLEW DOWN OUT OF THE SKY. ON THE TAIL OF COCK ROBIN. HOW DID SHE REALLY GET HERE? YOUR SAINTLINESS, TELL THEM. DIDN'T YOU FLY IN? UH, SISTER BERTRILLE. AND I DID FLY, BUT YOU SEE, THERE'S A PERFECTLY SIMPLE EXPLANATION. UH, IT... IT PARTLY HAS TO DO WITH MY CORNETTE AND PARTLY THE WIND VELOCITY. IF YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT AERODYNAMICS... I SAW HER WITH MY OWN EYES. IT'S VERY SIMPLE, ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE. I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT AT FIRST. I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT. PEOPLE DON'T FLY. SHE ISN'T PEOPLE. YOU SEE, I WAS ON MY WAY TO ST. THOMAS TO DELIVER THIS ENVELOPE. WE WERE ABOUT TO LET THE CONTRACT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I GET THIS ENVELOPE... ON THE SCHWIMMERS. I LOOKED OUT AND THERE SHE WAS FLYING DOWN OUT OF THE SKY. YES, RIGHT, I'D BEEN LOSING ALTITUDE FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. AND WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE, SHE FLOATED OVER THE TREES. YES. I... I CAUGHT A STRAIGHT UPDRAFT BUT IT DIDN'T LAST. AND LANDED THERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. THEY NEVER LAST, I TELL YOU. IT'S A SIGN. A WARNING. YOU KNOW. "REPENT ERE IT IS TOO LATE." WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING? TO REPENT, BUT IT MAY BE TOO LATE ALREADY. STAY CLOSE TO ME AND PLAY IT COOL, UNDERSTAND? SURE, SURE. BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK ONE OF 2 WAYS. TALC IS UP TO SOMETHING OR HE'S FLIPPED. EITHER WAY WE'RE IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE. SO WHAT DO WE DO? SHUT UP AND LET ME THINK, THAT'S WHAT WE DO. DON'T SAY IT. DON'T SAY WHAT? DON'T SAY WHATEVER YOU WERE GONNA SAY ABOUT TALC AND HER, UH, HER SAINTLINESS. YEAH, BUT, JOEY, YOU GOT TO ADMIT... YOU GOT ANY CHOICES? LOOK, TALC MUST KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. JUST KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND DO LIKE WE ALWAYS DO. (both) WHATEVER TALC WANTS. ♪ [piano playing] HI. COME IN. HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLANE YET? NO. OH, I APPRECIATE YOUR KINDNESS, BUT I HAVE TO GET TO ST. THOMAS SOON SO I CAN GET MY CONNECTIONS BACK TO SAN JUAN. WELL, IT SHOULD BE HERE VERY SOON, YOUR SAINTLINESS. OH, GOOD. AND JUST SISTER BERTRILLE, PLEASE. WHAT HUMILITY. UH, WELL WE WERE JUST ALL SITTING AROUND HERE MEDITATING. OH. SOMEBODY WALKED AWAY FROM A BEAUTIFUL SETUP. MIND? NO. NICE PLACE YOU HAVE. YES. HI. HI, SISTER. I JUST LOVE MUSIC, DON'T YOU? OH, YES. I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT MY GUITAR, BUT IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE IMPEDED BY AIRFLOW. PLAY SOMETHING HER SAINTLINESS WOULD LIKE. UH, SISTER BERTRILLE. I'D LIKE ANYTHING. WELL... WELL... WELL, I...

SHE HAS NO TALENT WHATSOEVER IN THAT DIRECTION. BUT HER INTENTIONS WERE VERY... SISTER JACQUELINE, I DID NOT APPOINT YOU DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. NO, REVEREND MOTHER. WILL YOU PLEASE FILE THESE PAPERS? YES, REVEREND MOTHER. NOW THEN, UH, SISTER BERTRILLE, YOU MUST LEARN THAT 2 WRONGS DO NOT MAKE A RIGHT. AND GOOD INTENTIONS ARE NOT THE BEST MATERIAL FOR BUILDING A VOCATION.

OH, NOT A CHANCE, REVEREND MOTHER. THAT'S HOW I GOT INTO THIS MESS. I'LL CALL CARLOS RAMIREZ BECAUSE HE KNOWS ALL THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT GAMBLING, AND I'M SURE IF THIS IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT, HE WON'T MIND TAKING IT BACK TO MR. EDWARDS AND AT THE SAME TIME HE CAN PICK UP YOUR NOTES AND THEN BRING IT TO YOU AND THEN THAT WOULD SQUARE EVERYTHING AWAY, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW. SOMEHOW I GET THE FEELING THIS IS WHERE I WALKED IN. (Jacqueline) SISTER BERTRILLE'S DETERMINATION TO RETURN THE PAPERS TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNER LITERALLY TURNED INTO A FEDERAL CASE.
