 The Flying Nun (1967–1970): Season 1, Episode 4 - A Bell for San Tanco - full transcript 
 The bell at San Tanco is showing its age. Originally meant only to be temporary, the replacement bell sunk on the ship, the Hidalgo, off the coast of Puerto Rico when it was being shipped from Belgium 200 years prior. When Sister Bertrille can't fix the bell, she suggests looking for the wreck of the Hidalgo. She goes to the one person with the money and the boat to even attempt the location and salvage process: Carlos. Carlos agrees, but he really has other things on his mind. He is doing all of this in an attempt to woo his latest girlfriend, Binkie Worsley. He plans to plant a false treasure map, and buy a new bell for the convent, while taking Binkie out for a supposed sailing adventure to locate the wreck and the bell. His plans are thwarted when Sister Bertrille, with the Reverend Mother's reluctant blessing, insists on tagging along. But at least Carlos can still find his planted new bell and act the hero in front of Binkie, that is until Carlos's assistant, Pedro, spills wine on the map he drew with water soluble ink. Carlos dives again and again and again with no luck in finding the exact spot where Pedro planted the bell. Finally, Carlos finds the bell, just as Binkie goes overboard. They lose her. Sister Bertrille suggests she be the flying scout looking for Binkie from a hundred feet up. They find Binkie, on the most part all right. Carlos has become her savior and again plays the hero. However, Carlos' romantic plans are once again laid to rest as Binkie saw Sister Bertille flying while she was on death's edge out in the water, seeing it as a religious vision to change her ways. As for the bell, Pedro is having a hard time removing all the fake barnacles he placed on it because what they found was the real 200 year old bell.

UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE WERE MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER TEACHING ORDER. THAT WAS WHEN SISTER BERTRILLE CAME TO JOIN US. THINGS HAVE NEVER BEEN QUITE THE SAME SINCE. YOU SEE, SISTER BERTRILLE FLIES. OH, NOT IN AN AIRPLANE. SHE ONLY WEIGHS 90 POUNDS, AND WHEN THE WIND IS RIGHT, SHE JUST FLIES.

 BUT EVEN WITH HER FEET ON THE GROUND, SISTER BERTRILLE SOMEHOW MANAGES TO KEEP THINGS UP IN THE AIR. TAKE OUR BELL, FOR INSTANCE. IT HAD SUMMONED US TO PRAYERS AND SERVED OUR ORDER FAITHFULLY, FOR ALMOST 3 CENTURIES. IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED THAT ONE DAY [bell ringing] THE BELL WOULD SHOW SIGNS OF GIVING UP THE GHOST. BUT OUR SISTER BERTRILLE IS NOT IN THE HABIT OF LETTING ANYBODY OR ANYTHING GIVE UP. [exclaiming] DON'T WORRY. I CAN FIX IT. SISTER, REVEREND MOTHER SENT ME TO... OH. [bell clanging] ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? YEAH.

 THE CLAPPER'S LOOSE, THAT'S ALL. OH. IT'S NOT STRIKING HARD ENOUGH. AH. HAMMER, PLEASE. OH, THERE. [sighing] THANKS. [panting] [crackling] OH. SISTER, THIS BELL'S RUST IS RUSTING. WELL, WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING A NEW ONE FOR SOME TIME NOW. 203 YEARS, TO BE EXACT. DON'T YOU THINK SOMEONE OUGHT TO SEND A TRACER THROUGH? OH, WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. THIS BELL WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE ANYTHING BUT TEMPORARY. UGH, SCREWDRIVER. OH, YES. YOU SEE, ON THE CONVENT'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY, THE MOTHER HOUSE HAD A BEAUTIFUL NEW ONE FORGED FOR US IN BELGIUM. MMM? BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THEY SHIPPED IT TO US ON A FRIGATE CALLED THE HIDALGO. YOU MEAN THE ONE THAT SANK OFF THE COAST HERE? UH-HUH. I GUESS THEY DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE IN THOSE DAYS. AND OF COURSE, WE'VE NEVER HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE. WELL, THAT'S OK, 'CAUSE THIS BELL'S AS GOOD AS NEW NOW. AH, THERE. OH, WHILE WE'RE UP HERE, DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO TEST IT? LET THE NEIGHBORHOOD KNOW WE'RE BACK IN TUNE AGAIN? ALL RIGHT. OK. [bell clanging discordantly] SISTER, HAS ANYONE EVER REALLY SEARCHED, I MEAN, REALLY SEARCHED FOR THE WRECK OF THE HIDALGO? (Jacqueline) AN UNDERWATER SALVAGE JOB REQUIRES A BOAT AND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY. SISTER BERTRILLE KNEW ONLY ONE PERSON IN SAN JUAN WHO HAD BOTH. NO, CARLOS. IT BRINGS BACK SUCH PAINFUL MEMORIES. LORD CEDRIC USED TO NIBBLE MY ANKLE. [seagulls calling] WAIT! OH, HI. UH, IS SENOR RAMIREZ IN? SI, BUT HE CANNOT BE DISTURBED. WELL, THIS IS KIND OF AN EMERGENCY. I'M SORRY, SISTER, BUT SENOR RAMIREZ IS IN A VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS CONFERENCE. UH, TELL ME, DARLING, DO I HAVE A CHANCE TO BE FIRST AT... ANYTHING? SWEETIE, CAN I HELP IT IF LIFE IS SO DEJA... DEJA VU? [knocking on door] PEDRO! I'M SORRY, SENOR, BUT SISTER BERTRILLE IS HERE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A SISTER. HI, THERE. OH, I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME. A NUN! HOW REFRESHING. SISTER BERTRILLE, THIS IS... MISS BINKIE WADSWORTH. REFRESHED, I'M SURE. NOW, SISTER, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? [seagulls calling] (Carlos) ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? CARLOS, THAT BELL WAS DESIGNED FOR OUR TOWER. WE'LL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET ANOTHER ONE. SISTER, THERE ARE MILES AND MILES OF WATER OUT THERE. THE HIDALGO COULD HAVE ROTTED AWAY TO TRINIDAD BY NOW. BUT THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A MAP IN THE CAPTAIN'S HOUSE THAT TELLS EXACTLY WHERE THE BOAT WENT DOWN. CAPTAIN BROPHY'S BEEN DEAD FOR 200 YEARS. THE HOUSE IS A RUIN. AND THAT STORY ABOUT THE MAP IS PROBABLY STARTED BY THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. SWEETY, WHERE IS YOUR SENSE OF ADVENTURE? IT'S A TREASURE HUNT. IT'S SHEER CAMP. SHEER WHAT? CAMP. ZINGY! KICKY-POO? OH. I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN. WOULD YOU COME ON THIS TREASURE HUNT WITH ME? TRY TO KEEP ME AWAY. SISTER. HUH? YOU WILL HAVE YOUR BELL. I, CARLOS RAMIREZ, WILL NOT RETURN TO DRY LAND UNTIL I HAVE FOUND IT. REALLY? GEE, YOU CERTAINLY WERE EASY TO CONVINCE. I BET SISTER JACQUELINE WOULD TAKE ALL AFTERNOON. WELL, YOU DIDN'T COUNT ON MY SENSE OF ADVENTURE. REALLY? TOMORROW WE'LL GO TO THE CAPTAIN'S HOUSE AND FIND THE MAP. AND YOU WILL HAVE YOUR BELL BY THE END OF THE WEEK. OH, CARLOS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE PLEASURE WILL BE ALL MINE. PEDRO. ORDER SOME PROVISIONS FOR THE BOAT. THE WEEKEND SPECIAL? FOR 2. AND I WANT YOU TO GET AHOLD OF AN OLD MAP SOMEWHERE AND TAKE IT OUT TO THE CAPTAIN BROPHY'S HOUSE. A MAP? THEN I WANT YOU TO GO AND BUY A BELL. (Binkie) CARLOS. (Carlos) YES, BINKIE. YES, HERE. STAND BY. OH, SWEETIE, I'M SO EXCITED. I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A TREASURE HUNT BEFORE. NOT WITH BASIL, OR CEDRIC, OR KURT? OR MARCO, OR LARS. I CAN'T WAIT. OH, LISTEN, WHY DON'T WE GO OUT TO THE CAPTAIN'S HOUSE TONIGHT? JUST THE 2 OF US. SISTER BERTRILLE EXPECTS TO GO WITH US. WE... WE'LL SURPRISE SISTER BERTRILLE. WE'LL FIND THE MAP AND SURPRISE HER WITH IT. IN FACT, I WOULD LIKE TO FIND THE BELL AND SURPRISE HER WITH THAT, TOO. THE CAPTAIN'S HOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO BE HAUNTED. CAMP? A HAUNTED HOUSE. ZINGY. KICKY-POO. IF THE BELL OF SAN TANCO WERE TO BE FOUND, SOMEONE WOULD HAVE DONE SO A LONG TIME AGO. BUT, REVEREND MOTHER, HAS ANYONE REALLY LOOKED FOR THE BELL IN ALL THE 200 YEARS? I CANNOT SAY FOR CERTAIN. APPEARANCES TO THE CONTRARY, MY TENURE HERE HAS NOT BEEN QUITE THAT LENGTHY. IF A MAN OF SENOR RAMIREZ', UH, WORLDLINESS IS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE, UH, ODDS... UH, YES, I MUST SAY THAT ASTOUNDS ME. YEAH, IT SURPRISED ME, TOO. BUT HE'S RARIN' TO GET STARTED, AND TOMORROW MORNING WE'RE GOING TO THE CAPTAIN'S HOUSE TO LOOK FOR THE MAP. I WOULD RATHER THAT YOU DID NOT. WHY? CAPTAIN BROPHY'S HOUSE IS A TOURIST ATTRACTION. I CANNOT HAVE A MEMBER OF THIS ORDER SCURRYING ABOUT THERE IN... IN BROAD DAYLIGHT LOOKING FOR A MAP WHICH PROBABLY DOESN'T... [bell clanging discordantly] EXIST. GO TONIGHT. [door creaking] [wind howling] [floorboard creaking] [crashing] [whispering] CARLOS! [bell ringing] [exclaims] OH. CAMP? ZINGY. KICKY-POO. DON'T WORRY, LITTLE RABBIT. I WILL PROTECT YOU. COME ON. ISN'T THE STUDY THE OBVIOUS PLACE TO LOOK? TOO OBVIOUS. SOMEONE WOULD HAVE FOUND THE MAP LONG AGO. OH. WHA... WHAT ISN'T OBVIOUS? THE BEDROOM. OH. [creaking] I WONDER, IF BY ANY CHANCE, THE MAP COULD POSSIBLY BE IN THIS WEATHER-BEATEN OLD SEA CHEST? [door creaking] [wind howling] SOMEONE'S HERE. OH, RIDICULOUS. IT'S THE WIND. [creaking] [exclaiming] LOOK. [Binkie exclaiming] WHAT IS IT? [whispering] GHO... GHOSTS. NOW, THERE'S NO SUCH THING. [door banging] THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS GHOSTS. [floorboard creaks] [quavering] ♪ HELLO, CAPTAIN PUMPERTINKLE ♪ ♪ HOW ARE YOU TODAY? ♪ [Bertrille whispering] ♪ THANK YOU, SIR ♪ ♪ I'M VERY WELL I MUST BE ON MY WAY ♪ ♪ I'M ON MY WAY ♪ ♪ I'M ON MY WAY ♪ ♪ I'M ON MY WAY ♪ ♪ I'M ON MY WAY ♪ (sisters) ♪ I'M ON MY WAY I'M ON MY WAY ♪ ♪ I'M ON MY WAY I'M ON MY WAY ♪ ♪ HELLO, BETTY FLIARD-PUPPY, HOW ARE YOU... ♪ [crashing] [all screaming] BOO. WHAT MADE YOU THINK OF LOOKING IN THE BEDROOM? I HAD AN INSTINCT. UNLESS APPEARANCES DECEIVE ME, I WOULD SAY THAT HERE IS WHERE THE HIDALGO SANK. (Bertrille) HMM, THAT'S ABOUT AN HOUR'S TRIP FROM HERE. WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET UNDER WAY? WE? THE LEAST I CAN DO IS GIVE YOU A HAND. OH, PLEASE. DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF. OH, NO, NO. IT'S NO TROUBLE. REALLY. YOU HAVE YOUR DUTIES AT THE CONVENT. OH, THE OTHER SISTER WILL TAKE OVER FOR ME. BUT THAT'S PASSING THE BUCK. DO YOU THINK REVEREND MOTHER WILL PERMIT YOU TO GO SKIN DIVING? OF COURSE NOT. IT IS FRIVOLOUS. BENEATH YOUR DIGNITY. WELL, I THOUGHT I COULD ASK THE REVEREND MOTHER IF JUST THIS ONCE I COULD LEAVE MY DIGNITY AT HOME. JUST THIS ONCE. SENORITA WADSWORTH IS IN HER CABIN. CAN'T THEY WORK ANY FASTER? THEY KILL THEMSELVES NOW. SENOR, THE MOTHER SUPERIOR IS NO GOING TO LET THE SISTER GO SKIN DIVING. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE? THE MOTHER SUPERIOR IS ONLY THE HEAD OF THE CONVENT. WHAT CHANCE DOES SHE HAS AGAINST SISTER BERTRILLE? FASTER. FASTER. [water splashing] [boat creaking] OH, MADRE MIA. [scoffs] I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR BOSS IN SUCH A STATE. WHO IS THE YOUNG LADY WHO DESERVES ALL THIS? GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. THIS TIME HE GOES TOO FAR! [yelling in Spanish] [yelling] (Bertrille) CARLOS. HI. GOOD MORNING. GUESS WHAT? I CONVINCED THE REVEREND MOTHER IT WOULD BE OK. SHE SAID NO SCUBA. BUT I... I COULD COME ALONG FOR THE RIDE. KICKY-POO. (Jacqueline) SO, THE TREASURE HUNT BEGAN. IT WAS NOT ALL SMOOTH SAILING, LITERALLY OR OTHERWISE. CHAMPAGNE, SISTER? CAVIAR? OH, NO, THANK YOU. I'VE ALREADY HAD MY BREAKFAST. OH, WASN'T IT SWEET, SWEET, SWEET OF CARLOS TO ARRANGE THIS LITTLE LARK JUST TO LIFT ME OUT OF MY DOLDRUMS? OH, DO YOU FALL INTO THE DOLDRUMS OFTEN, MISS WADSWORTH? WELL, AFTER ALL, WHAT DOES LIFE BOIL DOWN TO BUT PARTIES, PARTIES, PARTIES? MEN, MEN, MEN. DULL, DULL, DULL. GEE. GEE. GEE. (Carlos) ARE YOU SURE THIS IS WHERE THE BELL WAS LOWERED? I PERSONALLY SAW TO EVERYTHING MYSELF. THE TARNISHING OF THE BELL, THE ADDING OF THE BARNACLES, THE LOWERING. WE WILL GO DOWN ONCE AND FIND THE TREASURE. I WILL FIND THE TREASURE. I AM THE HERO OF THIS TRIP. [both chuckling] DID YOU HAVE TO USE WASHABLE INK? DO NOT WORRY, SENOR. I WILL FIND THE SPOT AGAIN. HOW? ARE YOU GOING TO RECOGNIZE THE WAVES? [water splashing] CARLOS, THIS IS NO FUN AT ALL. PATIENCE. [panting] SWEETIE, LET'S DROP THIS NONSENSE. IT'S DULL, DULL, DULL. (Carlos) THAT MAY BE. BUT WE PROMISED SISTER BERTRILLE THAT WE WILL FIND HER HER BELL. WELL, I'M BORED, BORED, BORED. WELL, THEN FISH, FISH, FISH. YOU MIGHT HOOK A MARLIN THAT CAN TAP DANCE. YOU'RE NOT ZINGY AT ALL. CARLOS, MAYBE WE OUGHT TO GIVE UP. YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED. NO, SISTER BERTRILLE, WE ARE GOING TO FIND YOU A BELL. AS FOR YOU, COLUMBUS, INTO YOUR SUIT. YOU, TOO, CAN BE A TREASURE HUNTER. YOU FOUND IT? YES. [exclaiming] BUT WOULD YOU PLEASE FEED ME THAT LINE? ON THE DOUBLE, CAPTAIN. FAST. OH, PLEASE, BINKIE, GIVE A HAND TO SISTER BERTRILLE. YOU AND I ARE NO LONGER SPEAKING, SENOR RAMIREZ. [pulley whirring] MY FUN, FUN, FUN! AT LAST, A CHALLENGE. HOW MUCH CAN ONE BELL WEIGH? I DON'T KNOW. THE MAN WHO SOLD IT... [exclaiming] THE MAN WHO SOLD WHAT? NOTHING, SISTER. NOTHING! THE BELL OF SAN TANCO. [screams] HELP! OH, BINKIE, I'M BUSY. (Binkie) CARLOS. PLEASE, CARLOS. WHAT IS IT NOW, BINKIE? BINKIE? BINKIE? [boat engine rumbling] POOR BINKIE. SHE WENT BRAVELY, BRAVELY, BRAVELY. I WILL RADIO THE COASTGUARD. BUT THAT'LL TAKE SO MUCH TIME. DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO START LOOKING FOR HER OURSELVES? OK. I'LL SWIM THAT WAY. YOU SWIM THIS WAY. AND THE COASTGUARD WILL LOOK FOR 3 BODIES. SISTER, IT'S A BIG OCEAN. WHERE DO WE LOOK FIRST? HAVE YOU EVER TRIED NAVIGATING BY A FLYING NUN? WHY, AT A 1,000 FEET, I CAN SEE FROM HERE TO MIAMI. BUT I WILL NEED A LITTLE MORE WIND FOR TAKE-OFF. UH, PEDRO, GIVE ME A HAND HERE, PLEASE. SI, SENOR. WHAT COURSE DO YOU FOLLOW, SENOR? (Carlos) DIVINE INSPIRATION. NOW GET BELOW. [boat engine accelerating] [inaudible] [whistling] THIS IS DREARY, DREARY, DREARY. IT'S A DREAM. OH, CARLOS. [sneezing] OH, I'VE BEEN A FOOL, FOOL, FOOL. SELFISH, SELFISH, SELFISH. WITLESS, WITLESS, WITLESS. AND YOU SAVED MY LIFE. MMM-HMM. HOW CAN I EVER MAKE THAT UP TO YOU? OH, WE WILL FIND A WAY. OH. THEN YOU FORGIVE ME. OF COURSE. TOMORROW WHEN YOU GET OUT OF HERE, WE'LL GO ON A LONG CRUISE. OH. JUST THE TWO OF US. WE WILL LAZE IN THE SUN. SLOWLY OUR WOUNDS WILL HEAL. OH. SWEETIE, I CAN'T. YOU CAN'T? NO. THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING HAPPENED TO ME. JUST BEFORE YOU SAVED ME YESTERDAY, WHEN I WAS DROWNING, I HAD THIS VISION. I THOUGHT I SAW SISTER BERTRILLE COMING OUT OF THE SKY, THROWING ME A LIFE PRESERVER. WELL, OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS A WARNING. A WARNING OF WHAT? THAT IT'S TIME FOR ME TO CHANGE MY WAYS. SISTER BERTRILLE HAS ARRANGED FOR ME TO GO AWAY TO A RETREAT TOMORROW TO THINK THINGS OUT. I'LL BE BACK IN A FEW MONTHS. I WILL BE A NEW PERSON. OH, SWEETIE, YOU WON'T KNOW ME. I'M SURE I WON'T, BINKIE. I'M SURE I WON'T. EXCUSE ME. I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU NEEDED THIS FOR THE FLOWERS. YOU THINK OF EVERYTHING, DON'T YOU? (Carlos) PEDRO, I TOLD YOU TO CLEAN IT UP. SENOR, IT WOULD NOT CLEAN. OH, PEDRO. (Rev. Mother) EXCUSE ME, SENOR RAMIREZ. I'M SURE THAT HE DID THE VERY BEST HE COULD. AFTER ALL, IT HAS BEEN UNDER THE WATER FOR A LONG TIME. [birds chirping] SISTERS, I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE. [bell tolling] YES, SENOR? I TOLD SISTER BERTRILLE THAT WE WOULD FIND THE BELL OF SAN TANCO. AND WE DID.
