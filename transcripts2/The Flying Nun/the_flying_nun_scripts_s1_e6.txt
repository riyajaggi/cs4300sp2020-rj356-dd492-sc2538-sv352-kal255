 The Flying Nun (1967â€“1970): Season 1, Episode 6 - Flight of the Dodo Bird - full transcript 
 On a flight, Sister Bertrille suddenly gets dizzy and has double vision, forcing a crash landing. After being checked out by Dr. Tapia, he discovers she has an ear infection that will clear up in a couple of days. He is more concerned about the condition of the Reverend Mother. She is a bit anxious about Sister Bertrille in general but more so now with Sister Bertrille's ailment. The doctor however attributes the Reverend Mother's anxiety to work stress and thus calls in Father Lundigan, the church's psychologist, to allay the Reverend Mother's anxiety. The Reverend Mother makes the mistake of telling Father Lundigan that the source of her anxiety is the flying nun, or rather the landings of the flying nun. The father promptly thinks the Reverend Mother is going crazy. Perhaps it's something in the water at the convent Sister Jacqueline and Sister Bertrille herself support the Reverend Mother's story. The only way to convince Father Lundigan is for Sister Bertrille to fly for him. However her ear infection is causing Sister Bertrille to be grounded. One by one, all the sisters support the Reverend Mother's story. Father Lundigan thinks he's surrounded by a convent full of deranged nuns, this further supported when the sisters try everything in their power to keep the father at the convent until Sister Bertrille's ear infection clears and she can fly again for the father. Father Lundigan manages to "escape" from the convent just as soon as Sister Bertrille's infection clears and she's able to fly again. Sister Bertrille finally manages to convince Father Lundigan when she flies next to the airborne plane which he's aboard. Or perhaps she's only convinced him that he's as crazy as all the nuns at the convent.

 AND, WHEN THE WIND IS RIGHT, SHE JUST, UH, FLIES. UNDERSTANDABLY, THIS UNUSUAL TALENT PRESENTS SOME UNUSUAL PROBLEMS TO OUR CONVENT AND TO SISTER BERTRILLE. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE SUNNY AFTERNOON, WHEN SHE WAS MAKING A ROUTINE LANDING AFTER AN INNOCENT JOYRIDE AROUND THE CONVENT, SHE ENCOUNTERED SOME STRANGE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. I WAS WITH THE REVEREND MOTHER IN HER OFFICE WHEN SISTER BERTRILLE MADE HER 2ND CRASH LANDING. [splashing] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M OK, I THINK. STILL A LITTLE DIZZY AND WORRIED.

 WORRIED? ABOUT WHAT, MY CHILD? I WAS AIMING AT THE BALCONY. (Jacqueline) SINCE SISTER BERTRILLE'S DIZZINESS PERSISTED, WE ASKED DR. TAPIA TO COME OUT TO THE CONVENT AND TAKE A LOOK AT HER. OF COURSE, UH, WE DID NOT TELL THE DOCTOR ABOUT SISTER BERTRILLE'S UNORTHODOX LANDING. WELL, DOCTOR, WILL I LIVE? I THINK SO. YOU HAVE AN INFECTION OF THE INNER EAR. THE INNER EAR? YES. THAT'S WHY YOUR SENSE OF BALANCE IS AFFECTED. IT SHOULD CLEAR UP IN A FEW DAYS. IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY DISCOMFORT, TAKE THESE. DISCOMFORT? YEAH, THAT'S THE WORD DOCTORS USE FOR EXCRUCIATING PAIN. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED TO KNOW, DOCTOR? OH, I DON'T THINK SO. AND JUST TRY TO AVOID ANYTHING STRENUOUS FOR A FEW DAYS. THERE IS ONE THING THAT COULD BE BAD FOR YOU. YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON FLYING ANYWHERE, ARE YOU? YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? ABOUT WHAT? THAT I FLY. UH, NO. IT, UH, WAS JUST A WILD GUESS. YOU MEAN YOU CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT ME? I DON'T THINK IT WAS A PARTICULARLY BRILLIANT DEDUCTION. MOST PEOPLE DO THESE DAYS, YOU KNOW. I THINK DR. TAPIA WAS TALKING ABOUT FLYING IN AN AIRPLANE, SISTER. IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY? WELL, IF THERE IS, IT'S PROBABLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. WHILE I'M OUT HERE, I THOUGHT I'D PAY A VISIT TO MOTHER SUPERIOR PLACIDO. I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT HER. WHY IS THAT, DOCTOR? THE LAST TIME I SAW HER SHE SEEMED TENSE, NERVOUS. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY REASON THAT COULD BE CAUSING THAT, SISTER JACQUELINE? WELL, THINGS HAVE BEEN A BIT UP IN THE AIR AROUND HERE LATELY. WELL, MAYBE IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY WERE BROUGHT DOWN TO EARTH AGAIN. (Jacqueline) UNFORTUNATELY, THE EXPERIENCES OF THE MORNING HAD SOMEWHAT UNNERVED THE REVEREND MOTHER AND HER MEETING WITH DR. TAPIA DIDN'T ALLAY HIS CONCERN ONE BIT. THERE YOU ARE, GET THEM IN THE MAIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WHAT IS IT, SISTER ANA? EXCUSE ME, REVEREND MOTHER, BUT I BELIEVE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE PEN, AND I GET THE LETTERS. OH, YES, OF COURSE. UH, I'M SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING, DOCTOR. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I WAS JUST LOOKING AT YOUR FOUNTAIN. THAT'S QUITE AN UNUSUAL ORNAMENT YOU HAVE. OH, DEAR, IS SHE IN IT AGAIN? WHO? SISTER BERTRILLE, OF COURSE. THERE'S NO ONE THERE, REVEREND MOTHER. [sighing] OH. I'M SORRY FOR ALARMING YOU, DOCTOR, BUT SISTER BERTRILLE DID DIVE INTO THE FOUNTAIN THIS MORNING. ON PURPOSE? OF COURSE NOT. SHE WAS AIMING AT THE BALCONY. I MEAN, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. HOW IS SISTER BERTRILLE? I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU. IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU, REVEREND MOTHER? BOTHERING ME? OF COURSE NOT. THEN WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SHARPEN YOUR PEN? (Jacqueline) DR. TAPIA'S MEETING WITH THE REVEREND MOTHER ENCOURAGED HIM TO WRITE TO THE MOTHER PROVINCIAL AT THE MOTHER HOUSE EXPRESSING HIS CONCERN AND SUGGESTING THAT THE REVEREND MOTHER NEEDED PROFESSIONAL HELP. AND THAT'S HOW FATHER LUNDIGAN, ALONG WITH HIS CRISP, NEW DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY, HAPPENED TO COME TO THE CONVENT SAN TANCO. HE WAS TO REMEMBER HIS VISIT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. OOPS! ALMOST MADE IT THAT TIME. I'VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR 3 DAYS. I'M GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME. THAT MUST BE VERY, UH, REWARDING FOR YOU? YEAH, WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN WALKING INTO BRICK WALLS, FATHER. THAT HURTS. I SUPPOSE IT DOES. OH. OH, WELL, YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN SICK. MY, UH, MY 3RD EAR WENT ON THE BLINK. I'M SORRY. I... I HOPE YOU GET BETTER SOON. OH, WELL, I FEEL FINE. THE HEADACHES HAVE GONE, AND I'M SURE THE OTHER WILL CLEAR UP SOON. OH, MAY I... MAY I HELP YOU, FATHER? IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE? OH, OH, UH, YES. I'M, UH, LOOKING FOR MOTHER SUPERIOR PLACIDO'S OFFICE. OH, WELL, YOU GO THROUGH THAT ARCH, INTO THE FOYER, AND IT'S THE FIRST DOOR ON THE RIGHT. THANK YOU. (Bertrille) UH, MAYBE TOMORROW, I'LL TRY IT WITHOUT A NET. [Bertrille laughing] WELL, OF COURSE, WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO WELCOME YOU AT THE CONVENT SAN TANCO, FATHER LUNDIGAN. BUT, UH, I'M PUZZLED AS TO THE PURPOSE OF YOUR VISIT. WE HAVE NO NEED OF A PSYCHOLOGIST HERE. I CAME TO SEE YOU, REVEREND MOTHER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. DR. TAPIA WROTE THE MOTHER PROVINCIAL, AND STATED THAT YOU WERE SUFFERING AN ANXIETY REACTION, PROBABLY MOTIVATED BY A TENSION-FILLED SCHEDULE, WHICH IN TURN HAS TRIGGERED HEIGHTENED INTERNAL CONFLICTS. AND THESE CONFLICTS HAVE MANIFESTED THEMSELVES BY A TENDENCY TO, UH, OVERREACT TO VARIOUS LIFE SITUATIONS. DR. TAPIA SAID ALL THAT? WELL, I'VE PARAPHRASED IT A BIT. WHAT EXACTLY DID HE SAY? THAT YOU SEEM NERVOUS. AND YOU ASSUMED THAT I NEEDED PSYCHIATRIC HELP? WELL, DR. TAPIA FELT THAT YOU AND I MIGHT ESTABLISH NEW CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION BY YOUR VERBALIZING YOUR PROBLEMS, AND THAT HOPEFULLY WE WOULD EFFECT A SATISFACTORY ADJUSTMENT. PLEASE, FATHER. YOU MEAN, HE FELT THAT I NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO? YOU COULD PUT IT THAT WAY. YOU KNOW, THIS IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS. OF COURSE, I... I DO HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT I KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. AND BELIEVE ME, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STATE OF MY MENTAL HEALTH. WHAT PROBLEM IS THAT, REVEREND MOTHER? [sighing] WELL, FATHER LUNDIGAN, I SUPPOSE I'D BETTER TELL YOU. WE HAVE A NOVICE AT THE CONVENT WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO FLY. AH, SHE'S A PILOT? OH, NO. SHE FLIES ON HER OWN. YOU KNOW, LIKE A PELICAN. MAYBE YOU'D BETTER TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT, REVEREND MOTHER. WELL, THAT'S ABOUT ALL THERE IS. Y-YOU SEE, SHE DOESN'T WEIGH MUCH, AND SHE JUST SORT OF GLIDES ALONG ON THE AIRWAYS. [sighs] I, PERSONALLY, DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE TECHNICALITIES. YOU HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN HER FLY? OF COURSE. IT'S NOT REALLY HER FLYING THAT CONCERNS ME. NO? NO. IT'S HER LANDINGS. S-SHE'S HAD 1 OR 2 CLOSE CALLS ALREADY, AND IT'S... IT'S A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME. I CAN IMAGINE. I... I THOUGHT AT FIRST OF GROUNDING HER, BUT SHE SEEMS TO GET SUCH PLEASURE FROM IT THAT, WELL, SOMEHOW IT DIDN'T SEEM FAIR. YOU UNDERSTAND? OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND, REVEREND MOTHER. TELL ME, IS THERE, UH, ANY PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT WHEN YOU SEE THIS NUN FLYING? I MEAN, UH, DO YOU SEE HER ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES? YES. WHEN THE WIND IS GUSTY. WHEN THE WIND IS GUSTY. UH, OF COURSE, I DON'T USUALLY TELL PEOPLE ABOUT OUR FLYING NUN. BUT YOU'VE COME SUCH A LONG WAY THAT I FELT YOU WERE ENTITLED TO SOME SORT OF EXPLANATION. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONFIDENCE, REVEREND MOTHER. WELL, NOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INNER WORKINGS OF MY MIND, I, UH, HOPE YOU'RE NOT DISAPPOINTED, FATHER. NO, REVEREND MOTHER. NO. NO, I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL. YOUR ROOM IS IN THE OTHER WING, FATHER LUNDIGAN. THANK YOU. HOW LONG WILL YOU BE STAYING WITH US? OH, LONGER THAN I EXPECTED, I'M AFRAID. SISTER JACQUELINE? YES. YOU'VE KNOWN REVEREND MOTHER FOR A LONG TIME, HAVEN'T YOU? UH, 20 YEARS. WHY? WELL, UH, SINCE I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP, I... I THINK IT MIGHT BE ADVISABLE TO TAKE YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE. UH, PERHAPS YOU BETTER SIT DOWN. YEAH. [birds chirping] DO YOU KNOW REVEREND MOTHER'S SEEN A FLYING NUN? YES, I DO. OF COURSE, I KNOW THE REASON SHE'S SEEN THIS NUN FLYING. YOU DO? OH, YES. REVEREND MOTHER HAS A SUBCONSCIOUS DESIRE TO... TO BE THAT... THAT... THAT FLYING NUN. UP THERE IN THE SKY, FREE AS A BIRD, STRIPPED OF ALL THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND, UH, CONFLICTS INHERENT IN EVERYDAY LIFE SITUATIONS. WELL, THAT'S A VERY ASTUTE OBSERVATION, FATHER. THANK YOU. HOWEVER, THERE'S ONE THING WRONG WITH IT. WHAT'S THAT? WE REALLY DO HAVE A FLYING NUN HERE. ALTHOUGH IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO MAKE POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS, PERHAPS WE'RE DEALING WITH A UNIQUE DISORIENTATION EPIDEMIC. THE 3 MEMBERS OF THE CONVENT I'VE MET THUS FAR, ALL SEEM TO BE SUFFERING FROM SYMPTOMS OF DERANGED PERSONALITIES AND... [knocking on door] YES, UH, COME IN. THE REVEREND MOTHER WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME TO HER OFFICE, FATHER LUNDIGAN. THANK YOU, SISTER. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. TO BE CONTINUED... (Rev. Mother) FATHER LUNDIGAN, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU BELIEVE I AM HAVING HALLUCINATIONS. THAT'S, UH, AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION, REVEREND MOTHER. A-AS A PSYCHOLOGIST... EXCUSE ME, FATHER, BUT YOU WERE INVITED HERE TO PUT AN END TO THIS NONSENSE. [door opens] REVEREND MOTHER, YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? THERE. DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AN HALLUCINATION? NO. THAT'S THE YOUNG LADY I MET EARLIER. HI. I'M SISTER BERTRILLE. SISTER BERTRILLE IS THE ONE WHO FLIES, FATHER. IS, UH, IS THAT THE ONE YOU SEE FLYING, SISTER? WELL, OF COURSE. THERE'S ONLY ONE. DO YOU BELIEVE YOU FLY? WELL, FATHER, ONCE YOU'VE DONE IT, IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN FORGET. WHEN DID YOU FIRST BELIEVE YOU COULD FLY? WHEN I FIRST DID. UH, FLEW, THAT IS. (Lundigan) AND, UH, WHERE DO YOU GO ON THESE FLIGHTS? OH, UP AND AROUND. I SEE. (Rev. Mother) AND I SEE THAT WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME. OBVIOUSLY, FATHER LUNDIGAN DOESN'T BELIEVE A WORD THAT WE'RE SAYING. UH, SISTER BERTRILLE, DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD ARRANGE TO FLY FOR FATHER LUNDIGAN? WELL, I... I GUESS I CAN GIVE IT A WHIRL. BUT ARE THE WINDS GUSTY ENOUGH, SISTER? (Bertrille) YEAH, ENOUGH TO GET ME OFF THE GROUND. (Jacqueline) WELL, ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE AIRWORTHY, SISTER BERTRILLE? (Bertrille) OH, I'M SURE. I JUST WALKED THE CHALK LINE PERFECTLY. I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING FANCY LIKE AN IMMELMANN, OR A LOOP-THE-LOOP. BUT I'M SURE I CAN MANAGE A ROUTINE TAKEOFF AND ONCE AROUND THE CONVENT. WOULD THAT BE SUFFICIENT, FATHER? OH, YES, YES, YES. QUITE SUFFICIENT, THANK YOU. (Jacqueline) NOW, YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? WE WOULDN'T WANT TO SEND YOU UP WITH FAULTY EQUIPMENT. DON'T GIVE IT ANOTHER THOUGHT. MY 3RD EAR'S BEEN BEHAVING VERY WELL. UH, FATHER, YOU ARE WILLING TO WATCH THE DEMONSTRATION? OH, YES, YES. UH, IT, UH, MIGHT BE VERY THERAPEUTIC. THERAPEUTIC? WELL, SOMETIMES, UH, ACTING OUT A FANTASY... FATHER LUNDIGAN, THIS IS NO FANTASY. SISTER BERTRILLE, GO PUT ON YOUR WINGS. I MEAN YOUR CORNET. THIS IS SISTER BERTRILLE'S LAUNCHING PAD. THANK YOU. ARE YOUR READY TO TAKEOFF, SISTER? CONTACT. [crashing] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? FINE. I... I... I LOST MY BALANCE. (both) SHE LOST HER BALANCE. ARE YOU SURE IT'LL WORK? I'M SURE. THIS'LL GIVE ME JUST THE EXTRA BOOST I NEED. I'M READY, FATHER LUNDIGAN. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO TRY THIS, SISTER? OF COURSE. WE CAN'T HAVE YOU GOING AWAY THINKING WE'RE ALL A BUNCH OF DING-A-LINGS, CAN WE? [crashing] [hen clucking] I... I FELL IN THE HEN HOUSE. (Bertrille) OK, KIDS, GO. [children screaming] [crashing] AND I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE 3 PATIENTS BE PLACED IN A REST HOME, BE GIVEN INTENSIVE TREATMENT. [knocking on door] COME... THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME DINNER, FATHER. OH, THANK YOU. BET YOU ARE HUNGRY ENOUGH TO EAT A HOUSE. YEAH... A HORSE? NO. THIS IS LAMB. YOU LIKE HORSE? OH, NO, NO. I, UH... LAMB'S MY FAVORITE DISH. OH, THEN WE BANGED THE JACKPOT. MOST DAYS IT'S STEW OF THE IRISH. GO AHEAD, FATHER. DON'T SIT ON CEREMONY. AH, IT SMELLS DELICIOUS. THINGS ARE LOOKING UP. SI, AND WE'RE ALL PRAYING FOR OUR LITTLE BIRD. AH, YES, YOU MEAN SISTER BERTRILLE? SHE HAS SOMETHING WRONG IN HER HEAD. YOU... YOU KNOW THAT? OF COURSE. EVERYBODY DOES. [laughing] I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT. OTHERWISE, SHE COULD FLY LIKE EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS. YOU MEAN, UH, YOU BELIEVE SHE FLIES, TOO? HAVE I LET THE CAT OUT OF THE SACK? OH, NO, NO, NO. IT'S PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT, SISTER. EAT IN GOOD HEALTH, FATHER. THANK YOU. MAKE THAT 4 PATIENTS. [knocking on door] COME IN. OH, EXCUSE ME, FATHER, BUT SISTER BERTRILLE WOULD LIKE YOU TO LOOK OUT OF YOUR WINDOW. HI, THERE! UH, ONE MORE TIME! OK, KIDS, HIT THE FANS! IT'S ALL A DREAM. IT'S PART OF A TERRIBLE NIGHTMARE. EVEN THE FANS WILL NOT MAKE SISTER BERTRILLE FLY. OF COURSE NOT. NOTHING THEY HAVE DONE WILL HELP. NO? NO. SISTER BERTRILLE FLIES BECAUSE SHE'S A SAINT. CALL ME A TAXI, SISTER. I BETTER GET OUT OF HERE. IF HE LEAVES NOW, WE'LL ALL END UP IN THE FUNNY FARM. WE HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY TO KEEP HIM HERE UNTIL TOMORROW. AND THEN WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO FLY THEN. MY BALANCE IS GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME. IF ONLY I... WHAT IS IT, SISTER? HAVE YOU ORDERED THE TAXI YET? NO. GOOD. TELL FATHER LUNDIGAN I'LL DRIVE HIM TO THE AIRPORT. BUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM IN OUR CAR? IT'S MORE UNRELIABLE. YOU DIDN'T TAMPER WITH THE CAR, DID YOU, SISTER? OF COURSE NOT, THAT WOULD BE DISHONEST. BESIDES, IT'S USUALLY CAPABLE OF NOT STARTING WITHOUT MY TAMPERING. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO? WELL, A LITTLE PRAYER MIGHT HELP. IT REALLY WASN'T NECESSARY FOR YOU TO DRIVE ME TO THE AIRPORT. YES, IT WAS, FATHER. WELL, CAN WE GET STARTED? I HAVE... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PRAYING. SOMETIMES IT HELPS. YOU DO HAVE YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE, DON'T YOU? OH, SURE. I DRIVE ALMOST AS WELL AS I FLY. WELL, LET'S GET GOING. I DON'T LIKE... WHY ARE THEY ALL PRAYING? IT PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR JOURNEY, FATHER. WELL, START THE CAR, PLEASE. [engine chugging] IT STARTED. TURNING THE IGNITION WILL USUALLY DO THAT. SISTER, PLEASE, I DON'T WANT TO MISS MY PLANE. [tire bursting] THANKS. WHAT WAS THAT? SOUNDED LIKE A FLAT. [nuns clapping] WHERE'S THE NEAREST PHONE? IN THE REVEREND MOTHER'S OFFICE. WHY? I'M GONNA PHONE FOR A TAXI. WHAT NOW? OH! I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING. REVEREND MOTHER. SISTER BERTRILLE, WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS? DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A NICE GESTURE IF WE INVITED FATHER LUNDIGAN TO STAY OVERNIGHT AND CELEBRATE EARLY MASS FOR US? SISTER BERTRILLE, FATHER GONZAGA ALWAYS CELEBRATES EARLY MASS. WELL, I KNOW... I KNOW, BUT DON'T YOU THINK FATHER GONZAGA WOULD APPRECIATE THE DAY OFF? AND FATHER LUNDIGAN, HE COULD SEE ME FLY. FATHER LUNDIGAN, I HAVE A REQUEST TO MAKE OF YOU. I TRIED TO REFUSE BUT REVEREND MOTHER WAS QUITE INSISTENT, AND, KNOWING THE STATE OF HER MENTAL HEALTH, I DIDN'T DARE SAY NO. MAYBE... MAYBE IT'S MY IMAGINATION, BUT I HAVE A STRANGE FEELING THAT I'M BEING HELD PRISONER HERE. NO, NO, NO, NO. STRIKE THAT LAST REMARK. I... I... I'VE SEEN MANY STRANGE THINGS TODAY, BUT I... I CAN'T POSSIBLY BELIEVE THAT... THAT... [door lock clicking] IT'S NOT MY IMAGINATION. I'M BEING HELD PRISONER BY A GROUP OF DERANGED NUNS. I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. WELL, I'LL SAY GOOD NIGHT NOW, RECORDER! TIME TO GET SOME SLEEP, SO I CAN BE FRESH AND ALERT TOMORROW MORNING. (Lundigan) AFTER ALL, I WANT TO BE BRIGHT AND FRESH TO CELEBRATE EARLY MASS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THAT? WHO KNOWS? HE'S THE PSYCHOLOGIST. I'M GETTING OUT MY PAJAMAS NOW, RECORDER. THEN IT'S BEDTIME. POOR MAN. HE... HE MUST BE TERRIBLY LONELY. (Lundigan) WELL, GOOD NIGHT, RECORDER. WELL, HE SEEMS TO HAVE SETTLED DOWN FOR THE NIGHT. [sighs] [crickets chirping] IT'S ALL COME BACK. SISTER BERTRILLE. WHERE ARE YOU, SISTER? I'M UP HERE. I CAN FLY AGAIN! ISN'T THAT MARVELOUS? OH! HE'S GONE. FATHER LUNDIGAN'S FLOWN THE COOP. WHAT? HE CAN'T. I'M AIRWORTHY. I'M AFRAID IT'S TOO LATE. NOT NECESSARILY. IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU'LL GET WRITER'S CRAMP, FATHER. I ALWAYS INTEND TO USE THE TIME ON THE PLANE CATCHING UP WITH MY LETTER-WRITING, BUT SOMEHOW I NEVER GET AROUND TO IT. OH, THIS ISN'T A LETTER. IT'S A REPORT. I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST. WELL, I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED WE'D BE IN THE SAME LINE OF WORK. I'M A PSYCHIATRIST. OH, REALLY? DR. NORMAN LOOMIS. I PRACTICE IN NEW ORLEANS. OH, HOW DO YOU DO? HAVE YOU BEEN ON A VACATION IN SAN JUAN, FATHER? OH, NO, NO, NO. I'VE BEEN WORKING. UH, YOU KNOW, DOCTOR, I-I'M INVOLVED IN A CASE THAT'S GOING TO END UP IN EVERY MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL IN THE WORLD. REALLY? YES, UH, YOU SEE, I... I WAS VISITING A CONVENT OF NUNS IN SAN JUAN AND... AND MAY... MAY I SHOW YOU MY NOTES? YES, OF COURSE. EXCUSE ME. I'LL GET RID OF THIS. YOU WERE SAYING, FATHER? OH, NOTHING, NOTHING. DOCTOR, UH, THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO KNOW. YES, WHAT'S THAT, FATHER? IF... IF... IF A PSYCHOLOGIST BECAME A PATIENT OF YOURS, WOULD YOU GIVE HIM A PROFESSIONAL DISCOUNT? [children singing] YOU'RE NOT ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE I WROTE TO THE MOTHER PROVINCIAL, ARE YOU? NO, DOCTOR. I KNOW YOU MEANT WELL. YOU WANTED TO SEE SISTER BERTRILLE? OH, YES. I WANT TO CHECK THAT EAR INFECTION. HERE IS HER ROOM. UH, HOW DOES SHE SEEM? OH, SHE'S COMPLETELY BACK TO NORMAL. (children) â™ª ...BE ON MY WAY, I'M ON MY WAY â™ª â™ª I'M ON MY WAY â™ª â™ª HELLO, MISSES TELLAMUFFIN, HOW ARE YOU TODAY â™ª â™ª THANK YOU, MA'AM, I'M VERY WELL, I MUST BE ON MY WAY â™ª â™ª I'M ON MY WAY â™ª â™ª I'M ON MY WAY â™ª â™ª HELLO, FREDDY SPOTTED PUPPY, HOW ARE YOU TODAY â™ª THAT IS NORMAL?
