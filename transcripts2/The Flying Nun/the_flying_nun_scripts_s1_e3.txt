 The Flying Nun (1967â€“1970): Season 1, Episode 3 - Old Cars for New - full transcript 
 Even mechanically inclined Sister Bertrille can't fix their jalopy of a station wagon, which they need to transport the children to the Feast of St. Anthony Carnival that day. The sisters talk the Reverend Mother into letting them trade in the jalopy and buy another used car with the $800 they have on hand. Sister Bertrille turns to Money Back Hernando, the most notorious used car dealer in San Juan. They strike a deal for a station wagon for $800, plus the trade-in. The new car ends up being a lemon. But luckily, it breaks down next to where Carlos is picnicking with his latest conquest, Diane. He manages to fix it to the best of his ability, but he suggests the sister take the car back to Hernando and get her money back. Money Back is not true to his name, and they negotiate $500 for the buy-back, but she has to come back later for the money. Vehicleless, Sister Bertrille talks Carlos into letting her use his station wagon to drive the children to the carnival. So Sister Bertrille drops Carlos' station wagon off at the convent, and tells the kids to tell the other sisters that she'll be back shortly and will explain the situation, while she heads back into town to pick up the $500. The sisters see the beautiful station wagon and assume it's the one Sister Bertrille bought with the $800. However just as the kids go off, the water heater in the convent falls apart, and they're going to need the $800 back. So Sister Jacqueline takes Carlos' car back to Money Back and sells it to him for $800. Money Back, never one to pass up a good deal however shady, agrees despite not knowing anything about Sister Jacqueline's story but indeed knowing that the car is well worth more than $800. He turns around and lists it for $1,500. So Sister Bertrille needs to go to Carlos to ask for a loan of $1,000, which added to her $500 will allow her to buy his car back. She is reluctant to tell him what she needs the money for, and he explodes when he finds out the reason. However, he comes up with a plan. Sister Bertrille is to go back and buy the old jalopy from Money Back, which she does for $15. Then Carlos goes to Money Back asking to buy the jalopy, implying that a wealthy investor is in town looking for old vehicles such as that and paying a fortune for such. So Carlos and Money Back go to the convent to bid on the jalopy. Money Back eventually buys it back for $3,000, at which time Carlos infers that the investor, while real, is not in town nor might he ever be. Money Back realizes that he has been had at his own game.

 [barking] (Jacqueline) THIS IS THE CONVENT SAN TANCO IN SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO. UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE WERE MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER TEACHING ORDER. THAT WAS WHEN SISTER BERTRILLE CAME TO JOIN US. THINGS HAVE NEVER BEEN QUITE THE SAME SINCE. YOU SEE, SISTER BERTRILLE FLIES. OH, NOT IN AN AIRPLANE. SHE ONLY WEIGHS 90 POUNDS AND WHEN THE WIND IS RIGHT, SHE JUST... FLIES. HER TALENTS ARE NOT LIMITED TO AEROBATICS. SHE ALSO HAS A GIFT FOR MECHANICS,

 A BLESSING AS FAR AS OUR STATION WAGON IS CONCERNED. ON THE DAY WE HAD PROMISED TO TAKE THE CHILDREN TO THE FEAST OF SAINT ANTHONY CARNIVAL, SISTER BERTRILLE FOUND HERSELF, ONCE AGAIN, TRYING TO COAX IT INTO ACTION. OK, TRY HER AGAIN. [engine sputtering] WHAT DO WE DO NOW? I DON'T KNOW. I'VE TIGHTENED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TOO LOOSE, AND LOOSENED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TOO TIGHT. SISTER, THE CAR, SHE CRANK OUT AGAIN, NO? THE CAR, SHE CONK OUT AGAIN, YES. BUT DON'T WORRY, KIDS, WE'LL GET IT STARTED. I REPEAT, SISTER.

 WHAT DO WE DO NOW? WE GET OURSELVES A NEW STATION WAGON, THAT'S WHAT WE DO NOW. SISTERS, UH, THE CONVENT HAS NO MONEY FOR SUCH AN EXTRAVAGANCE AS... AS A NEW CAR. BUT, REVEREND MOTHER, BELIEVE ME, THIS IS ONE EXTRAVAGANCE THAT'S A... A NECESSITY. THAT OLD CAR, SHE'S A REAL CLUNKER. CLINKER, SISTER. THIS MORNING, IT WILL NOT START AT ALL. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THE CHILDREN TO THE CARNIVAL. THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS HOLIDAY FOR WEEKS. HOW CAN WE DISAPPOINT THEM? AND WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY A NEW CAR. NO, WE CAN TAKE OUR OLD STATION WAGON AND TRADE IT IN ON A GOOD USED CAR, FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY. SISTERS, WE... WE HAVE ONLY ABOUT $800 PUT BY. WELL, WHY NOT LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE? I MEAN, THERE HASN'T BEEN AN EMERGENCY AROUND HERE FOR AS LONG AS ANYONE CAN REMEMBER. AND EVEN BEFORE THAT. SO WHY SHOULD THERE EVER BE? (Jacqueline) AND THAT, AFTER A FASHION, WAS HOW SISTER BERTRILLE NEGOTIATED HER FIRST DEAL. THE NEXT WAS WITH "MONEY BACK" HERNANDO. THE MOST HONEST USED CAR DEALER IN ALL OF SAN JUAN. STILL TOO MUCH. AH. TODAY IS YOUR LUCKY DAY. MY CREDITORS HAVE ME AGAINST THE WALL. $900. $850. $825. SENOR HERNANDO, YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT MY TRADE-IN YET. WELL, THAT IS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU ARE SO DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO IT. I WILL GIVE YOU $25. IT'S A DEAL. [engine backfiring] (Jacqueline) SISTER BERTRILLE SOON LEARNED THAT DRIVING A BARGAIN IS ONE THING, BUT DRIVING WHAT YOU BARGAINED FOR IS SOMETHING ELSE. [sighing] AFTER ALL THAT, DON'T TELL ME I WOUND UP WITH A STINKER. WE SHOULD DRINK TO THE FATE THAT MADE OUR PATHS CROSS. OR TO THE TRAVEL FOLDERS THAT ENTICED ME TO COME TO PUERTO RICO FOR MY VACATION. WE'LL DRINK TO THEM, TOO. THEN WE WILL LUNCH. AND THEN... AND THEN? THEN WE'LL SPEND THE HOURS BLISSFULLY, JUST THE TWO OF US. ALONE. CARLOS, YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT, BUT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL IN WISCONSIN, WELL, I, I JUST HATED TO GO ON PICNICS BECAUSE SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENED TO SPOIL THEM. NOTHING CAN SPOIL THE BLISS OF THIS MOMENT, MY DARLING. [moaning] CARLOS, THERE'S SOMEONE HERE, STANDING RIGHT BEHIND YOU. OH, NO. NO, IT CAN'T BE. NOT HERE. NOT NOW... CARLOS, HI. I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND YOU HERE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE DIFFERENT, SISTER BERTRILLE. I'VE COME TO EXPECT YOU TO FIND ME HERE AND EVERYWHERE. THIS IS SISTER BERTRILLE, CONVENT SAN TANCO. HOW DO YOU DO? HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKS. SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE A LITTLE ANGEL STANDING THERE. OH, YES. AND SHE WILL SPREAD HER WINGS AND GO AWAY QUICKLY LIKE A GOOD LITTLE ANGEL. WON'T YOU, SISTER BERTRILLE? WELL, NO. I... I MEAN, YES. IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF HELP. YOU SEE, I BOUGHT THIS STATION WAGON TODAY, AND IT BROKE DOWN ON THE ROAD JUST NEAR HERE. AND YOU WANT ME TO FIX IT? WELL, I TRIED, BUT I CAN'T. DIANE, PLEASE FORGIVE ME. YOU WON'T BE LONG, WILL YOU, CARLOS? OH, NO, HE'LL BE BACK IN A JIFFY. IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT COULD BE FIXED WITH A LITTLE TWIST OF THE WRIST. THIS IS THE BEST I CAN DO. TRY IT. OK. [engine starting] OH, IT'S FINE. THANK YOU, CARLOS. [gears grating] ONLY THING IS THE GEAR SHIFT IS STUCK IN REVERSE. WELL, THAT'S THE WAY YOU'LL HAVE TO DRIVE IT. IN REVERSE. WELL, I CAN'T DRIVE A CAR BACKWARDS. WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE, IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT. NOW, TELL ME ONE THING. WHO DID YOU BUY THIS CAR FROM? WELL, HIS NAME IS MONEY-BACK-HERNANDO. AND HE'S THE MOST HONEST USED CAR DEALER IN ALL OF SAN JUAN, I KNOW. WOULD YOU TAKE MY ADVICE? YOU GO BACK TO MONEY-BACK, AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK. THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO, JUST AS FAST AS THIS CRATE WILL GET ME THERE. [car horn honking] YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU $800 FOR A CAR THAT DOES NOT WORK? SISTER, [clicking tongue] THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO DO BUSINESS. I'LL SAY IT ISN'T. I'M GLAD YOU AGREE. I WILL GIVE YOU $500 FOR THE CAR. I GAVE YOU $800. OH, SISTER, SURELY I AM ENTITLED TO A LEGITIMATE PROFIT? I HAVE TO HAVE THAT MONEY. IT BELONGS TO THE CONVENT. AND FOR THE SAKE OF THE CONVENT, I AM WILLING TO GIVE IT TO YOU. $500. [sighs] I'LL TAKE IT. I HAVE TO. MAY I HAVE IT, PLEASE? THE VERY MINUTE MY ASSISTANT RETURNS FROM THE BANK. WHAT DOES YOUR ASSISTANT HAVE TO DO WITH IT? HE WENT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT. BUT, SISTER, I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. WHAT? WHY NOT DO THIS WITHOUT EXCHANGING ANY CASH AT ALL. HMM? I MEAN, YOU STILL NEED A STATION WAGON, DON'T YOU? NEVER MIND, SENOR HERNANDO. I HAVE TO GO NOW, BUT I'LL BE BACK REAL SOON, SO PLEASE HAVE MY MONEY READY. HERNANDO IS A MAN OF HIS WORD. BUT, SISTER, UH, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW? SENOR MONEY-BACK, EVEN IF YOU SAW IT, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. HAPPY? MMM-HMM. BUT ALSO A LITTLE SAD. WHY, MY DARLING? BECAUSE WE'LL PROBABLY NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN AFTER I GO HOME. OH, I'D FOLLOW YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. [laughing] NO, YOU WON'T. YOU'LL FORGET ME JUST LIKE YOU HAVE SO MANY OTHER GIRLS. OH, FOOLISH GIRL. HOW CAN I FORGET A SUBLIME MOMENT LIKE THIS? HI, I'M BACK. OH, WHY ME? WHY ME? WHAT HAVE I DONE? I'M... I'M SORRY TO BUST IN ON YOU TWO LIKE THIS AGAIN, BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT. OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T HELP IT, SISTER BERTRILLE. IT IS PREORDAINED THAT WE MEET IN STRANGE, OUT OF THE WAY PLACES. CARLOS, I NEED ANOTHER FAVOR. WHAT NOW? WELL, I TOOK YOUR ADVICE, AND I GOT RID OF THAT NO-GOOD HEAP THAT I BOUGHT. AW, I'M OVERJOYED. AND NOW I WONDERED IF I COULD BORROW YOUR STATION WAGON. MY STATION WAGON? JUST FOR A SECOND. YOU SEE, THE KIDS ARE WAITING TO BE TAKEN TO THE CARNIVAL. I PROMISE, I'LL BE BACK IN A JIFFY. OF COURSE YOU WILL BE BACK, SISTER BERTRILLE, IT IS INEVITABLE. PLEASE, TAKE THE CAR. OH, THANK YOU, CARLOS. YOU'RE A REAL GOOD EGG. THANK YOU. HAVE FUN, YOU TWO. [children chattering] (Bertrille) THANK YOU. UH, HEY, CHARLIE. YES, SISTER? ARE YOU GOING INTO TOWN? THAT'S RIGHT. GREAT. WILL YOU GIVE ME A LIFT? OK. BUT STEP ON IT. I'M IN A BIG HURRY. OK, I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. NOW, KIDS, KIDS, COME HERE. I HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO WAIT FOR THE OTHER SISTERS, SO I WANT YOU TO GIVE THEM A MESSAGE FOR ME, OK? OK. OK. OK. NOW, TELL THEM TO DRIVE YOU INTO THE VILLAGE AND THEN BRING THE STATION WAGON RIGHT BACK, PRONTO. AND THAT I'LL GIVE THEM THE SCOOP ON EVERYTHING LATER, WHEN I GET BACK. OK, YOU'VE GOT IT? WE'VE GOT IT. OK, SISTER, LET'S GO. OK. OK, I'M COMING. HAVE A GOOD TIME, AND DON'T FORGET MY MESSAGE. GOODBYE. GOODBYE. [station wagon horn honking] WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? SISTER BERTRILLE BROUGHT IT. SISTER BERTRILLE. WHERE IS SHE? SHE HAD TO GO IN A HURRY, SO SHE LEFT THIS CAR FOR US. REVEREND MOTHER. TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEW STATION WAGON. IT'S A MIRACLE. OH, FOR $800. YOU COULD SAY THAT AGAIN, SISTER. SISTER BERTRILLE, SHE'S SHARP AS A TICK. TACK, SISTER. OH, MY. (girl) IT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR. (boy) AND POWER STEERING. ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY IN. HAVE A GOOD TIME, CHILDREN. (boy #2) BYE. BYE-BYE. BYE. [pipe bursting] (Rev. Mother) OH, SISTER. WELL, IF IT HAD TO HAPPEN, THIS WAS THE PERFECT TIME FOR IT. JUST WHEN WE SPEND $800 FOR A NEW CAR. WELL, I'M AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO NEED THAT $800 NOW. AND MORE. I KNOW. SO BACK GOES THE STATION WAGON WHERE IT CAME FROM. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE SISTER BERTRILLE IS OR HOW LONG SHE'LL BE. OH, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT, AS SOON AS SISTER SIXTO RETURNS. OH, WAIT TILL SISTER BERTRILLE FINDS OUT WE HAD TO GET RID OF IT. SHE'LL FLIP. FLIP, SISTER JACQUELINE? FLIP, REVEREND MOTHER. YES, SISTER. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WELL, I... I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS, UH, SENOR HERNANDO. [stammering] IT'S A LOVELY CAR. OH, YES. AND ALL THE, UH, SISTERS AT THE CONVENT, AS WELL AS THE MOTHER SUPERIOR LIKE IT VERY MUCH. OH, THAT'S NICE. BUT, WE CAN'T KEEP IT. YOU... YOU CAN'T KEEP IT? NO. YOU SEE, WE NEED THE $800 MUCH MORE. YOU NEED THE $800 MUCH MORE. IN FACT, DESPERATELY, OR I WOULDN'T BE HERE. SO, IF YOU WOULD, UM, IF... IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND TAKING THE CAR AND GIVING ME THE MONEY. [stammering] NO, I WOULDN'T MIND. THE TIRES ARE, UH, WORN. AND THE ENGINE IS NOISY. BUT I WOULD BE GLAD TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY. OH, SENOR HERNANDO, YOU-YOU'RE A KIND AND GENEROUS MAN. WELL, I TRY TO BE, SISTER. I... I TRY TO BE. NOW STEP IN AND SEE MY CASHIER. THANK YOU. BUT, SISTER JACQUELINE CAN'T SELL OUR NEW STATION WAGON. AND WHY NOT? WELL, FOR ONE REASON, IT'S NOT OURS. SISTER BERTRILLE, WE DID SEND YOU TO SAN JUAN TO BUY A CAR. YES, AND I BOUGHT ONE. AND I STARTED TO DRIVE IT BACK HERE, AND IT CONKED OUT. I HAD TO DRIVE IT ALL THE WAY BACK BACKWARDS TO "MONEY BACK," TO GET MY MONEY BACK. SISTER BERTRILLE, I AM SURE THAT IF YOU TRY VERY HARD, YOU WILL FIND A WAY TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT. I'M SORRY. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS, I DIDN'T BUY THE CAR THAT SISTER JACQUELINE IS SELLING. I BORROWED IT FROM CARLOS RAMIREZ. GOSH. A THING LIKE THIS COULD SPOIL HIS PICNIC. [thunder rumbling] I KNEW IT. I KNEW... SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME WHEN I GO ON A PICNIC. OH, COME ON, IT'S JUST A LITTLE SUMMER SHOWER, NOTHING TO BE UPSET ABOUT. [shrieking] I LOOK A MESS. TO CARLOS, YOU'RE MORE EXCITING THAN EVER. FUNNY. I DON'T FEEL VERY EXCITING. I FEEL LIKE I'M CATCHING A COLD. CARLOS, I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY HOTEL ROOM, NOW. WOULD YOU TAKE ME BACK? PLEASE TAKE ME. OK. IF YOU WISH. HOW? WHAT OTHER WAY IS THERE? I'M GOING TO WALK YOU BACK. GIVE ME A HAND HERE, PLEASE. [screaming] BUT, SENOR HERNANDO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW CAN SISTER JACQUELINE SELL YOU A CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN OWN IN THE SECOND PLACE. ALL I KNOW IS SHE CAME IN THIS PLACE, I BOUGHT THE CAR, IT BELONGS TO ME. HOW CAN IT? YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE REGISTRATION SLIP. THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I WANT THIS CAR. AND I WILL BE GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU GET IT. FOR $1,500. [sighs] SENOR HERNANDO, WHAT KIND OF A MAN ARE YOU? FIRST, YOU SELL ME A CAR FOR $800. AND THEN YOU BUY IT BACK FOR $500, MAKING $300. AND THEN YOU BUY A CAR FOR $800, AND TRY TO SELL IT FOR $1,500. AM I AHEAD OR BEHIND? TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO, I'LL GIVE YOU $500 NOW, AND THEN USE THE HERNANDO EASY PAYMENT PLAN WITH LOW, LOW INTEREST RATES FOR THE REST OF THE TIME. NOT WITH THIS CAR. I WANT THE REST NOW. $1,000. BUT WHERE AM I GOING TO GET $1,000? $1,000. GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY SHOULD I GIVE YOU $1,000. ONE GOOD REASON. JUST ONE. I NEED IT? IS THAT A GOOD REASON? WELL, I COULD DO WITH A FAVOR. SISTER BERTRILLE, HOW MANY DOES THAT MAKE TODAY? SISTER BERTRILLE, I'M... I'M PATIENT, KIND, AND VERY, VERY UNDERSTANDING. BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME TODAY? YOU RUINED MY DATE WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL. YOU MADE ME GET SOAKED IN THE RAIN. YOU MADE ME WALK ALL THE WAY BACK TO TOWN IN A PAIR OF BRAND NEW SHOES. YOU BORROWED MY STATION WAGON. YOU DID BRING IT BACK? WELL, THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. WHAT IS? WHY I NEED $1,000. YOU SEE, SISTER JACQUELINE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOUR CAR WHEN SHE SOLD IT. SISTER JACQUELINE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS MINE WHEN SHE... [screaming] SOLD IT? PLEASE... PLEASE, IT WAS ALL A MIX-UP, AND I'LL EXPLAIN THE WHOLE MIXED-UP STORY... OH, PLEASE, DON'T. NO, PLEASE, STOP. PLEASE, SPARE ME... THAT'S WHY, HE NOW WANTS $1,500 FROM ME TO GET THE CAR BACK, AND ALL I HAVE IS $500. WHO DOES? NO, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME! YOU WANT TO BORROW $1,000 FROM ME TO BUY BACK MY STATION WAGON WHICH SISTER JACQUELINE DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELL IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO THE BIGGEST CROOK IN ALL OF SAN JUAN? I GUESS THAT SUMS IT UP NICELY. THAT IS TOO MUCH! OH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, CARLOS. I'M REALLY SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED. OH, I CAN WORK IT OUT MYSELF. OH, NO, SISTER... SISTER BERTRILLE, PLEASE. PLEASE, STAY. LET ME, LET ME THINK FOR A MOMENT. [sighs] I THINK THIS IS ALL THE FAULT OF HERNANDO. YEAH. FOR SELLING YOU ONE OF THE BROKEN-DOWN USED CARS. YEAH, MAYBE SO. BUT, RIGHT NOW, I WISH I HADN'T SOLD THAT OLD JALOPY OF OURS, [muttering] EVEN THOUGH IT WAS JUST AN OLD RELIC. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WENT AND THAT WAS ALL WE NEEDED. WHAT DID YOU SAY? WHAT? WELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY? I DON'T KNOW. I JUST SAID I... I WISH WE HADN'T SOLD THE OLD RELIC, AND I MEANT IT. RELIC? YEAH. IT WAS A VERY OLD CAR, WASN'T IT? YES, BUT IT RAN, SOMETIMES. DOWNHILL. IF WE PUSHED IT. SISTER BERTRILLE? WHAT? I WAS JUST READING ABOUT AN OLD CAR LIKE YOURS. HERE. "MARMON 1914 PHAETON, "BOUGHT BY MILLIONAIRE WINTHROP VANDERHAVEN IV. LATEST ADDITION TO HIS GROWING NUMBER OF COLLECTOR'S ITEMS." I THINK YOU'VE GIVEN ME A GREAT IDEA. NOW, LISTEN. I WANT YOU TO DO EXACTLY AS I TELL YOU. AND, NO QUESTIONS, PLEASE. WHY? NO QUESTIONS, PLEASE. $100? FOR THIS OLD THING? WELL, YOU TOLD ME IT WAS ONLY WORTH $25. SISTER, I SINCERELY HOPE YOU DID NOT BELIEVE ME. SENOR HERNANDO, I'M LEARNING HOW YOU OPERATE. I'LL GIVE YOU $50, TAKE IT OR TAKE IT. I'LL TAKE IT. I THOUGHT SO. MAY I HELP YOU IN? YES. THANK YOU, SISTER. ENJOY IT. DRIVE CAREFULLY. AH, GOOD AFTERNOON, SENOR. I AM HERNANDO.
