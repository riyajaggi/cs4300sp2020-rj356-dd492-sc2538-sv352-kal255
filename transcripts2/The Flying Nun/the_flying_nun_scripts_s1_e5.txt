 The Flying Nun (1967–1970): Season 1, Episode 5 - The Fatal Hibiscus - full transcript 
 As much as she loves Sister Bertrille, the Reverend Mother believes that the high winds of San Juan create an environment not suitable for Sister Bertrille. This is highlighted by the fact that Sister Bertrille flew through a new stained-glass window with her errant flying. So the Reverend Mother makes the difficult decision to transfer her to another convent, possibly in Rome. As exciting as that may be, Sister Bertrille is devastated about leaving, and openly shows that. Her frequent bouts of tears are due to this, but she attributes it to her allergy to hibiscus flowers. Sister Bertrille asks that the Reverend Mother not tell the other sisters until just before her scheduled departure. But the sister does tell Carlos, who is also disheartened by the news, but would not dare question the Reverend Mother's decision. But Carlos works behind the scenes with the children of the convent to organize a protest to keep Sister Bertrille at San Tanco. Sister Ana overhears the news of Sister Bertrille's departure, thinking that Sister Bertrille is dying. So the sisters treat her with kid gloves. They also see the Reverend Mother is treating Sister Bertrille with her regular sternness, the sisters thinking her cold-hearted in light of Sister Bertrille's imminent 'passing'. Thus the sisters embark on a cold shoulder campaign toward the Reverend Mother, who thinks it was orchestrated by Sister Bertrille as defiance against the transfer. This strengthens Reverend Mother's resolve to transfer her. The misunderstanding becomes known and is resolved, and everyone becomes clear as to Sister Bertrille's real fate. The sisters also find out about Carlos's campaign; the sisters suggest to him that that may not be the best approach to take with the Reverend Mother, and Carlos calls off the campaign. However, the campaign takes on a life of its own extending to the people of the community; this shows the Reverend Mother what a truly profound effect Sister Bertrille has had in her short time at San Tanco. The sister can stay.

OF COURSE NOT. NOW THEY WILL LET THEIR HAIR FALL. LET THEIR HAIR DOWN. SISTER BERTRILLE. YES? THE FACT THAT YOU WILL BE LEAVING US SOON DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU TO MALINGER. I'M NOT MALINGERING, REVEREND MOTHER. SISTER JACQUELINE JUST ORDERED ME TO REST. WHATEVER FOR? BEATS ME. (Rev. Mother) WELL, UNTIL THE TIME COMES FOR YOU TO GO, SISTER, I EXPECT YOU TO DO YOUR DUTY. THAT DUTY IS WORK. DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING SO CRUEL? SO COLD, SO CALLOUS. OH, BOY, AM I BURNED OUT. BURNED UP, SISTER. FOR 10 YEARS I'VE IDOLIZED THE REVEREND MOTHER. I'VE PUT UP WITH HER AUTHORITARIANISM AND HER OLD-FASHIONED IDEAS. THIS TIME SHE GOES TOO FAR. WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS LYING DOWN? DOWN. YOU BET. REVEREND MOTHER, WE'LL FIX YOUR WIGWAM. (Jacqueline) THAT NIGHT, WE BEGAN FIXING THE WIGWAM. A LOVELY SHAWL. YOUR NIECE IS GOING TO ENJOY IT VERY MUCH. HMM. I DROPPED A STITCH. BOY, YOU... YOU SURE ARE BEATING ME, SISTER. CARE TO CHALLENGE HER, REVEREND MOTHER? UH, TH-THAT MIGHT BE VERY PLEASANT. MUCHAS GRACIAS. BUT I THINK I'M GONNA SLAP THE SACK EARLY TONIGHT. HIT THE SACK. HIT? SLAP? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? AS LONG AS IT HURTS. I'M A BIT TIRED MYSELF. ARE YOU READING ANOTHER MYSTERY, SISTER JACQUELINE? WELL, YES, WOULD YOU CARE TO READ IT? ALL... ALL RIGHT, THAT MIGHT BE VERY PLEASANT. I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY IT. THANK YOU. THE BUTLER'S BROTHER DID IT. I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD THIS PRAYER BEFORE, FATHER. BUT I, TOO, HAVE COME TO PRAY FOR SISTER BERTRILLE. DON'T TAKE HER FROM US. SHE'S SO YOUNG. (Jacqueline) HER... HER MISSION HERE HAS BARELY BEGUN. TAKE ME INSTEAD. PLEASE, FATHER. BUT IF THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE, AT LEAST DON'T LET REVEREND MOTHER BE SO CRUEL TO HER. SISTER BERTRILLE? GOOD MORNING. HYPOCRISY IS A GRIEVOUS SIN, SISTER. WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER TO DEFY ME OPENLY? DEFY YOU? YOU ASKED ME TO KEEP YOUR SECRET AND THEN YOU TURN THE OTHER SISTERS AGAINST ME. AND YOU ORGANIZE THIS, UH, THIS MUTINY. WELL, I DIDN'T ORGANIZE ANYTHING. PLEASE, SISTER. NO MORE DECEPTIONS. OUR PROVINCIAL MOTHER ARRIVES SUNDAY. WHEN SHE LEAVES, YOU WILL LEAVE WITH HER. BUT I... IS THAT UNDERSTOOD? YES. YES, OF COURSE. REVEREND MOTHER, THIS HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH. SISTER JACQUELINE, DESPITE YOUR EARNEST PRAYERS, SISTER BERTRILLE'S AFFAIRS ARE IN MY HANDS. WOULDN'T YOU SAY THEY'RE IN THE HANDS OF THE ALMIGHTY? NO. CONTRARY TO YOURSELF, I DO NOT PESTER THE ALMIGHTY WITH DETAILS. DETAILS? DYING? TRANSFERRED? I OWE HER AN APOLOGY. [birds chirping] COME, SISTER JACQUELINE. OH, YOU HAVE RESTORED IT. WONDERFUL, SENOR TRAZO. A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE THAT IT COULD BE DONE. DO YOU THINK THERE'S A MESSAGE THERE FOR US, SISTER JACQUELINE? PERHAPS. OH, SISTER ANA, HAVE YOU SEEN SISTER BERTRILLE? SHE'S GIVING THE CHILDREN A BADMINTON LESSON. IN THIS WIND? HOW TYPICAL OF THE CHILD TO SIMPLY PICK UP HER WORK AGAIN AFTER THE WAY I ABUSED HER. SHE HAS A TRULY SOARING SPIRIT. WHO WOULD THINK A LITTLE THING LIKE THIS COULD FLY SO HIGH? [groaning] (Jacqueline) REVEREND MOTHER POSTPONED MAKING ANY DECISION UNTIL OUR MOTHER PROVINCIAL'S VISIT. FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE ALL WALKED ON EGGSHELLS. OH, SISTER. FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT YOUR BALLOON WAS SISTER BERTRILLE. YOU DID? IT WORKS. PEDRO. WHAT WORKS? MIGUEL. COME ON NOW, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? PEDRO? NOW LOOK, BOYS, IF THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH SISTER BERTRILLE, SHE HAS A BIG PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. (Miguel) WE KNOW. SENOR RAMIREZ IS ORGANIZING A PROTEST MARCH. A WHAT? BUT I HAVE PLANNED A MAGNIFICENT STRATEGY. PHASE 1: THE CHILDREN. PHASE 2: I WILL CALL EVERYBODY IN TOWN. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE HER. THEY ALL BE AT MASS ON SUNDAY. PHASE 3: I WILL PERSONALLY TALK TO THE MOTHER PROVINCIAL. PHASE 4... SISTER BERTRILLE GETS SHIPPED OUT ON THE FIRST BOAT. ARE YOU SURE? THE REVEREND MOTHER IS STILL ON THE FENCE. IF YOU STAGE THIS PROTEST MARCH, IT'LL TURN INTO A BON VOYAGE PARTY. BUT I JUST CAN'T SIT HERE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING. THEY ALSO SERVE... I KNOW. I KNOW. MISS FERNANDEZ, PLEASE GET... DON'T GET ME ANYBODY. I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO VISITING SAN TANCO. IT'S SO RESTFUL HERE. [bell tolling] SISTER BERTRILLE? ISN'T THAT THE NOVICE YOU WROTE TO ME ABOUT? UH, YES, UH, SHE IS THE ONE. SHALL WE GO ON, MOTHER PROVINCIAL? MOTHER PLASEATO, YOU SAID THE TOWNSPEOPLE NEVER CAME TO MASS. IT'S A RATHER SUDDEN DEVELOPMENT. GOOD MORNING, REVEREND MOTHER. GOOD MORNING. WELL, SINCE SISTER BERTRILLE'S BEEN HERE, WELL, I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT. I SEE. SISTER BERTRILLE, WELL, WE LOVE HER. SISTER BERTRILLE, WELL, SHE SORT OF, UH, SHOWED ME THE ODDS, YOU KNOW. UH, OF COURSE. THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE. UH, YES. AND I THINK I KNOW THE ONE WHO HAS ARRANGED THE IMPRESSION. OH, REVEREND MOTHER, ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN... PLEASE, DO NOT BOTHER, SENOR. IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT YOU ARE THE ONE WHO INSTIGATED ALL OF THIS. OH, I WAS GOING TO, BUT I DIDN'T. IT'S TRUE, REVEREND MOTHER, I WAS THERE. IT SEEMS TO HAVE STARTED A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT IN SPITE OF US. I GUESS THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF FEELING THAT YOU CAN START OR STOP, REVEREND MOTHER. WHERE IS SISTER BERTRILLE? SHE'S IN HER ROOM. MOTHER PROVINCIAL, WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR JUST A MOMENT? THANK YOU. [birds chirping] [knocking on door] YES. SISTER BERTRILLE? YES, REVEREND MOTHER. WHY ARE YOU NOT AT MASS? I WENT TO EARLY MASS IN TOWN. I... I WANTED TO GET STARTED PACKING. COME WITH ME. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF SOUNDS IN THIS WONDERFUL WORLD. SURELY, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IS THE SOUND OF LOVE. SOMETIMES WE TRY NOT TO HEAR IT. I DO NOT KNOW WHY. PERHAPS IT'S FEAR OR FOOLISHNESS. A FEW MOMENTS AGO, I HEARD THE SOUND MORE CLEARLY THAN I HAVE EVER HEARD IT BEFORE. AND I THINK THAT YOU HAD BETTER UNPACK. WELCOME TO SAN TANCO. OH, REVEREND MOTHER! OH, FORGIVE ME. I'M JUST SO HAPPY. I'M SO HAPPY THAT I COULD... YOU'RE SO HAPPY THAT YOU COULD... YOU GO AHEAD.
