 The Flying Nun (1967–1970): Season 1, Episode 7 - Polly Wants a Cracked Head - full transcript 
 Exasperated with the sharp tongue of her talking parrot Junior his vocabulary learned in her saloon, Rose Dolan threatens to fricassee him unless Sisters Bertrille and Jacqueline take him off her hands. Seeing that the convent does not allow pets, the sisters need to find Junior a good home. Unable to do so, they clandestinely take Junior back to the convent. However, Junior's big mouth gives him away. They try and reform his language to convince the Reverend Mother to let him stay, but they fail in their task. As a last resort, Sister Bertrille tries Carlos, who does end up taking Junior. But when Junior's language ruins a date, Carlos wants to get rid of him. Junior has the same idea and flies out the window. It's then that Rose changes her mind - she misses Junior and wants him back. She's heartbroken when she learns of Junior's fate. To help Rose, Sister Bertrille goes out looking for Junior. Miraculously. she finds him, just before a couple of ornithologists are about to nab Junior themselves. Rose and Junior live happily ever after.
