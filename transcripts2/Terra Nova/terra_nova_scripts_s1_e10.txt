 TAYLOR: I'm having an OTG. Something I gotta take care of. When will you be back? 24 hours at most. Good. I've been thinking about the anniversary as well. It sure doesn't seem like three years, does it? Yeah, doesn't. You know, Skye, your parents would be real proud of the young woman you've become. You say that every year.

 Well, it's true every year. We lost a lot of good people that winter, your folks included. I think syncillic fever has killed more people than anything else this place has thrown at us. Do you think they'll ever find a cure? I sure hope so. So, when I get back, if you like, you and I can take a walk out to Memorial Field together. - I'd love that. - Good. - Thank you. - It's all right. DUNHAM: Commander. What is it, Dunham?

 What's your reason for leaving the colony today? Beg pardon? All citizens need a valid, colony business-related reason for departing. JIM: He's right, Commander. Your new lockdown protocols. No exceptions. You said it yourself. That I did. Good job, soldier. - Thank you, sir. - You're dismissed. - But I haven't... - Just go. Yes, sir. Open the gates for the commander. I never wanted to see those towers pointing any direction but out. This is temporary. We'll find the spy. Stay on it, will you, Shannon? You're the only one around here I trust 100% right now. Especially in my absence. Washington is out there with the survey team at Outpost Number Nine for at least the next three days. You're in charge until I get back. Good luck, Commander. (engine whooshing) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (whirring) (rifle whines) Don't! Don't even think about it, Taylor. Mira. What brings you out this way? Same as you. Came to see if your boy's gotten any closer to an answer. Looks like he has. Well, isn't it a lousy day to be you? Hands behind your back. Get on the ground. Sync and corrected by dr.jackson for www.addic7ed.com - TERRA NOVA - Ep. 09 - Now You See Me (bleating) He's hungry today. And I have a math test first period, so let's get going. I think I'll call him... Boxer. What do you think? I think that yesterday you decided to call him Hank, the day before that it was Orville, and that's pretty much how it's been going now, for almost a month. Well, I want to make sure I get it right. MALCOLM: Jim, no! Impossible. JIM: Malcolm, you don't have a choice. Every time you data swap with one of your survey RB's, you gotta do it on a secure channel in the compound. Look. If I can't communicate in real time from my laboratory, I might as well halt the research. Security trumps research for now. We've cut the Sixer spy off. They're gonna need to find a new way to talk, and there's a chance they'll try to piggyback on your frequency. This is nonsense. Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Actually, I'm not. This is the new protocol. Okay? We clear? Yep. You asked to see me, sir? You don't have to call me "sir." Today I do. Relieve Rogers and Blanchard at the northeast gate. You seem more nervous than usual. Is that because today I'm not just Maddy's father, I'm also your C.O.? Permission to neither confirm nor deny, sir? Permission granted. I know it might seem a little strange, Taylor having a non-military person in charge. Thanks. How are the other soldiers taking it? Like an order, sir. Good. The reason I called you up: you're the duty officer on tour? If any of the work detail wants to leave the colony the foreman must see me first. Understood? Sir, got something! JIM: What is it? Flashes of light from the tree line. Definitely a telegraphic code. That's got to be a Sixer. We need eyes on the return signal. The spy is talking back from inside the colony. But where? Come on. Hold on. You got something? Maybe. Flashes in the new construction. Row J. JIM: That's not just a reflection. It's some kind of code. That's our guy. Nice catch, Reynolds. You're with me. (horn honking) Come on, come on. Come on, move! Want to call for some backup? Nah, you and I are gonna take this. I want to keep this circle tight. I don't know who we can trust. Those lights still active? Affirmative, sir. All right. 30 seconds out. They gotta keep talking till then. Reynolds. Come over here. Look at this. There, in the paint sealant. Looks like blood. Base camp, this is Mira. Come in. Carter, come in. You're never going to get a signal down here, don't you know that? - You gotta be up on the ridge. - MIRA: Shut up and keep moving. This mean I'm finally going to get a look at Mira's lair? Yeah, well, it's not much, but it's home. For now, anyways. Getting back to 2149... that's the plan, isn't it? Going back rich... that's the plan. Once Lucas finishes his work. Putting a lot of faith in some guy who spends his days scrawling equations on the rocks. Oh, he puts them there for you to see so you know he's getting closer to making the portal go both ways. And there's nothing you can do to stop him. Don't bet on that. (scoffs) Pretty smug for a guy who's tied up and being taken to the enemy camp. So what's the play, bringing me in this way? If you think my people are gonna cut some kind of a deal for my release, - you're out of your mind. - Yeah, well, either way, with you gone, Terra Nova is that much more vulnerable. (beeping) (high-pitched whirring and whooshing) (explosive shot) (grunts) Get up! I'm the one with the gun. That wasn't a very smart move. Now let's go. (sighs) Come on. JOSH: Hey. Hey, Skye. Hey. Um, I'm sorry. I'm running late. Listen, this'll only take a second. I want to apologize for everything. For stealing the medication, for dragging you into this whole thing with Mira and the Sixers. I just didn't think it would turn into such a ginormous mess. I told you it would. I mean, I should have listened. Look, Josh... (sighs) The Sixers don't mess around. Terra Nova wouldn't be on lockdown if they were just our friendly neighbors. - Yeah, I know. - Look, Josh, I'm really late. So this means you accept my apology? Warily. (laughing): I'll take warily. I'll see you later. Yeah, all the information we need is on here. It just needs transferring, basically. Is that all right? - Thanks so much. - Thank you. Um, Elisabeth? Morning, Malcolm. Can I ask...? Hi. Um, can I talk to you - about something? - Sure. The baby Ankylosaurus. Yeah, I think he's healthy enough now to be released into the wild. I don't know. His musculature could be more developed. Maybe in a few weeks. If he stays in the laboratory much longer, he's gonna lose the ability to coexist with his own kind altogether. You know that. Not necessarily. There are many differing opinions on adaptation studies and development... Elisabeth, you've let him stay here too long. I think we both know why. Zoe's going to be heartbroken, but I will talk to her. You win. The Ankylosaurus goes home to the wild soon. - Uh... today. - Tomorrow. - You're impossible. - Thank you, Malcolm. - Hey, Skye. - Hey. You're not on shift until tonight, right? Uh, no. I just, uh, forgot my I.D. in my locker. Okay, see you soon. (squishing) REYNOLDS: I combed the entire area. No trace anywhere. They got away. Shh-shh. Don't move. Our mole must have got cut trying to get away. I'm just gonna try to grab the sample before it dissolves completely. Damn it. (sighs) JIM: Elisabeth. Oh, hey, what are you doing here? (creature gurgles) Um, I just broke the news that the baby Ankylosaurus has to go home. Well, remember, sweetie, we talked about this. He has to go home sometime. What's up? Uh, I could use your help. - What's this? - Evidence. Okay. Uh, hey... honey, why don't you go and spend some time with Hank, yeah? His name's Boxer. Okay, what kind of evidence? Blood. We got close to the Sixer spy. They slipped away, but they may have left some DNA behind in this. Well, how much blood was there? One drop. (chuckles) You're not joking, are you? Even if there's the slightest trace of blood, isolating it is gonna be, well, nearly impossible. Jim, I'm a doctor, not a chemist. You're gonna have to talk to Malcolm. Sorry. I've always wondered how'd you manage to get so many people on the Sixth Pilgrimage without Hope Plaza catching on? My employers have deep pockets. They gamed the lottery. I thought so. What's the plan? Take me down, help Lucas reverse the portal, and then strip-mine this place for everything it's worth? The job was supposed to take six months, tops. You hadn't caught onto us, I would have been back in 2149 with my daughter a long time ago. That is so sweet. You and your little girl living the good life in one of the domes. Who are you to judge me? We were living on the street. Sienna got patch lung 'cause I couldn't afford a doctor. Was I gonna get recruited to come here? An ex-con and her sick daughter? I had an opportunity to make a better life for her and I took it. And I'm not gonna apologize for it. Not to you or anyone. Now move. (animal screeches) (screeching continues) (gasps) (gasps) (gun cocks, whirrs) (groans) (gasps) Your turn to wear the cuffs. (gun whirrs) So... we're gonna take a walk back to your rover, and then I'm taking you to my brig. Come on. Slow. (distant squawking) (animal growls) (animal screeches) I told Skye to meet me here, but she didn't confirm she could make it out. We got cut off mid-signal. Yeah, Terra Nova's on lockdown. She's smart. She'll find a way. When she shows up, bring her back to base camp. I'll hang tight. Yeah. (clanging) Hey. Hey, Skye. Where you digging? OTG. We're preparing a new line for the Eleventh at the water supply junction. Need any more volunteers? Uh, don't you have your medical internship with my mom? I'm on evening shift. Well, go get your work gear. We leave in about five minutes, I guess. All right. When did you last see him? Lucas? A couple of weeks. He comes and goes when he wants. How did he look? (scoffs) You're asking me if he's getting enough sleep and eating his vegetables? You know this whole father-son drama? I don't pity you. Whatever's about to come down on your head, you brought it on yourself. What the hell does that mean? I asked Lucas why he hates you so much, and he said to ask you about Somalia. So? What happened in Somalia? (grunts) Now the beast comes out to play. He's my son. I want him back. You think you can get him back? He's gone, Taylor. You don't even know what you're dealing with. Lucas is crazy. You think I control him? He controls me. (animal growls in distance) Quiet. We're being watched. (growling in distance) Keep moving. Absolutely not. Tell me why. Because it's the chemical equivalent of a needle in a haystack. The dominant ingredient in paint sealant is toluene. And one of its many talents? Destroying red blood cells. So, you're not gonna help me. - Nope. - Fine. I'm busy with something else. What are you doing? I'm hunting a spy. Now, I'm a little rusty since high school chem, but, uh... Whoops. Are you insured for that? You are insane. I'm motivated. Big difference. - How does this work? - No, no. No! You're going to blow up the lab. Are you trying to kill us all? (device beeps) Malcolm. Unbelievable. (glass crunches underfoot) Huh. Well? Yeah, there's a chance. A slight one. But a chance. I'll let you get to it. Thanks for working as fast as you can. Zoe? Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy. I was just looking for Maddy so... we can go for a walk. JIM: Hmm. You're supposed to be in school. Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go back to school now. (chuckles) Zoe? Let me have a look. (guttural purring) Oh, Zoe... DUNHAM: I gotta say, I just don't get it. What? Why someone would betray the colony. I know. Well, I used to be pretty down about this place, but now it's kinda grown on me. Seeing as how I tagged along, I should probably go check in with the foreman. I'll save you a spot. I was starting to think you weren't gonna make it. I'm here. Let's go. Man: Lift them up. (cable whizzing) This week's intel. Now let me see her. She looks worse today. We haven't given her the meds for a couple days. What? Why? You were late with the intel drop. You son of a bitch. You want out of the deal? Go ahead. Take her back to Terra Nova and watch her die. Which she will, without this. Remember, we're the only ones with a cure. Next time don't be late. (sighs) Hi. It's me. Skye, you're here. How you doing, Mom? (coughs) Mom, they're going to give you more medicine. But I need to get back before I'm missed. Elisabeth. - Hey. - Hey. What is that? Clean sample. But that's all we could extract. Malcolm did this? Yeah, but it took some persuading. Okay. - And we're off. - Okay. You know, given the level of dissolution, this DNA extraction isn't going to be ready until tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow morning? - Yeah. Well, is there anything we can do to speed up the process? No, I'm sorry. It needs time. But it will give you the identity of the traitor. Okay. Look, I've got to go debrief this morning's security patrols. If anything comes up, find a soldier, raise me. Copy that, sir. Dr. Shannon, I'm sorry I'm late. I was helping out with Josh's detail. Oh, of course. No problem. Um, so, uh, do you want me to finish the supplies inventory from last night? Um, actually Nurse Ogawa is prepping and sterilizing the CO-2 inhalers for the arrival of the Eleventh. Maybe you can help with that. - Yeah, of course. - Thanks, Skye. Enough? (distant chittering) So, uh, how old is she? Turned seven in July. Seven... that's a good age. Guess I'll have to just take your word for it. You got somebody looking after her? That's part of the deal. Even if I can't be with her, at least I know she's okay. That's no small thing, knowing you've done right by your child. (rustling) (squawking) He looks good, by the way. Lucas. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. (squawking) That's good to hear. (animals chittering) I'm getting that feeling again. Yeah. Something's out there. It's stalking us. (animal chittering) (rustling) It's over there. (slashers howl) Run. Go. (slashers howling) Move! Keep moving! Come on, keep moving! Faster! (grunts) (howling) On your feet. Let's go. (both grunting) Come on. (slashers screech) (both grunting) (slashers howling) It's all I could come up with. I can't find the damn guns. Can't see a damn thing down there. Let it go, Taylor. You dove five times. The pool's too deep. This is not slasher territory. What are they doing here? You see those yellow oval spots on the male's neck? Adolescent markings. Gone by the time a slasher turns four. Yeah, what we got here is a male and a female marking out their region for the first time. (exhales) They're moving in. That's why they're so aggressive. In their minds, we're competing for this turf. That attack was as much about claiming territory as it was about killing us. They're going to be back. Oh, yeah, I figure they're working their way down around the falls right now. (exhales) Guns are gone. This is all we got. We can fight each other... or we can fight them. Sun's going down. We'll never make it back to your transport before nightfall. That's when they'll attack again. Yeah. This is good ground. It's defensible, good sight lines. We stay here and we fight. (equipment trilling and beeping) (equipment trilling) Not bad. It'll never burn. That's too thick. It's just right. Listen to me. I know how to fight these bastards. I spent 118 days out here on my own. Good for you... I'm coming up on a thousand. You know, after we left Terra Nova, we lost a lot of good people before we learned how to survive... but we learned. (distant squawking) (growling and squawking) You ready? Ready. (indistinct chatter) REYNOLDS: I know you're busy, sir, but if I could just have a minute... JIM: Sure, make it quick, Reynolds. Uh, the, the events in the last couple of days just got me to thinking that, uh, you know, w-what's important in life an- an-and what's not important and that life, life is short, so short, and... I would like to declare my intentions for your daughter. Excuse me? Uh... I-I mean, w-w-what I'm saying is that I... someday I would, uh... like to make her my wife. Maddy's 16. Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, I-I know, and, and, look, I-I will wait. No, it's always been my intention to wait. Copy that. Reynolds, did you forget that we're hunting a spy? Copy that. Any news on the blood sample? I'm going to check that now. Yeah, I-I'm going to go away. I'll, uh... bye. What happened? One of the night nurses called me. It's the DNA sample. It's destroyed. The spy. It's someone who had access - to this building. - Yeah, well, they obviously caught on that you were getting close and decided to cover their tracks. I need you to put together a list of all medical center employees, the patients, and, uh, their families who came to visit them. Okay, I'll do it. It won't be a short list. Maybe not, but it's a list and the mole is on it, and that's a start. Huh, nice tattoo. You were a Secessionist. I worked security for them. So you were at the Dome when the army stormed the place? That's why you went to prison. Couldn't get work after that. Guess that's what happens when you choose the wrong side. And here you are, on the wrong side once again. We'll see. I'm gonna grab another stave, make a backup. (rustling and growling) Take the shot. (growling) (growling) (yelling) (growling) (growling) (screeching and growling) (squealing) (panting) Grubs. Protein. Could have been different. What's that? You and I. I figure there's a parallel universe out there somewhere where... we are allies. I've had that thought. You're smart. Good fighter. We could have made a hell of a team. (trilling) 84 suspects. Better than the whole colony. We just got to figure out a way to narrow down this list. (sighs) ELISABETH: I can narrow it down for you now. I combed through the shards of data that were left. Now, the DNA extraction didn't complete, but it went far enough to tell us that you are looking for a female. Huh. A woman. 84 names just became... 47. Taylor? Nice hunting with you. I was about to say the same thing. Look, your son is close to figuring out how to reverse the portal. - This really is almost over. - Maybe so. Question is... how does it end? We'll find out soon enough. Okay Z, it's time to take Boxer home. Bye, Boxer. I'll miss you. Now, be a good boy, eat lots of leaves, and sleep all the time, and have good dreams and play with your friends. (Boxer coos) Okay? All right, Z, it's time. (cooing) (bellowing) Bye. (cooing) (cooing) Uh, sir? Uh, it was a pleasure riding with you today. That's what the cops say, right? Close enough. (sighs) Reynolds? Come here. Got to tell you something. Look, I know I make you nervous, and I can be a little tough sometimes, but Maddy's my oldest girl. I get protective. You know? And if you think I'm bad, you should have met Elisabeth's father back in the day. I mean, compared to him, I'm a... I'm a puppy dog. (both laugh) Anyway, uh... I think you're a good kid. And that's it. - Thank you, sir. - Oh. No, I'm not your C.O. anymore, so, no need to call me sir. - Thanks, Jim. - No, no. It's still Mr. Shannon to you. Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry. JIM: Whoa. You look like you were wrestling with a Nyko. It was not a boring trip. So, Lucas make any progress reversing the portal? I'm afraid he has. How about you? You making progress? Oh, we got it down to 47 suspects. And we know it's a woman. (sighs) 47. You keep working on it. Get this finished for me. I will. How'd it feel? Wearing the commander's cap while I was gone? Wouldn't want to do it every day. (laughs) - Skye. - Mr. Shannon. - Glad you're back. - Good to be back. It's good to see you. Everything okay? You bet. So, we still gonna take a walk together out to Memorial Field? Yeah, I hope so. Good. All right, let me get myself cleaned up, and, uh, I'll meet you at the main gate in, uh, 15 or 20. You know, I meant what I said to you. They'd be real proud to see the fine young woman you've become. Skye, you got something on your mind? - No. - All right.
