 This way a little more. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey, no, no, no, no, come on. Come on, this way. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, come on. Whoa! Come on, no fair. Wow. Hey, look at all the flowers. What kind of work were they doing out there? Standard field research. It's nothing dangerous. Yeah? Then why hasn't anyone heard from them in the last 72 hours? Well, that's what we're going there to find out. Stop worrying. Commander Taylor says we'll probably be back before dinner.

 Well, we better be 'cause that Reynolds kid is coming a-courting tonight. Don't make fun. I think it's really sweet the way he's going about things the old-fashioned way. Well, I think it's weird. I'm telling you, it's a tech situation, not a science situation. The signal's been spotty out in that area for weeks. I'm sure it's just a downed comm relay, but if I need you, I will let you know. They're my people out there. I should be going with you. I'll take my own rover. Don't worry, Malcolm, I'll be your eyes out there. - You'll get a full report. - Thank you, Elisabeth. Lieutenant Washington is in command while I'm off colony. You need anything, you talk to her.

 - All right, let's go. Move out. All right, be safe. Whoa, my wedding ring? I took it off before surgery this morning. Could you stop by the hospital and pick it up for me? - It should be in my scrub locker, I think. - Sure. Unless, of course, I left it inside a patient. Doc? - See you. So they give you your own rover, huh? Chief Science Officer. One of the perks of the job. Well, I'm the only cop in town, they didn't give me one. That must be awkward with your siren. Whoa, whoa! Doc. That gate should not be open. Commander. Looks like they've had ovosaurs out here chewing on the power cables. Let's make sure none of them wandered in. Stay alert. Don't you wander either, Doc. Stick close. What kind of work did you say they were doing at this outpost? Wetlands research. Commander Taylor! Come on! Hey, Doc, take a look at this. Brady, let's get this door open. The snow was up to my knees, but I must have run for an hour straight. I guess that's how I wound up here. Are you with the Red Cross? Something like that, yes. This is gonna help you relax. Here we go. Snow up to her knees? I guess I must've missed the blizzard. Not if you were in Detroit in 2137. It was the coldest October ever recorded, while the city burned. - The Detroit Food Riots. - Yeah. From what I can tell, that's where she thinks she is. - She has no idea she's in Terra Nova. - Doc, what's going on here? I don't know. Her vitals are normal. There doesn't appear to be anything physically wrong. It's some sort of dissociative disorder. What about the other two? My best guess, same thing, only more advanced. Look, Doc. Three people don't just lose their minds at the same time. There's got to be a reason. It's Wednesday, I think. I can't be sure. It's happening to me just like with the others. First, short-term memory becomes jumbled, confused. Then one finds oneself somewhere in one's past. I don't recognize him. He's not in the infirmary. This outpost has a staff of four. That's Dr. Jonathan Guagenti. He's head researcher here. Brady? I ought to remember the three people in the infirmary. This fella is still missing. Search the perimeter, 200-yard radius. - Be back by sundown. - Yes, sir. I know I have to tell someone about the pathogens before they spread. I just can't remember who. Okay, a pathogen. So that's what's behind this. So what are the chances we've been exposed? Fairly likely, I'm afraid. And it looks like he's made some progress towards a diagnosis, but then his handwriting just deteriorates and then it becomes a nursery rhyme. You think you can finish what he started? I can try. Try hard, Doc. Till we know what this is, we're not going home. - Mr. Shannon. - Yeah? - Dr. Shannon's wedding ring. - Great, thanks. You didn't have to cut anyone open, did you? Never mind, thank you. What are you two doing here? Shouldn't you be at school? Zoe's sick, and this time she's not pretending. It's just a cold, but they asked me to take her out of class. I need Mommy. I'm sorry, sweetie, Mommy's not here. - Where is she? - She had to go save some other people. I'll tell you what, why don't we go see if there's anything in this hospital for a cold, and then I take you home? Just be careful. Don't catch her cold. I never catch colds. Only crooks. Here's another one. To the stars. God, they're beautiful. Hey, any word from Outpost 3? I heard they went dark. My mom's out there now, nothing yet. You're good. Thanks. No, don't stop. Any luck finding Guagenti? Found his boots. He's out there barefoot? No, his feet were still in 'em. Oh. You got enough to go on to figure out what we're dealing with here? - Yeah, I think so. - All right. This outpost is under general quarantine, nobody in or out. I'm not going to risk exposing anyone or the colony to this. - So do you know what it is? Some kind of memory loss. Could be anything, contaminated rations or an insect bite. I'm running blood samples now. I should know more soon. You're not just making all this up to get out of tonight, are you? Of course not. What time's Maddy's gentleman caller coming, anyway? I don't know, but she's changed outfits, like, three times already. I used to do that for you, you know. Be nice to him. I'll try. I love you. Love you, too. Kiss the kids for me. What was that? - I picked up a cold. - Fluids and straight to bed. I don't want to catch your cold when I get back. It's not my cold, I borrowed it from Zoe. Okay, feel better, I'll call you in the morning. Bye. Bye. Zoe? Who's Zoe? Some more key lime pie? Not that there's actually any lime in it, because limes won't evolve until millions of years later. Anyway... So, do you find that you enjoy cooking? Yeah. It's kind of like chemistry, except, at the end, you get a treat. - I should get going. - Right, yeah. Sorry. Oops. Well, thank you for welcoming me into your home. Bye, Mr. Shannon. Okay, tell me the truth. Was that the worst first date in the history of the universe? Not even close. Yeah. You're saying that to make me feel better. I'm saying it 'cause I lived it. It was my first date with your mom. She was so astronomically out of my league. A fact that her friends brought up constantly. By the time I picked her up, I'd psyched myself out so much, I was a total wreck. But when it was all over, guess what? I asked her out again 'cause I knew that no matter how much of a fool I made out of myself, in the end, it'd be worth it. - What's the word from Outpost 3? - Still waiting. What do you mean? Shouldn't they have checked in? Yes, but we've been having communication problems out that way for the past week or so. Well, maybe you should send another team to see if they're okay. Commander Taylor left me with very specific orders. Until he directs otherwise, Outpost 3 is under general quarantine. Quarantine? No, no. I spoke to my wife last night. She never used the word quarantine. If Commander Taylor hasn't checked in by nightfall, I will consider sending another team at that time. I'm not waiting around for that. I'm going out there. That is out of the question. You will remain here, and as soon as I know anything more, you will be informed. Understood. I need your rover. And I need my favorite reading glasses that I left back in Boston. - Elisabeth's in trouble. - What's going on? I don't know, but Outpost 3 is under quarantine. Where do you think you're going? To launch a complaint with Lieutenant Washington. All science outposts are my jurisdiction. It's entirely unacceptable I haven't been briefed about it. And I'm personally offended for you, but before you go, I need the ignition code to your rover and about a 10-minute head start. No. I'm going with you. No, you're not. This is a medical emergency. What are you going to do without me? - Shoot them back to health? - Fine, but I'm drive... - Oh, God. You have a cold. - I have kids. Here. Chew on this. Huh? I won't have you sneezing on me the whole way. Chew it. You'll be good for 12 hours. - It tastes awful! - Yeah, I know. Scoot over. I've been meaning to talk to you about something. Remember that day, out by the falls, when you showed me those calculations or whatever they were? Mmm-hmm. Don't you think that we should... Tell someone? Who? I don't know. I forget what I was talking about. Skye. You know I like you. I'd be insane not to. Just the way I left things with Kara. The way we said goodbye. I can't. I'm sorry. It's okay. I get it. You hate me now. I do not hate you, Josh. You promised Kara you'd try to get her here. What if I told you I might know a guy who could help you with that? What the hell is that? Ovosaurs. Damn it. I keep telling Taylor we should sink these cables deeper. It's the nickel. It's like catnip to them. Outpost 3, this is Terra Nova. Come in, Commander Taylor. Outpost 3, this is Terra Nova. Do you copy? Outpost 3, this is Terra Nova. Come in. Commander Taylor, are you there? Commander Taylor isn't here right now. Can I take a message? - What the hell are you doing there? - Well, I'm looking for my wife. Where's the commander? I don't know yet, but I'll let you know as soon as I find out. Good talk. Over. Hi. Elisabeth? Don't move! Elisabeth, it's us. Malcolm? Malcolm. Okay, don't worry. What the hell's going on? Why doesn't she recognize me? Okay. She seems to have lost all memory of the last 20 or so years. As far as Elisabeth's concerned, she's in university, she and I have just started dating. Oh, terrific. So, you're in the honeymoon period. - Malcolm, how did this happen? - Some kind of pathogen. I looked at the notes she made before she became symptomatic. The first stage of the disease is intermittent memory loss. The infected become disoriented. They can hold on, but with some effort. And they eventually do become unmoored, which leads to stage two, which is catastrophic memory loss. That could explain why we can't find Taylor or Brady. According to Elisabeth's notes, the final stage of the disease is full-on catatonia. Malcolm, can you cure this thing? With her help, I believe so. I mean, she's still Elisabeth. Her cognitive mind is still functioning, and even as a student, she was amazing. We just need to bring her up to the present as fast as possible. Okay. - Well, guess I better introduce myself. - Actually, you know what? It'd probably be better if I do the talking. I mean, we just need to give her enough information to get her back to work. You throw a husband and kids at her right now, it'll just confuse her. So, you're going to tell her it's 20 years later than she thinks it is, and she's gone back in time 85 million years, but you think a husband's gonna confuse her? Look, she doesn't remember who you are. You want to break out the family album, be my guest. - I'm just trying to be efficient. - Fine. We'll do it your way. Okay. Elisabeth, this is Jim Shannon. He's with Security. Pleased to meet you. - Hey, Tom. - Skye. - You got a minute? - Yeah. I told Josh you're a man who can get things here. Well, I've done so in the past. Or the future, I should say. - People, too? - People? People is difficult. And expensive. How expensive? More than a kid your age could afford. Well, I've got time to earn, and this couldn't happen until the pilgrimage after next, right? Because you'd have to get a message through to 2149, and that could only happen when the portals open. Or so Taylor says. You're the cop's son, right? 'Cause... Trust is important around here. So, theoretically, if a person had secrets, would they be safe with you? Why, are we theoretically having a job interview right now? Eighty-five million BC? You people couldn't time travel to after the ice age? It was too complicated. The important thing is that you came to this outpost and identified a pathogen that causes some kind of amnesia. And it's affecting you, too. - You don't believe me? Well, of course I don't because what you're talking about is completely ridiculous. The incubation period is approximately four to six hours. If you don't believe him, maybe you'll believe yourself. The incubation period is approximately four to six hours. Early symptoms include disorientation, loss of short-term memory. It appears to involve cognitive regression to a point in the patient's history, in their past. - I'm so old. - No, you're not. You're beautiful. And the disease appears to reach its third and final stage within 36 to 48 hours. It remains to be seen whether the catatonia is reversible. Okay. - How long have I been here? - A little over a day. Then we need to figure this out before I get any worse and before you two start showing any symptoms. What's happening? - Ovosaurs, chewing on the power cables. Could be. All right, I'll go chase 'em off. You all right? Brady? Move a muscle, I'll blow your head off. James Shannon. Terra Nova Security. What's Terra Nova? Hmm? This place? Not exactly. It's a code name, isn't it? Is that what you're calling this operation, Terra Nova? Taylor, listen to me, I don't know when or where you think you are... Save it. I know exactly where I am. - Somalia, 2138. - What are you talking about? The only question is who's running this mind game on me? I know the Somalis ain't got the tech to get inside my head like this. That means you are either Axis psi-ops, or you're Russo-Chinese. I'll figure it out. - And then I'll know who took her. - What do you mean, her? You mean Wash? You're a liar. I was there when they medevac'd her out. There's no way she's in on this. Where's Ayani? - Where did they take her? - Who? My wife. My son. Taylor... I saw those people strapped in back, the ones you're experimenting on. You're lucky I didn't find my family there, and you better pray that I do find them. If I don't, I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna slit every throat in sight. Count on it. Malcolm. Look at the DNA sequencing on this blood sample. This isn't a pathogen we're dealing with. Someone in this lab was experimenting with gene therapy. That's impossible. Any research involving genetic manipulation has to be cleared through me. Well, then, so, whoever it is, is obviously trying to keep it a secret. - You're so beautiful. - What? Let's skip class today. Hmm? Malcolm, hey, look at me. I am looking at you. I can't help but look at you. This doesn't feel right, Malcolm, please. Yeah, Malcolm. Please. Jack! What are you doing? He's been infected! No, I'm fine. I'm fine now. I just drifted, but I'm okay. - Where are you? - Terra Nova. Research outpost. If you can remember that, remember this. That's my wife, so keep your hands to yourself. What happened to you? I found Taylor. He's infected. He thinks he's in some kind of psi-ops sim back in Somalia. I know he served there. They did some horrible psychological experiments during that war. And if that's the last thing he remembers, then everything he's seeing now doesn't make much sense to him, just like it didn't to Elisabeth when we first found her. He's trying to make his way back to Terra Nova. He'll find it. He's motivated. He thinks his wife's in danger. If he makes it back to the colony, he'll infect everyone. Which is why we need to warn them, except we can't. Com system went out when we lost power. You have to follow him. No, no, no. We have to assume Jack's been infected, too. Jim. It's Jim. And no, I feel fine. So did he five minutes ago. Have you experienced any disorientation at all since you've been here? - No. - That's curious. The two of you were exposed at the same time, so why aren't you showing any symptoms? I don't know. But Taylor did a job on that soldier Brady back there, so I'm gonna get him to the infirmary, so you can check he's okay. - Okay. We'll get back to work. - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Actually, why don't you come give me a hand? This guy's not small. Hey. Mark! I'm so sorry. - I totally forgot. - No. I wanted... I thought that we knew that it was canceled tonight because my parents are missing and... I just came to check if you were okay. Are you okay? You know what the worst part is? Having absolutely no idea what's going on. All my dad said was he was going to help my mom, and then nothing from either of them. Yeah, that's rough. It could be anything, you know? Sixers could have ambushed them. It's not the Sixers. Then you know what's going on. Look, Maddy, I'm really not supposed to be talking about this. Mark, it's my parents. No way. Of all the times you could have flashed back to, did it have to be when you were dating my wife? I saw Elisabeth in a laboratory and my mind must have filled in the rest. - What do you want me to say? - That it won't happen again. It won't happen again. - What? - Oh, my God. Who is this? - Who are you? - God, what now? Did we kill this man? No, he's not even dead. See? So come on, give me a hand. Look, I don't want any trouble. I'm here on a grant. Come on, just pick up his legs. Malcolm? Move! Those are the ugliest dogs I've ever seen. Maybe they'll just eat that soldier and go away. Stay here. What are you doing? The nickel in the cables! They can smell it! Clear the door. Get out of the way! Wherever you are, this is not happening. Any second now, you're gonna wake up. Dear God, somebody help me. What the hell were those things? Calm down. What did you just do? Uh... No choice. So, where are we on this cure? Nowhere. I mean... I really felt like we were making some progress, but I can't do this without Malcolm. You don't need Malcolm. You were doing just fine before he got here. No, I was cowering in the corner with a rifle. You were confused and alone, but you're not anymore. - Do we know each other? - Yeah. We do. We come from the same place, the future. But we're more than just acquaintances, aren't we? We're friends. Yeah, we are. All right. So we know somebody in this lab was conducting illicit gene therapy experiments. Now, if I knew who that was, I might be able to figure out what it is they were trying to do, and then that might help me work out how to undo it. Yeah. Suspect and motive. Now you're talking my language. Okay, so we need to start going through the staff's personal files. How are you at computer hacking? - Maddy's taught me a thing or two. - Maddy? My daughter. You have a daughter. - So, you're married? - Yeah. Well, you know, it's complicated. Isn't it always. Okay. Let's get to hacking. - I think I got something. - Whose computer terminal is it? Dr. Douglas Joslyn. Okay, let's bring up his medical history. He carries the latent gene for Gormon's Disease. Gormon's, that's kind of like Alzheimer's, right? Yeah, only worse. He must have been looking for a cure, trying to re-sequence the gene cluster that controls memory. The re-sequencing must have misfired, started blocking the neural pathways instead of opening them up. He must have engineered a virus to use as a delivery system, but then, that's how it became contagious. I'm not sure of anything anymore, and we're running out of time. - Elisabeth, you can do this. - No, I'm at 39 hours. Catatonia can set in as early as 36. All right, so we work fast. - Okay? - Okay. Just give me something to do. Elisabeth? This is my handwriting, but I don't remember writing these and I don't know who they are. But if I wrote them down, it must be because... Because they're important to me and I was afraid I was going to forget. Josh. Maddy. That's your daughter's name. Zoe. Jim. Your husband. - I don't remember. - I know. But you will. What if I don't? What happens if we both forget? What I feel for you is... Is more than just a memory. Anyway, I'm fine. Yeah, you are, aren't you? Why is that? Why? Sorry. So much for 12 hours. What's that? It's something Malcolm gave me for my cold. This is it. It has to be. There's something in this that he's given you that has a medicinal quality that blocks the pathogen. I mean, all we have to do is work out what it is. I'm not sure this is such a good idea, Maddy. Look, nobody said that you had to come with me. Either way I'm going in and I'm asking Lieutenant Washington what's going on. What about Zoe? We can't just leave her alone. How is she alone? You posted two guards outside her bedroom. Yeah, about that, if you wouldn't mind not mentioning that to my commanding officer, I'd really appreciate it. Lieutenant Washington? It's Maddy Shannon, I'd like to speak to you. Lieutenant Washington! - Not now, Maddy. - My parents... Reynolds, get her out of here, now! - Lieutenant, all she wants... - That was an order! You're not too good at following orders, are you, soldier? You're sick, Commander. You've been infected with something, it's got you confused. The war, it's over. Has been for a decade. We won. Don't you lie to me, Wash. I want answers. Please! You don't want to do that, sir. He's a soldier. He's one of your men. His name is Reynolds. Mark Reynolds. He came out here on the Fifth Pilgrimage. He came here because of you, because seven years ago, you led us to this place. So that we could have a second chance. What is this place? It's home. - This is home? - Yeah. All right, then where is my wife? - Show her to me! - Ayani's gone, Nathaniel. - No. - She died. No, you're lying to me, Wash. You know I would never lie to you about anything. This is your place, this is your home, and you've forgotten, that's all, but we're going to help you find a way to remember. - Ayani's dead. - Yeah. Why would I want to remember that? No! Natural antihistamines, traces of animal dung. No, there's nothing in that root that Malcolm gave you that would account for you being immune. - Animal dung? - Yeah. You want it back? I'd rather sneeze, but I don't want to get you sick, so... - Yes, you do. - What? I'm such an idiot. It's not this root, it's your cold. - My cold? - Yeah. Your virus is counteracting the one that Joslyn engineered. It's blocking the cell receptors so the pathogen can't get through. All I have to do is identify the serotype and we should be able to manufacture a treatment. I think I know a faster way. You feel sick yet? Not quite yet, no. Okay, take it easy. Take it easy. Commander. Can you tell me where you are? Can you tell me where you are? Terra Nova. You're going to experience some confusion, just for a few hours, while the memories sort themselves out. Based on the success we had at the outpost, you should be fine before dinner. Except for a wicked cold, right? No, I created a vaccine out of an inactive virus, so you shouldn't exhibit any symptoms. All right, we'll let you rest. - Lieutenant. - Yes, sir. You shot me. I did, sir. Good job. Thank you. - How are you feeling? - Elisabeth, yeah, I'm fine. Except for this headache. I must have taken a fall or something. Or something. Okay. - Mr. Shannon. - Sorry. Don't mind me. - Hi, angel. - Hi, Daddy. - Feeling better? - Yeah. What have you got here? - Dinosaurs. - Dinosaurs? Hey, come in here and hide with us. Look what Z made us. I'm teaching them how to walk. How they doing? Pretty well. We should enjoy this while we can. - Yeah. - Yeah. How are you, Mira? Medicine, power cell. No ammo? Taylor would lock me up if he even knew I was doing business with the Sixers. If he thought I was getting you weapons, he'd have me shot. I was able to find you more of that wild sorghum you're so keen on. Good as gold. This stuff makes the finest hooch. Oh, uh... Just one more thing. The next time you're able to establish contact with 2149, I need to get a message through. What's it about? It's just a kid who wants to buy his girlfriend's way through the portal. You're going soft? The kid, he's our new sheriff's son. You mean Shannon? That's right. I gave his boy a job in my bar. You know, keep your enemies close, and all that. But, I mean, if it's a problem I can tell him I just couldn't work it out. It's not a problem. It's an opportunity. One I plan to take advantage of.
