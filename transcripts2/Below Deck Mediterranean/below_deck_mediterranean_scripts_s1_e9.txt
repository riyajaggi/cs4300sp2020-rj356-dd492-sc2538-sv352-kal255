But he takes it too far. - Drop it. - Let's all drop it. Okay, we're dropping it. Where did that come from? - Ben said something to me, - and Daniel turned around, - And he was like, - "You know what?" Everywhere you fáááing go, "honey, you just cause drama." This is what happens in the galley all the time. Something's going on between me and Ben, and he steps in. - So what did you say - that we were gonna do? I said we were doing prawns for the main course. - You did say the shrimp - was the main... I said it a million times. He's taking Ben's side. You're a fáááing pleb junior deckhand. You have no business getting in the fáááing middle - of the chief steward - and the chef. - I still have respect for Ben. - Yeah. But this one now, he's going fáááing down. I will go out of my way now to annihilate that man. - Ah. - What am I even doing? I can't call him a man. He's fáááing 3'7". Let's go. - Dude, - here's the thing, though. She always says something to someone else. I'm just fed up - with her. - Look, mate, - if you're rude to her, - You won't be able - to help me anymore.

Where have you been? As far away as I can from Danny as possible. I get it, babe. Ben, would you mind if we have a cigarette? Even you know that wasn't nice. - What? - What Danny did? I didn't ask him - to do that. That came out of the blue. And secondly, all I asked you for tonight - was whether you would like - to be work colleagues - Or whether you'd like - to be friends. - I'd like a really - defined line. One I will be emotionally invested in, and one I will not. What's easier for me? It's probably easier for you - to be a work colleague - of mine. - Maybe I thought - we were friends, And for him, I was just somebody that he worked with. And that's fine too, but I want to know that then. - The reason I've been - getting upset Is because I feel like we're friends. - You see, when we're successful - work colleagues, We can be friends too. Okay. You're a work colleague then. - Okay, well, - I'll do that then. Wow. Let's reasonably look at this equation. We almost had a full-on war over the discrepancy of a word labeling a dish.

He was showing the other charter guests. - Yeah. - Okay. - I think I'm gonna go and have - a little chat with the captain. - Can you help me make his life - a living hell? - I already make his life - a living hell. I know. Had to mention now that we've joined forces. It's gonna be awesome. How's our list going? So here's what I got. "Be less chatty" with the guests. Focus more on my team "than the guests." Yeah, good. "Keep my phone away." "If a heated argument arises" in a different department, "just don't jump in." - Any other department - is just none of our business. - Yeah. - I think those are the big... The big key points. Yeah. So let's just work on that, and let's have a good charter. Now he's got no excuse - when he breaks those rules - that he wrote down - That he knows - I want him to do. And hold on to that list. Okay. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ Julia's got a boyfriend. Hannah's flirting with me. I don't know. It's a tough juggle. - Is she okay? - Have you seen her? - Yeah. - Yeah? She was livid last night.

Danny has been taking photos of charter guests, and this last charter, he has - been showing - other charter guests Photos of the girls from our previous charters. Showing the clients? [tense music] - Discretion is number one - in this industry, And, you know, the amount I've seen on the boats I've worked on, I don't talk about it because that's what they pay me for. That is such an invasion of privacy on a place that they come to feel secure and safe. - It's pretty much - the opposite - Of everything we do - in yachting, And it's just getting to be a little bit too much now. Usually that's something you'd get the boot for pretty quickly. So, I just wanted to give you the heads-up. Okay. Thank you. I've never had anybody that's as ethically professionally challenged as he is. Danny, Danny, Mark. Go for Daniel. Could you respond to the upper salon, please? - Sure thing, Captain. - Be there in a moment. Thank you. Oh, hey, Cap. - We need to sweep this up. - Okay, do you want to?

What happens on a yacht stays on a yacht. You shouldn't have pictures of any guests on your camera. Okay. Understood. I... I see what you're saying. I apologize. - When a new crew member - makes a rookie mistake, It's hard to discipline them - based on something they didn't - even know they were doing wrong. - You've come clean with me - about what's happened, And I appreciate that. But I am gonna take your phone - when we've got charter guests - on board. So tomorrow morning, before the charter guests arrive, - I expect you to come up to me - and hand me that phone. - And as soon as they step off, - I'll hand it back to you. - If you feel like - you need to take it, Then I understand. I do feel that way. I don't trust you enough that you'll do the right thing to keep your phone out of public view. It's like I can't win, but I'm not gonna give up.

You see that she flirts. Give me some chick advice. In two weeks, she'll be so far from you, and you probably won't see her again. She said she wanted to go to a music festival. She'd probably bring her boyfriend. Whatevs. Don't get me wrong; Julia crosses the line sometimes being very flirtatious and cute, but there's nothing sexual between Julia and Bobby. He's not her type, even if she were single. We're Facebook friends, - so I'm just gonna keep hoping - that they break up on it.

That's quite dangerous, actually. Daniel is really, really ill right now. - I really appreciate you - coming in, bro. - Sorry I couldn't - come in earlier. I was just at the beach. I get that no one really likes him on the boat, but this is actually quite a serious situation. Come knock or whatever. All right. Cool. Thanks, bro. All right, mate, take care.

Jen, Jen, Bryan, meet me on the bow. Copy that. - All right, Jen, - this would be a good time To practice your knots. Jen can't tie the knots that are required to do the basic jobs of the deckhand position. - Watch your fingers. - Sháá, sháá, sháá, sháá, Sháá, sháá. I'm losing it. It's like a plumber coming in - and not knowing how - to use a plunger. How do you tie a bowline? You do this. - Yeah. - So what's wrong with that one? I find the fastest way is, again, to go like this, right? - Bryan's definitely - a control freak. He wants me to do the bowline exactly how he wants it, but there are multiple ways. Unless you're the president of the United States, I hate being bossed around. And then this hand folds this line back up. Do... I want you to do that ten times just now. You're so pretty.
