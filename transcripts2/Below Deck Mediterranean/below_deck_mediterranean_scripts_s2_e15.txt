IT'S FINE. [laughing] - WELL, ON THE "SIROCCO," MOST OF THE CREW AGREED THAT CAPTAIN SANDY IS A REAL BADASS, BUT HANNAH SEEMED TO THINK HER MANAGEMENT STYLE WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS. TAKE A LOOK. - ARE YOU THE FIRST MATE? - NO, I'M THE CAPTAIN. BEING A CHARTER CAPTAIN, I HAVE A LOTTA RULES. I'M NOT A MICROMANAGER. THROW ALL THIS SH-- AWAY, FOLD THOSE TOWELS UP, AND GIVE ME THAT TRASH CAN. - I'M FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE WHEN CAPTAINS JUST BACK OFF AND LET ME DO MY JOB. I JUST PREFER TO PUT IT AWAY, LIKE, PROPERLY. - THAT'S NOT GONNA BE THE CASE. THIS IS THE MOST GREEN CREW I'VE EVER HAD. GO FORWARD. GO REVERSE. - BUT, LIKE, WE'RE ON CHARTER. THAT'S NOT THE TIME TO BE TRAINING PEOPLE. - WOULD YOU CHANGE? SHE'S IN A WORLD WHERE I AM IN CHARGE, AND SHE ISN'T. YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO YOUR COACH. - ALL RIGHT. UM, ABBY C.

FROM PHOENIX WANTS TO KNOW, "WE SAW HANNAH WAS FRUSTRATED "BY CAPTAIN SANDY'S BEHAVIOR. "DID YOU GUYS FEEL SHE WAS MICROMANAGING YOU?" WES, DID YOU? - HONESTLY, FROM THE GET GO, I THINK, UM, CAPTAIN SANDY WAS TRYING TO SET A STANDARD, AND SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD LIKE AND HOW IT'S MEANT TO BE RUN. NOW, ONCE YOU LEARN THESE THINGS, THEN SHE KINDA STEPPED BACK AND HAD US GO FOR IT. SO, SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE BOAT WAS BEING RUN IN THE WAY SHE LIKED IT AND UNDERSTOOD. - WELL, THE FIRST BIG FIGHT ON THE VESSEL CAME WHEN BOBBY'S ATTEMPT AT GETTING WOMEN TO BOARD HIS VESSEL SANK.

"WHY DIDN'T YOU HAVE BOBBY'S BACK AGAINST HANNAH? "DO YOU REALLY NOT REMEMBER WHAT HANNAH SAID TO YOU?" - UM, I DON'T REMEMBER WORD FOR WORD, AS I SAID, UM, ON CAMERA, BUT WHAT I GATHERED FROM THE MESSAGE WAS TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM BECAUSE HE EMBARRASSED ME THE NIGHT HE BROUGHT ME HERE WITH TWO OTHER GIRLS. THAT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING. - HE BROUGHT YOU TO "WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE." - YES, WITH TWO OTHER GIRLS. - YES. - SO, THREE GIRLS AND ME. - AND ANOTHER GUY. - I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I HAD A CHANCE OF DATING HIM. - AND-AND ANOTHER GUY. - YOU DIDN'T, THOUGH.

SO, I-I HAD SEATS, AND ME AND HANNAH-- - WITH ALL DUE, I DON'T LOVE YOU BRINGING STRANGE FANS TO THE CLUBHOUSE. [laughing] THIS ISN'T, LIKE, OH, SEND ME A D.M., AND I'LL TAKE YOU THE CLUBHOUSE. - SEND ME A P.M. - TO BE FAIR, WE WENT ON A DATE THE NIGHT BEFORE, AND WE HIT IT OFF. - OKAY. - AND HE SAID, "ACTUALLY, I WILL BRING YOU." - OKAY, HANNAH, UM-- BUT YOU COULDA LEFT. YOU COULD'VE WALKED AWAY. - I ACTUALLY TRIED TO LEAVE, AND YOU WERE LIKE, "NO, PLEASE STAY. I'M ACTUALLY INTO YOU, "AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT THESE GIRLS."

"I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU, "BUT IF YOU WANNA COME--" I CAME WITH THREE OF MY FRIENDS. HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY, "HI," TO ME WHEN I ARRIVED, AND BEN CAME RIGHT UP TO ME, AND I-I DIDN'T THINK I WAS THAT IMPORTANT. YOU WERE REALLY BUSY WITH YOUR FANS AT THE TIME. SO-- AND DIDN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE ME OR MY FRIENDS WHEN WE ARRIVED. - HALF OF THAT IS TRUE. - SO, YOU-YOU WENT HOME WITH BEN THAT NIGHT. - YEAH, YEAH. [laughing] - YES, UM, CHRISTINE C.

FROM MICHIGAN SAID, "DO YOU HAVE REGRETS ABOUT NOT GOING TO CAPTAIN SANDY FIRST?" WHY'D YOU SHOW BOBBY FIRST? - WHY DID I SHOW BOBBY? I MEAN, I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SANDY, HANDS DOWN, BUT, IN ALL HONESTY, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS-- I COME ACROSS IN THE MASTER CABIN. THE THING WAS GOING OFF. I PICKED IT UP. IT WAS PART OF THE BOAT'S PROPERTY. I WALKED DOWN TO THE MAIN SALOON. BOBBY WAS THE FIRST PERSON I RAN INTO, SHOWED HIM, AND IT WAS A LIGHTHEARTED THING. IT WASN'T-- I WAS NOT GOING OUT OF MY WAY TO BE VINDICTIVE OR MALICIOUS. OTHERWISE, I WOULD'VE TAKEN STRAIGHT TO CAPTAIN SANDY. - UM-- - DID YOU NOT THINK IT WAS A LITTLE BIT MALICIOUS TO TAKE IT OFF THE BOAT AND SHOW THE CREW FOR, LIKE, TEN HOURS?

I CAN'T STUDY SOMETHING, HAVE A PASSION FOR IT, AND THEN ALSO ENJOY WORKING ON YACHTS? - A LOT OF US HAVE-- - UH, YOU HAVE TO HAVE MONEY. IT'S-- YOU HAVE TO HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE COURSES. - I GUESS. I MEAN, I JUST WOULD GO, LIKE, TO L.A. AND GO TO, UH, CASTINGS LIKE A NORMAL-- - I'M SORRY. - A LOT OF US HAVE EDUCATIONS OUTSIDE YACHTING. - SO DO I. - BUT WAIT, WHY DID YOU SIGN UP FOR THE SHOW? - YOU WERE A YACHTIE FOR FOUR YEARS. YOU WERE A YACHTIE FOR FOUR YEARS. - YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE I JUMPED FROM FILM SCHOOL AND WAS LIKE, HEY, I WANNA BE ON A BOAT. - UM, BOBBY, WHY WAS IT OKAY FOR YOU TO HOOK UP WITH A CHARTER GUEST ON THE LAST CHARTER WHEN IT ISN'T OKAY FOR HANNAH TO DO SO WITH JASON? - WELL, UH, I-I THINK I SAID IT ON, YOU KNOW, ON THE SHOW. - YEAH. - I WAS NEVER PISSED OFF. I DIDN'T CARE THAT HANNAH HOOKED UP WITH-WITH JASON. I COULD-COULD GIVE TWO SH-- BECAUSE THAT'S JUST ME. I-- LIKE, IF I FIND-- IT-IT'S-- IF-IF THERE'S A LOVE INTEREST IN A CHARTER GUEST, GO FOR IT. BUT WHAT MADE IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT, IS-- [laughing] - NO, NO, NO. - YEAH. - I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S-- - NO, THAT IS SO AGAINST THE LAW. LIKE, THAT IS-- - I UNDERSTAND, BUT THAT'S-- - THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO. - BUT THAT IS BOBBY'S-- THIS WAS THE WAY BOBBY THOUGHT, AND I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT. - YEAH, UH, AND, LIKE, I DIDN'T CARE, YOU KNOW? - DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. - WHAT I CARED ABOUT WAS-- - NO, IT DOESN'T. - WAS THE FACT THAT, LIKE-- ABOUT THE IPAD STUFF. ANYWAYS HAVE YOU SEEN PAULA, AGAIN? - YEAH. - YOU HAVE? - HA-HA, YEAH. - WELL, JASON CAME TO AN EPISODE OF "WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE," AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T GO IN FOR THE KISS. - YEAH. - UH, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THAT? - HE LIKES STIRRING THE POT A LOT, SO-- - ARE YOU TWO STILL HANGING OUT AT ALL? - NO, LOOK, HE'S-- WE HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY, AND I, YOU KNOW, I'LL SAY, "HI," TO HIM ON FACEBOOK MESSENGER, BUT, YEAH, WE DEFINITELY DON'T DATE. - UM, CAPTAIN SANDY... UM, AFTER HEARING WHAT JASON SAID ON "WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE" AND WATCHING THE SEASON, WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE, NOW? - AFTER WATCHING THE SEASON, HANNAH LIED TO ME AND VERY DISAPPOINTED. IT'S LIKE-- I THINK IT'S THEIR JOB. IT SEEMS LIKE ADAM AND HANNAH LIES, AND I-- YOU KNOW, IT REALLY AFFECTS ME. IT'S LIKE, I CREATE THIS COMRADERY IN A CREW, SO THEY CAN TELL ME THE TRUTH. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUR BEHAVIOR IS OKAY, BUT TO TELL ME THE TRUTH IS A RESPECT. - AND SO, WHAT DID I LIE TO YOU ABOUT? - YOU TOLD ME HE KISSED YOU. - BUT HOW WOULD YOU-- SO, YOU'RE BELIEVING JASON OVER ME, THEN? - WELL, I BELIEVE WHAT I WATCHED. I MEAN, I-- YOU KNOW? - OBVIOUSLY, YOU RUN INTO THE ROOM, THERE. - WELL, WHAT DO YOU SEE? - YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. YOU SAW THE DOOR SHUT. - HE TOLD ME AND LAUREN THAT. - FOR ME, IT'S ABOUT TURNING-TURNING THEM AROUND AND GO, "HEY, YOU GOTTA GET BACK ON THE RIGHT PATH "AS MUCH AS YOU DESIRE." - YEAH, AND YOU DID WITH ME. IT FELT ACTUALLY VERY EMPOWERING WHEN WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION. - YEAH. - YOU'RE LIKE, "ADAM, YOU'RE SCREWIN' UP. "YOU NEED TO FIX THIS." - RIGHT, EXACTLY, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN PEOPLE. - IS-IS-IS THAT ALL THAT HAPPENED? A KISS? - YES. - YES, ALL RIGHT. - UP NEXT... YOU TOLD HER YOU LOVED HER RIGHT WHEN YOU MET HER. THIS HAS TO HURT ON SOME LEVEL. I MEAN-- ♪♪♪ - BACK WITH THE "BELOW DECK MED" - BACK WITH THE "BELOW DECK MED" SEASON 2 REUNION.

I'M SPENDING A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH WES. WHAT'S A GIRL TO DO? - I HAD BIG PLANS FOR YOU BEFORE THAT AND THAT SHOWED UP HERE. YEAH. - ADAM I MET THREE WEEKS BEFORE WE JOINED THE YACHT, BUT THEN I GOT ON THE BOAT, AND I FELL FOR WES. - SHE TOLD ME SHE'S NOT INTO HIM WHATSOEVER. I GOT ALL THE TEXTS. "HOPEFULLY, WE CAN SNEAK INTO THE SAME HOTEL ROOM OUR LAST NIGHT." THESE TEXTS WERE THE EXACT SAME NIGHT THAT SHE WAS MAKING OUT WITH WES. YOU NEED TO KNOW THE GIRL IS A F---ING LIAR. READ THAT, 3:45 A.M., THAT WATCH. MALIA AND I HAD A PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP. - WE WEREN'T EXCLUSIVE OR ANYTHING, SO I CAN'T BLAME HER FOR IT. IT'D BE AWESOME TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO EXPLORE WHAT WE HAVE FURTHER, AWAY FROM "SIROCCO." - F--- YOU, ADAM. LIKE, THIS GIRL IS GOING FOR THE GOOD GUY. - WOW. - OOPS. [laughing] - POWERFUL-POWERFUL WORDS. [collective chatter] - UM, OKAY, SO, I WANNA HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW MALIA AND ADAM MET. - WE ACTUALLY MET IN OUR STCW IN FORT LAUDERDALE. - YEAH. - OKAY. - WHICH WAS PURE COINCIDENCE. - SHE SAT IN THE FRONT OF THE CLASS, AND I-I DROOLED OVER THE BACK OF THE HEAD MOST OF THE DAY. - AWW. - YOU DID. BUT DID ANYTHING HAPPEN BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU? - NO, HE WAS ACTUALLY A TOTAL JERK. I WAS LIKE, "HEY, ADAM, LIKE, I'M MALIA. WE'RE BOTH GOING TO 'BELOW DECK,'" AND HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH, COOL." - IS IT 'CAUSE I DIDN'T ASK FOR YOUR NUMBER? I WAS BEING REALLY POLITE, I SWEAR. - SO, NOTHING-SO NOTHING HAPPENED BEFORE YOU WENT ON THE CHARTER? - WE KISSED. - YOU KISSED. - YEAH. - IS THAT PHYSICAL? - IT'S-- - PHYSICAL. - IS THAT A PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP NOWADAYS? - YOU CAN-- YOU CAN, YOU KNOW-- - IT'S PHYSICAL. IT'S-- [laughing] - WE TOUCHED. - OH, WAIT A MINUTE. - I MEAN, YOU TOLD ME SOMETHING WAY DIFFERENT. - YEAH, I WAS GOING TO SAY. - YOU TOLD BOTH OF US SOMETHING WAY DIFFERENT ON CAMERA. - THERE WAS A CONNECTION. - WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE, BUT YOU TOLD US SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. - THERE WAS A CONNECTION? - YEAH, YEAH. - YEAH, FOR SURE. - THERE WAS. - MM-HMM. - AND DID YOU EXPECT THAT THAT CONNECTION WOULD CONTINUE, AND BLOOM, AND FLOWER ON "SIROCCO?" - I HAD HOPED IT WOULD 'CAUSE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I THOUGHT MAYBE I HAD A CHANCE ON A BOAT WITH, UH, WITH SOMEONE. [laughing] 'CAUSE HERE I'VE BEEN TRAVELING AROUND FOR TEN YEARS WITH NO POTENTIAL, UH, CHANCE OF MEETING SOMEONE, SO-- - IT'S HARD TO MEET GIRLS IN A VAN. - IT IS. - LET ME ASK SOMETHING ELSE. YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW THAT YOU ONLY KISSED, BUT, ON THE SHOW, YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD TOLD HER THAT YOU LOVED HER. - IT WAS, UM, IT WAS ONE OF THOSE FEELINGS, MAN. IT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW? POPS TOLD ME-- - HOW MANY VODKAS WERE YOU IN WHEN YOU TOLD HER THAT YOU LOVED HER? - LISTEN, POPS TOLD ME THAT THE MOMENT YOU MEET SOMEONE-- LIKE, HIS WIFE, MY MOM, THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 40 YEARS, AND HE KNEW IT THE DAY HE MET HER, SO-- - SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME-- DID YOU KNOW THE DAY YOU MET HER THAT YOU LOVED HER? - FELT LIKE IT, FELT LIKE IT. - AWW. - WOW! - VERY SWEET. - WELL, THAT BUBBLE BURST. - BUT THAT'S CRAZY, BUT THAT WAS CRAZY, RIGHT? SO-- - NO, BUT-BUT I-- BUT YOU'RE REALLY DOWNPLAYING WHATEVER HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU IN THAT CLASS. - NO, REALLY, IT WAS... [laughing] I THINK, TOO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE GOT ONBOARD, AND THIS EXPERIENCE WAS VERY INTENSE. - YEAH. - IT-- EVERYTHING-- IT'S HEIGHTENED. - NO ONE COULD'VE PULLED THAT OFF. - DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THIS RELATIONSHIP A SECRET FROM EVERYBODY? - IT WAS A-- - UH, I WAS REALLY STRONG GOING ON, AND THEN I WAS LIKE, THERE'S NO WAY. - IT WAS A SILLY THOUGHT. LIKE, IT WAS A-- WE REALLY THOUGHT IT COULD, AND-AND ONCE WE GOT STARTED, AND THE CAMERAS WERE ROLLING, IT WAS JUST LIKE, "OKAY, THIS OBVIOUSLY ISN'T GONNA PAN OUT WELL." - YEAH. - BUT YOU WERE KISSING ON THE BOAT, TOO. - YEAH. - YEAH, YEAH. - UM, DO YOU GUYS REGRET LYING TO EVERYONE ABOUT THE EXTENT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP? - YEAH. - IT WOULD'VE BEEN WAY EASIER HAD WE JUST COME OUT AND SAID IT. - YEAH, I THINK IT WAS STUPID. - YOU KNOW, AND THEY COULD'VE JUST HAD A RELATIONSHIP THE WHOLE TIME. IT WOULD'VE BEEN-- IT WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT-- A LOT EASIER FOR WES. [chuckles] - I THINK IT WAS STUPID. YOU KNOW, WE BOTH WERE JUST-- LIKE, OUR THOUGHTS BEHIND IT WASN'T LYING TO EVERYONE. WE THOUGHT LET'S JUST NOT BRING IT UP SO THAT EVERYONE HAS A CLEAN SLATE WHEN WE BOARD THE BOAT. YOU KNOW, BOBBY AND LAUREN JOINED, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS AIRED, AND WE WERE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST KEEP IT SECRET." WE DIDN'T WANNA LIE, BUT THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY WRONG OF US. - SO, WES, AFTER WATCHING THE SEASON, HOW DOES IT FEEL KNOWING THAT MALIA LIED TO YOU THE WHOLE TIME? - OH, SHE NEVER LIED TO ME. SHE NEVER LIED TO ME. - SHE DIDN'T? - NO, NEVER LIED TO ME. - UH-UH. - I MEAN, SHE-- WE WERE ALL-- BOTH PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE WERE BOTH GUNNING FOR THE SAME GIRL. WE BOTH HAD FEELINGS FOR THE SAME GIRL. - BUT DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HER-- DID YOU KNOW THAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE LOVED HER? - NO, I NEVER TOLD ANY-- I NEVER GOT TOLD ANYTHING, AND THAT'S WHY I'M A BIT CONFUSED. I THINK, IF ADAM REALLY DID LOVE HER, HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME FROM THE BEGINNING. - AND I-I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T. - AND I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T. - I KEEP-- - 'CAUSE, I MEAN, THEN I WOULD HAVE CHANGED MY WHOLE SORT OF GAME PLAN. - I KNOW, I KEEP GOIN' BACK IN TIME. I'M LIKE, WHY DIDN'T I JUST TELL WES DAY ONE? - YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD'VE JUST CHANGED THE WHOLE BALLGAME. - AND HE WOULD'VE BEEN, YOU KNOW, HE-- - WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU? - I DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE WE HAD A-- - 'CAUSE THEY DECIDED NOT TO TELL THE WHOLE CREW. - YEAH. - SO, HE CAN'T THEN TELL WES AND THEN TELL WES-- - NO, NO, HE WAITED-- HE WAITED FOR THE LAST DAY OF CHARTER, AFTER THE SIX WEEKS. - YEAH, YEAH. - HE COULD'VE SEEN FROM THE MOMENT THAT WE STARTED HITTING IT OFF OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, TWO OR THREE WEEKS IN, HE COULD HAVE CHANGED THE WHOLE BALLGAME. - ARE-ARE YOU GUYS-- IS THE REST OF THE CREW-- WERE YOU UPSET TO KNOW THAT THEY HAD BEEN KEEPING THIS FROM YOU? - I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL WE WERE DONE FILMING. [laughing] - WE WOULD'VE KEPT OUR THING A SECRET, IF WE WERE KEEPING SECRETS. - I THINK-- I THINK SHOCKED IS MORE THE WORD. - SHOCKED IS MORE THE WORD. - YEAH. - ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TWO-- WHEN, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU FIRST WALKED ON THE BOAT, AND-AND YOU SAID HELLO TO EACH OTHER. [chuckles] - WHEN YOU WATCH BACK, YEAH. - AND NOW WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW. - MY ACTING CLASSES DIDN'T PAY OFF. - AND, LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SO-- YOU'RE SO STRAIGHT-FACED. - WE DIDN'T TAKE ACTING CLASSES. [laughing] - MALIA, WE GOT A LOT OF FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE THINKING THAT YOU WERE LEADING BOTH OF THESE GUYS ON. - THAT'S FAIR. - AND-AND WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? UM, LAURA K. SAID, UM, "WHY'D YOU KEEP LEADING ADAM AND WES ON "AFTER YOU TOLD THEM YOU WERE DONE WITH THEM? "THEN YOU WENT ON TO KEEP LEADING ADAM ON "BY TEXTING HIM THE SAME NIGHT YOU MADE OUT WITH WES "ON, UM, ANCHOR WATCH." - YEAH, YOU KNOW, I THINK I DID MY FAIR SHARE OF LEADING THEM ON, BUT HONESTLY, THE SITUATION WHEN YOU'RE ON A YACHT FOR SIX WEEKS, YOUR EMOTIONS ARE SO HEIGHTENED, AND EVERYTHING IS, LIKE, IT'S SO EXTREME. WE DON'T GET TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE. WE DON'T GET TO GO HAVE DATES AND JUST GO OFF AND JUST BE OURSELVES AND FIND OUT WHO WE ARE WITHOUT CAMERAS. SO, I GENUINELY HAD FEELINGS FOR BOTH OF THESE GUYS. THEY'RE BOTH AMAZING GUYS FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS. - ADAM, DID YOU TELL WES THAT YOU HAD A PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH MALIA? - AT-AT THE END OF THE CHARTER, AT THE END OF THE SEASON. - AS I WALKED OFF, YEAH. - YEAH, IT WAS JUST, LIKE, WHY DID I WAIT THE ENTIRE TIME? AND EVEN THEN, I SHOULD'VE JUST SAID, YOU KNOW-- - OKAY, BUT YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU JUST KISSED. - IT WAS A HEAVY KISS. [laughing] - WHAT? - BUT WHAT ARE-- KISSING-KISSING LEADS TO-- KISSING LEADS TO-- - SERIOUSLY? - ADAM AND I HAVE NEVER HAD SEX, IF EVERYONE'S WONDERING. - YOU GUYS, I DIDN'T-- WE'VE NEVER HAD SEX. I CAN TELL YOU THAT, RIGHT NOW. [laughing] - YOU'VE NEVER HAD SEX. - NO. - NO, WE HAVEN'T. - WOW. - HOW DO YOU CLASSIFY SEX? [laughing] - WHAT'S SEX? - I'VE NEVER HAD IT. I DON'T KNOW. - YEAH. - HE'S A VIRGIN. - I'M A VIRGIN. - HE'S WAITING FOR MARRIAGE. - SO, WES AND MALIA, WHAT'S THE STATUS OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP, NOW? - I THINK THE STATUS IS, WE KEEP OUR PRIVATE LIFE PRIVATE. [laughing] I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT'S MEANT TO BE. - WELL, I MEAN, YOU'RE ON A REALITY SHOW. - YOU'RE ON A REALITY SHOW. - YEAH. - YOU'RE-- ARE YOU STILL TOGETHER? - UM-- - ARE YOU TOGETHER? - HAVE YOU LABELED IT? - YES OR NO? - IS IT LABELED? - YEAH. - HAVE YOU BRANDED IT OR NOT? - COME ON, LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. - NO, BUT ARE YOU-- ARE YOU GUYS SEEING EACH OTHER? I MEAN-- - EVERY NOW AND THEN. - EVERY NOW AND THEN-- WHENEVER WE FEEL IT. [laughing] - WE BOTH-- YOU KNOW, IT'S YACHTING. WE BOTH WORK IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. WE'RE IN DIFFERENT PLACES, AND WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IN TOUCH AS MUCH AS WE CAN. - IN TOUCH. - LET ME ASK YOU THIS. - OH, MY. - YOU'RE IN NEW YORK. ARE YOU STAYING IN THE SAME ROOM TONIGHT? - HE'S A COMEDIAN. - YEP. [laughing] - THANKS, MAX. - EH? - I THINK-I THINK IT'S A SITUATION WHERE IT'S, UM, THANK GOODNESS THAT WE GOT OFF THE BOAT 'CAUSE I THINK, FROM THERE, YOU ACTUALLY-- WITH THE CAMERAS, AND THE INTERVIEWING, AND EVERYTHING, IT KIND OF FALLS AWAY, AND IT ALLOWS US TO EXPLORE AND GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. - OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL. I HEARD YOU GUYS ARE OFFICIALLY A COUPLE. SO-- - GEEZ, YOU GUYS. - SO, WE HAVE TO SAY IT. - JUST SAY YES OR NO. - BUT, I MEAN, LIKE, AFTER THIS, WE'RE GOING TO SOUTH AFRICA TOGETHER. - WE'RE GOING TO SOUTH AFRICA. - YEAH. - YES OR NO? - OKAY, SO, YOU'RE GOING TO SOUTH AFRICA TOGETHER. - YEAH, WE ARE. - OKAY, SO, YOU'RE A COUPLE. - AND THEY'RE A GREAT COUPLE AT THAT. [chuckles] - ARE-- IS-IS SHE MEETING YOUR FAMILY? - I MET HER FAMILY. SHE'S MEETING MY FAMILY. - OKAY. - YEAH, BEEN TO HER-HER HOMETOWN AND EVERYTHING. SO, YEAH. - DON'T LIE TO DADDY, OKAY? I'M GONNA FIND OUT. [laughing] - DON'T LIE TO DADDY. - IT'S JUST BEST TO KEEP IT PRIVATE. - I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOUR REACTION IS TO HEARING THAT-- - THEY LOOK GREAT TOGETHER. THEY REALLY DO. NO, I-I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR THEM. - WE ALL THREE HUNG OUT LAST NIGHT. - YEAH, WE ALL WENT OUT AND HAD DRINKS LAST NIGHT. IT'S-IT'S FINE. - DON'T START RUMORS, MALIA. [laughing] - WHERE DID YOU STAY LAST NIGHT, ADAM? - BUT HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. - BUT, IN ALL SERIOUSNESS-- HOLD ON. IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, YOU TOLD HER YOU LOVED HER RIGHT WHEN YOU MET HER. THIS HAS TO HURT ON SOME LEVEL. I MEAN-- - NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S-- I'VE WATCHED THIS GROW, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THE-THE FACT OF THE MATTER WAS, WE WENT AND DID THIS RIGHT BEFORE DOING A REALITY TELEVISION SHOW. WHAT KINDA IDIOT THINKS HE'S GONNA FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ON A REALITY TELEVISION SHOW? LIKE-- - THIS ONE. - THIS ONE. - THIS ONE. WELL, THEY DID. - SO, YOU KNOW-- - SAME GUY THAT'S PUTS ONIONS IN SOUP. - IT WORKED OUT GREAT FOR THE-- FOR THE TWO OF THEM, YOU KNOW? AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR THE BOTH OF YOU. - THEY'RE ACTUALLY A VERY SWEET COUPLE, IF I CAN SAY. [laughing] - OKAY, WE GOTTA TAKE A BREAK. MORE WITH MALIA AND HER BACHELORS WHEN WE COME BACK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. NEXT... HAS EVERYBODY ON THIS BOAT HOOKED UP WITH EACH OTHER AT ONE POINT? - AHH... - HANNAH AND BOBBY? - NO. - NO. - WE HAVE. - OH, GOD. ♪♪♪ - BACK WITH THE CREW - BACK WITH THE CREW OF THE "SIROCCO." OKAY, CAROLINE G. FROM SYOSSET SAYS, "HAS EVERYBODY ON THIS BOAT HOOKED UP "WITH EACH OTHER AT ONE POINT? "HANNAH AND BOBBY, HAVE YOU TWO HOOKED UP?" - NO. - NO. - YES, WE HAVE. [laughing] - OH, GOD. - WE HAVE. - YOU HAVE? - YEAH. - TELL US ABOUT IT. - WE'VE SLEPT TOGETHER? - NO, WE DIDN'T SLEEP TOGETHER. - IT WAS A KISS. - YOU JUST THREW-- [laughing] - THEY GOT PHYSICAL. - THEY HAD A PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP. - WHAT'S A PHYSICAL-- - WE KISSED. - YOU'RE REFUTING THIS. - OH, NO, LOOK, I-- LOOK, I ALWAYS KISS PEOPLE ON THE LIPS WHEN I'M DRUNK, ALWAYS. - I'VE SEEN SOME INCIDENTS. - HANNAH AND MAX, HAVE YOU GUYS HOOKED UP? MADE OUT? - NO, NO. - NO, BUGSY AND MAX? - NO. - NO. - BUGSY AND BOBBY? - AHH... [laughing] - BROTHER FROM ANOTHER MOTHER, RIGHT HERE, ANDY. - YOU DO THAT WITH YOUR BROTHER? [laughing] - IT'S A JOKE. - UM, MALIA AND HANNAH? - NO. - PROBABLY. - WE HAD A KISS ON THE MOUTH, LIKE ALWAYS. - MALIA AND MAX? - NO. - NO. - UH-UH. - HANNAH AND ADAM? - NO. - NO. - WELL, I-I-- - WELL, ON THE SHOW, YOU HAD A LITTLE-- BUT THAT WASN'T MAKING OUT. - THAT, TO ME, THAT'S JUST SO NOT SEXUAL. - LAUREN AND ADAM? - NO. - NO. [laughing] - CALL OUT. - DUN-DUN-DUN. - L.A. - IT WAS A-- IT WAS JUST A KISS. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING WITH? JUST A KISS, RIGHT? EVERYONE IS SAYING-- EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING IT. - JUST A KISS. - WE HAD A VERY PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP. - UM, LEAH D. FROM BALTIMORE SAID, "MALIA, DID IT PISS YOU OFF "THAT ADAM'S REACTION TO YOU CHOOSING WES "WAS TO SLUT SHAME YOU? "HE CALLED YOU DISGUSTING AND A SLUT." - UH, YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T PISS ME OFF. I WAS ACTUALLY MORE JUST A LITTLE BUMMED. I THINK ADAM'S CHARACTER IS ACTUALLY A LOT GREATER THAN THAT. SO, TO SEE HIM TO RESULT TO THAT, OBVIOUSLY, IT JUST IS A TESTAMENT TO HOW HE HURT WAS. SO-- - UM, OUR FRIEND CHRISSY TEIGEN POSTED A POLL ON TWITTER. - YEAH. [laughing] - "WATCHING 'BELOW DECK.' IS IT WORSE TO GIVE A WEDGIE AT 35 OR CRY THAT YOU RECEIVED ONE?" SO, THE RESULTS WERE 45% SAID GIVE A WEDGIE. 55% SAID CRY OVER ONE. 77,000 PEOPLE VOTED. [laughing] - OH, MY GOD. - JUST SO YOU KNOW. - UM, DEBBIE M. FROM MIAMI WANTS TO KNOW, "ADAM, WHY DIDN'T YOU EXPOSE MALIA AS SOON AS YOU REALIZED THE TEXTS WERE FROM THE SAME NIGHT SHE HOOKED UP WITH WES?" DID YOU STILL THINK YOU HAD A CHANCE? - YEAH. - YOU DID. - YEAH. - WOW. - HE WAS HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE. - ON THE LAST SLIVER OF HOPE, YOU KNOW? - WELL, LIFE FOR THE EXTERIOR CREW WAS SMOOTH SAILING UNTIL WES WAS TASKED WITH CHOOSING A LEAD DECKHAND, MAKING HIS MATES WONDER IF HE WAS THINKING WITH HIS DECK. WATCH. [laughing] - WHO IS YOUR LEAD DECKHAND? - I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS CHOOSING A RANKING THING. - WELL, YOU HAVE TO. - MALIA, DONE. - I DON'T THINK KISSING ON ANCHOR WATCH WAS THE WISEST DECISION. - YOU SHALL BE OUR LEAD DECKHAND. - CAPTAIN SANDY THOUGHT SO? - WE BOTH FIGURED OUT THAT THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE. YOU'RE NOW LOOKING AT THE NEW DECKHAND, MALIA. - I'M AFRAID IT'S GONNA BE VIEWED LIKE I EARNED IT BY KISSING THE BOSS. - WE HEARD A RUMOR THAT YOU AND MALIA WERE MAKING OUT. - YEAH, IT'S TRUE. - THAT IS THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. MY WORK ETHIC WAS NEVER SEEN BECAUSE HE'S SO FAR UP YOUR ASS. - BASICALLY, YOU'RE TELLING ME, IS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO EARN THE TITLE BECAUSE I'M A CUTE, ATTRACTIVE FEMALE DECKHAND. [laughing] - THE DECISION IS MADE. IT'S OVER. - MALIA IS LEAD DECKHAND, AND THAT PISSES ME OFF. - HMM... [laughing] - ALL RIGHT, SO, CAPTAIN, UM, CAPTAIN SANDY, UM, SUZANNE FROM NORTH CAROLINA WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU WOULD STILL BACK WES' DECISION TO PROMOTE MALIA KNOWING THEY HAD HOOKED UP? - UH, YES. - YOU WOULD. - YES, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WES IS PROFESSIONAL. AND HE REALLY BASED HIS DECISION ON THE PERFORMANCE. AND, YOU KNOW, MALIA WAS ALWAYS ON THE BRIDGE ASKING QUESTIONS. BOBBY NEVER REALLY DID, AND I EVEN TEXTED BOBBY. I HAD NO IDEA YOU WANTED TO BE A YACHT CAPTAIN, BECAUSE IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN, I WOULD HAVE ENCOURAGED YOU TO COME ON THE BRIDGE MORE. BUT MALIA WAS ALWAYS ASKING ABOUT CHARTS, AND SO I THINK HE BASED HIS DECISION ON THAT. - UH, WES, WHY DID YOU TELL EVERYONE IT WAS, UH, CAPTAIN SANDY'S DECISION TO APPOINT MALIA-- [sighs] - DO YOU KNOW WHAT? - WHEN SHE LET YOU MAKE THE DECISION? - YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS, UH, PROBABLY A POOR CHOICE OF WORDING, BUT IT WAS, WAS WE AGREED ABOUT IT. WE WENT TO THE BRIDGE, AND IF CAPTAIN DIDN'T AGREE WITH ME, SHE WOULD HAVE SAID, "WES, I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU. "CHOOSE SOMEONE ELSE." SO WHEN I WENT DOWN TO CONFRONT THE BOYS AND SAYING IT WAS OUR DECISION, IT WAS OUR AGREEANCE THAT MALIA WAS-- - AGREEMENT. - BUT SANDY JUST SAID, "WHOEVER YOU PICK, I'LL-I'LL BACK YOU." - HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR DECISION. - WELL, EXCEPT FOR YOU. [laughing] - YEAH, BUT YOU COULD'VE PICKED ANYONE. - EXCEPT FOR YOU. - YEAH, I COULD HAVE. - I DIDN'T WANT IT, MATE. I DIDN'T WANT IT. - YOU COULDN'T TIE A LINE. - MAX, UH, VANESSA FROM BURLINGTON, VERMONT SAID, "DO YOU RESPECT MALIA AS LEAD DECKHAND, OR DO YOU THINK SHE GOT THE JOB BY BEING WES' GIRLFRIEND?" - I MEAN, IT'S HARD BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, MALIA IS REALLY GOOD AT WHAT SHE DOES, BUT THE FACT WAS, YOU KNOW, YOU-YOU GUYS WERE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER THAT, YOU KNOW, POOR OLD BOBBY HERE WAS-- YOU KNOW, WE-- UH, IT WAS ALWAYS ME AND BOBBY WORKING TOGETHER KIND OF THING, AND THESE TWO WOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER ALL THE TIME. SO OBVIOUSLY, WES DIDN'T REALLY GET TO SEE MUCH OF WHAT BOBBY IS DOING. - SUZANNE J. WANTS TO KNOW WHY BOBBY IS SUCH A MAN BABY ABOUT THE LEAD DECKHAND POSITION AND HIS CHANCES WITH MALIA. "HE'S ALWAYS WHINING." - I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYBODY THINKS I'M ALWAYS WHINING. - 'CAUSE YOU ARE. - 'CAUSE YOU ARE. - DON'T CHIME IN ON THIS. - YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL SAY BOBBY IS A-- BOBBY'S A GREAT GUY. - HE IS VERY COOL. - THE LEAD DECKHAND THING DID NOT SHOW TRUE BOBBY. YOU KNOW, LIKE, HE WAS UPSET, AND HE WAS HURT, AND HE'S JUST AS GOOD OF A WORKER, IF NOT BETTER. SO, IT'S-IT'S-- - THAN YOU? NO WAY. YOU'RE WAY BETTER. - AND LOOK, FROM-FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, FROM A LEAD-- OR FROM THE BOATSWAIN-- - YOU DESERVED YOUR POSITION. YOU DESERVED IT. - AND-AND HE'S DRIVING BOATS, NOW. - AND HE'S DRIVING BOATS. - AND HE'S DRIVING BOATS. - YEAH. - SO, YEAH, FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN NOW, AS BEING A BOATSWAIN AND WATCHING THESE GUYS ON DECK, I'VE NEVER SAID A BAD THING ABOUT EITHER OF THEM-- ANY OF THEM. I'VE ONLY BROUGHT THEM UP, AND THAT'S SO GREAT FOR ME, ACTUALLY, LOOKING AFTER THE SEASON AND SEEING THEM ALL STILL BEING SO SUCCESSFUL IN INDUSTRY. MALIA HAS GOT 100 TON-- ABOUT TO GET 200 TON. BOBBY IS WORKING COUNTLESS CHARTERS-- ABOUT TO GET HIS 100 TON. - WHAT AM I DOING, MATE? - AND MAX IS FREELANCING-- - YEAH, MAX. [collective chatter] I LOVE THEM. - COMING UP... "BUGS, DID YOU ACTUALLY EVER LIKE OR RESPECT HANNAH AT ALL? "DO YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN HER?" - WE'RE BACK WITH - WE'RE BACK WITH THE "BELOW DECK MED" - WE'RE BACK WITH THE "BELOW DECK MED" SEASON TWO REUNION. THE INTERIOR CREW STARTED OUT AS A UNITED FRONT, BUT WHEN HANNAH STARTED DELEGATING MORE TASKS, THINGS BETWEEN THE STEWS BOILED OVER.H. - WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO LEAD SERVICE FOR THESE GUYS? - HANNAH IS JUST TOO QUICK TO GIVE UP HER RESPONSIBILITIES. HANNAH DOES MORE TALKING THAN WORKING. - I'LL COME BACK AT, LIKE, QUARTER TO. - OKAY. WHEN I WAS A CHIEF STEW, I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT MY GIRLS TO SET UP A HUGE EVENT BY THEMSELVES. - MAYBE BUGSY SHOULD BE THE CHIEF STEW. - DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE WE'RE DOING A LOT OF EXTRA WORK? - OH, YOU'RE ONLY NOTICING THIS NOW? SHE'S BEING ABSOLUTELY LAZY. AND HAS NOT SET ONE TABLE THIS ENTIRE SEASON, NOT ONE TABLE. YOU'VE BEEN A LOUSY CHIEF STEW. I DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PULLING YOUR WEIGHT. - OKAY. - DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANNA SAY TO ME? - NO. - OKAY, THANK YOU. - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I WAS JUST TOUCHING BASE WITH LAUREN ABOUT ALL THE SH-- SHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT ME. - I'M NOT GONNA LIE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD. - DON'T TAKE A SECOND STEW JOB, IF YOU WANNA BE CHIEF STEW. - THIS IS CHILDISH AS SH--. - SHOO. [laughing] - UM, SO, HERE'S A QUESTION FOR-- ANNIE C. FROM OHIO-- ANNIE C. FROM OHIO SAID, "WHO DO YOU ALL THINK IS THE BETTER STEW, "HANNAH OR BUGSY?" ANYONE? - I THINK THEY BOTH HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES. - YEAH. - YEAH. - AND EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN STYLE. I'VE WORKED UNDER MANY CHIEF STEWS. I'VE WORKED FOR CHIEF STEWS LIKE BUGSY. I'VE WORKED FOR CHIEF STEWS LIKE HANNAH. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT STYLES. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST EITHER OF THEM. THEY BOTH ARE GREAT AT WHAT THEY DO. THEY JUST HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GOING ABOUT EXECUTING THEIR JOBS. - YEAH, YEAH. - AND BUGSY IS A-A GOOD-- A VERY GOOD STEWARDESS. SHE IS. - KELLY FROM CALIFORNIA SAID, "BUGS, DID YOU ACTUALLY EVER LIKE OR RESPECT HANNAH AT ALL? "DO YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN HER?" - OF COURSE NOT. I DON'T THINK I'M BETTER THAN ANYONE, AND THAT'S MY HONEST TRUTH. - DID YOU EVER LIKE HER OR RESPECT HER? - I DID. - YOU DID? - I DID LIKE HANNAH, YEAH. - PATRICK G. FROM MINNESOTA SAID, UH, "LAUREN, DO YOU THINK YOU TRIED TO PLAY IT BOTH WAYS, SUCKING UP TO BOTH HANNAH AND BUGSY? WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER CHIEF STEW?" - I 100% PLAYED BOTH SIDES BECAUSE I AM A PEOPLE PLEASER. I WANT EVERYONE TO BE HAPPY. I WANT EVERYONE TO WORK AS A TEAM AND GET THINGS DONE, AND IF IT'S TWO PEOPLE ARE TELLING ME CONTRADICTING THINGS, I HAVE TO GO WITH MY SUPERIOR, WHICH IS HANNAH, WHICH ON-- ULTIMATELY TRUMPS WHAT BUGSY SAYS AND DOESN'T MEAN I DISLIKE EITHER ONE OF THEM. IT'S JUST THERE'S A HIERARCHY ONBOARD, AND I RESPECT THE HIERARCHY. - ADAM, MARIA C. FROM FORT LAUDERDALE WANTS TO KNOW WHO YOU'D RATHER WORK WITH IN THE GALLEY, HANNAH OR BUGSY? YOU KINDA HAD YOUR MOMENTS WITH BOTH. - YEAH, YOU KNOW, UM, I THINK THE CHEF IS ALWAYS GONNA BUTT HEADS WITH THE CHIEF STEW, AND, UH, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S BUGSY. - IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S HANNAH. - IS THAT TRUE? - YES. - GENERALLY, YES. - YEAH, ALWAYS. [laughing] - A HUNDRED PERCENT. - I MEAN, YOU GEN-- YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND A COMMON GROUND. IT'S-IT'S REALLY LIKE A BROTHER AND SISTER SCENARIO, IS WHAT IT IS. - UM, LAUREN, ALLIE FROM MICHIGAN WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU DID ANYTHING BUT LAUNDRY ON THE BOAT. - I ACTUALLY DID SO MUCH-- - STIRRED THE POTS A FEW TIMES. - I HONESTLY DID SO MUCH BESIDES LAUNDRY. IT'S MOST OF-- - THAT'S GREAT. - IT'S MOSTLY THINGS THAT I DO ALONE, WHICH DOESN'T REQUIRE A CAMERA 'CAUSE I'M NOT SPEAKING TO ANYONE. SO, I MEAN, I'M SURE EVERYONE HERE WOULD VOUCH THAT I WORKED PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST THIS CHARTER SEASON. - UH, AMBER FROM ATLANTA SAID, "BUGSY, YOU WERE SO CRITICAL OF HANNAH IN ALMOST EVERY EPISODE. "DID YOU NOT SEE THAT BY CONSTANTLY TALKING NEGATIVELY "ABOUT YOUR CHIEF STEW, YOU WERE MAKING YOURSELF "LOOK PETTY, UNPROFESSIONAL, "AND UNWORTHY OF THE JOB? "WHO WOULD WANNA HIRE YOU WITH THAT ATTITUDE?" - WELL, LET'S JUST SAY IT THIS WAY. I NEVER CRITICIZED HANNAH IN THE WORKSPACE ONCE, OKAY? SO, I-I THINK IT WAS MORE INFORMATIVE OF THE WAY THAT I WOULD DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY, NOT NECESSARILY-- - "WHEN I WAS CHIEF STEW." - WELL, WHEN I WAS CHIEF STEW, RIGHT? LIKE, IT WAS JUST INFORMATIVE, UH, ON OUR TWO DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT STYLES. - BUT SHE'S YOUR CHIEF STEW, SO-- - BUT I NEVER DISRESPECTED THAT IN THE WORKSPACE. I DID WHATEVER HANNAH SAID HOW SHE WOULD LIKE ME TO DO IT, AND I DID IT. - DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? - I AGREE THAT SHE DID WHAT I SAID. I THINK THERE WAS A BIT OF ATTITUDE SOMETIMES, BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY NORMAL WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN SUCH A HIGH PRESSURE, HIGH STRESS ENVIRONMENT. THAT CAN OUT NATURALLY. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK I SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, HAD ATTITUDE WITH SANDY WHEN I-- NOT DIRECTLY, BUT WHEN YOU'RE EXHAUSTED, AND YOU'RE STRESSED, AND YOU HAVE THAT MUCH PRESSURE ON YOU, YOU CAN GET FRUSTRATED, AND I DON'T THINK AT ALL THAT IT WAS BUGS' INTENTION TO-TO BE THAT WAY. - WOW. AFTER THE BREAK... I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAYBE A LITTLE MORE HURT THAN YOU'RE LETTING ON. IS THERE STILL A PART OF YOU THAT LOVES HER? ♪♪♪ I WANNA GO BACK I WANNA GO BACK TO SOMETHING, AND I'M NOT TRYING TO PICK A SCAB OR ANYTHING, BUT I JUST HAVE TO GO BACK. [laughing] I'M SORRY, BUT, LIKE, YOUR EYES ARE MISTY. YOU TOLD ME THAT YOUR DAD ALWAYS TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE THE MINUTE YOU MET THEM. YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU TOLD MALIA YOU LOVED HER THE DAY YOU MET HER. - MM-HMM. - I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE-- - NOT THE DAY I MET HER, BUT-- - OKAY, BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAYBE A LITTLE MORE HURT THAN YOU'RE LETTING ON. - YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. I LOOK AT THE TWO OF THEM WALK DOWN THE STREET LAST NIGHT WHEN WE ALL HAD DRINKS, AND THEY WERE KILLIN' IT. THEY LOOK AMAZING TOGETHER, AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO OR SAY THAT'S GONNA CHANGE THAT. SO, AT SOME POINT, YOU JUST GOTTA GROW UP AND WISH 'EM THE BEST OF LUCK. - IS THERE STILL A PART OF YOU THAT LOVES HER? - NO, NO, TIME'S UP. - WHO HERE IS ACTUALLY SINGLE, RIGHT NOW? [laughing] - JUST KIDDING. - EVERYBODY, CAPTAIN SANDY, BUGSY-- BOBBY? - NO, MAX IS NOT. - MAX, ARE YOU NOT WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND? - NO, I'M WITH MY GIRLFRIEND. - YEAH, NO, THEY DIDN'T RAISE. - OH, THEY DIDN'T. - THERE ARE THREE OF THEM. - WOW, WE GOT A LOTTA SINGLE-- - TAKING APPLICATIONS. - UM, CAPTAIN SANDY, I HAVE TO THINK THAT YOUR D.M.s HAVE BEEN LIGHTING UP. - WELL, YEAH, WELL, IT'S PRETTY SCARY, ACTUALLY. SO-- - REALLY? - I LIKE IT TO HAPPEN ORGANICALLY. - YES, YOU DO. - YEAH. - WOW. KATE W. FROM OHIO WANTS TO KNOW, "CAPTAIN SANDY, IF YOU COULD HIRE ONLY ONE OF THE CREW, "TO WORK WITH YOU AGAIN, WHO WOULD IT BE AND WHY?" - WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THIS? I LOVE THEM ALL. - YOU LOVE THEM ALL. - SERIOUSLY. - WES IS HER FAVORITE. - WES. - OH, COME ON. - IT IS WES. - THANK YOU, CAPTAIN SANDY. THANK YOU. - ALL I WANNA SAY TO-TO ALL OF YOU, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. THE OTHER PART OF IT IS, DON'T LIE TO YOUR CAPTAIN. JUST TELL YOUR CAPTAIN THE TRUTH BECAUSE TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK. - WHOO-WHOO. - ALL RIGHT. - HASHTAG. - I LIKE IT. ANYONE HAVE ANY REGRETS FROM THE SEASON? - YES, I DO. I HAVE A FEW. I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE LEFT IT 'TIL WE WERE OFF CHARTER TO PLAY TONSIL HOCKEY WITH JASON, AND, UM, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE CALMED MYSELF AND DEFINITELY GIVEN CAPTAIN SANDY MORE TIME FOR US TO ADJUST TO EACH OTHER THAN I WOULD HAVE TO-TO BE SO QUICK TO-TO JUDGE. - ANY-ANY WITH YOU, BUGS? - YEAH, I THINK I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE COME TO YOU A LOT SOONER, HANNAH, IN THE SEASON WITH MY FRUSTRATION. - HMM. - RATHER THAN THE LAST CHARTER. UM, I NEEDED TO SAY IT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I WASN'T GONNA LEAVE THE BOAT WITHOUT SAYING WHAT I FELT. - I THINK I WOULD HAVE SPENT MORE TIME IN THE BRIDGE, AS WELL. [laughing] - THAT'S RIGHT, MAX. - HAVE A BIT MORE INCENTIVE TO LEARN. - I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE NOT LED EVERYONE ON SO LONG-- MADE MY DECISION SOONER AND MADE IT EASIER ON ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. - WHY DID I KEEP THE SECRET THE ENTIRE TIME? THAT WAS, LIKE, THE DUMBEST THING I COULD HAVE EVER DONE. - WE THOUGHT WE'D PULL IT OFF. [laughing] - YEAH-- IDIOT. - NO REGRETS FROM ME. I'D DO THE SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN. - SERIOUSLY? - BOBBY, ANYTHING? - REALLY? - ME? - YEAH. - I MEAN-- I MEAN, MY ONLY REGRET WOULD PROBABLY NOT TO PEOPLE PLEASE, BUT THAT'S JUST ME, AND THAT'S WHO I AM, AND IF IT MAKES ME LOOK TWO-FACED OR INSECURE, THAT'S FINE. I CAN OWN THAT, BUT I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO BE HAPPY AT THE END OF THE DAY. - UM, YOU KNOW... [sighs] I-I-I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING, BUT I JUST LEARNED A LOT OF WHAT NOT TO DO. UH, AND, UH, I THINK, UM, YOU KNOW, IT'LL ALL PAN OUT ONE OF THE DAYS. SO, WE'LL SEE-- JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS. - THERE YOU GO. - ALL RIGHT, WELL, I WANNA THANK THE CREW OF THE "SIROCCO." THIS WAS GREAT. WHAT AN AMAZING SEASON. [chuckles] IT WAS AWESOME. SEE YOU LATER. ♪♪♪
