He's giving me backtalk, jumping all over the couches, knocking things down behind him. I mean, he's just insane. Mm-hmm. I think that Danny doesn't have any respect for authority or for the chain of command - that needs to be in place - on a yacht, - And he's potentially a hazard - to himself Or to other crew members. - Where is he now? - Do you know?
