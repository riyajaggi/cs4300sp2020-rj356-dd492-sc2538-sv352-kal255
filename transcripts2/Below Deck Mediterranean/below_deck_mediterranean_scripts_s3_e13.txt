She doesn't work. - I think you need to be more clear to other people as to how you feel as well, and not just absorb it. - I will. - Because I just--as an outsider's point of view, like, what she's doing is wrong. Take what I think of her away, what she's still doing is wrong. - Mm-hmm. - Hannah's a manipulator. She's manipulating her friendship towards Brooke as a reason to skive work, and it's not right. I have been trying to prove this point from the start. This is her time to back herself up. Yeah, yeah. - I was on top till, like, 11:00 and I cleaned up a little bit in the crew mess.

Hannah's leaving me with all the decorations, the glassware, the pantry clear up, everything, and it's a bit of a slap in the face, and I'm just sick of it. - Cheerio. - I really need to speak to you. ----ing I'm-- I'm just literally getting more and more frustrated every day. It's got to a point where I feel like I don't actually know what you're doing within the day. And I feel sometimes that you're taking advantage of me.
