What are you gonna do, Jen? - No, are you f... ing - kidding me? - Punch me in the face. - Yeah, I'll save it for this. Do you think I f... ing care? - You don't tell me - to f... myself. Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen, it's not f... ing worth it, okay? You're a bunch of hypocrites. I don't care. If you guys want me off the boat or on the boat, I don't care. Yeah, I f... ing do want you off the f... ing boat. Okay. Fine. F... ing ridiculous. - No, Bobby... - It's not your fault. No. F... that.

No. - All I remember is, everyone - was yelling at me, And I was yelling at everybody else, all because of some f... ing chick. We're just trying to protect you. - You can't bring girls - back to the boat. I'm disgusted at myself. The girls are right, and I regret every minute of it.

I just remember being kind of attacked because I was with a chick. I can't handle somebody I care about, like you, yelling at me, - and calling me these - disgusting names, - And things like that when I'm - trying to help you, you know? I'm sorry, I said things I should never have said, and I did not mean it. And I literally... I felt sick to my stomach, and I was ashamed. I'm really sorry. Do you want a hug? I'm sorry. - There's a lot of people - that would have gone - To the captain last night, - after what had happened, But to me there's an unspoken code in yachting. Protect your crewmates.

I'm disgusted with myself about last night. Yeah. I know I hurt you. - From the bottom of my heart, - I'm so sorry. What you said is just not true. I wasn't jealous one bit. - I wouldn't have cared less - if you'd brought her on or not... I know. I know.
