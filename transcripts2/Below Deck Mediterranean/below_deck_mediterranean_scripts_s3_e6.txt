 they're not marrying up. - [high-pitched mocking] I am not! - I always have a thing-- if I actually like someone, I struggle to be flirty. [crowd cheering] - Are the bosun and the chief stew hooking up? Like, we're not stupid. Something's going on. We're two heads of departments, and I wanna keep the respect of my fellow crew members.

 [crowd cheering] [whistling] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] - What's wrong? Need some time alone? - I know you do. I think you're letting your emotions get the best of you tonight. - I know you're emotional. It's okay. You're all right. If you need to cry, just do it in my shirt. It's polyester... [laughs] - I always have clung onto the idea of finding the one. And I love the idea of love. I'm sure that's hard to hear, but it's just-- I hope you unders-- Thank you, I think you're a ----ing sweetheart as well. Brooke's impossible not to get along with. She's beautiful and she's sweet, but she's just not my type. Let's get up. I'm just holding your wrists. - Why like this? - 'Cause we're friends and all. - Okay. - No? - Yes! - [yawning] Oh yeah. You're a flirt, whether you feel you are. - You know that you are-- the way you act. - You can do that? - Yeah. - Why? - 'Cause you're genuine. Like, you are who you are. That, for me, is marriage material. - Wow. - [indistinct] - Yeah, yeah! #(BLEEP) [blows raspberry] - I like the way Joao is, like, holding my hand, but I want a guy who's going to go for me and be like, I'm not taking no for an answer and I'm-- it's what my dad did with my mom. She said no a million times, and he kept trying and he got her. And they have the best relationship I've ever seen. [motor whirring] - Was that all right? - Yeah, you crushed it, bro. - Give me about two minutes to go and get changed. - [laughs] - You going to bed? Okay, sleep well. [phone clattering] - [laughs] - Who puts a phone there anyway? [both grunting] - I don't do this normally onboard. - Me either. - Showing affection and showing emotion is completely new to me. - [indistinct] (BLEEP) - And you ain't kidding. - I know there's nothing-- I'm not ashamed of any of it at all. It's just completely new. - I'm hurt. [indistinct] for me too, okay? - [whispers] Come here. [tender music] ♪ ♪ All right, see you in the morning. - On leave? - Sweet dreams. - Et toi. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Usually I keep my private life very private, and I've never had a relationship on a boat. Going against every rule I have. I just like to have fun. (BLEEP) it. Ugh. - We did? - We did. - Where? - No idea, (BLEEP). - Everywhere. - Oh, my God. - Did we? - Really? - Oh, my God, I don't want to know. [laughter] I don't wanna know. It's the one thing I don't like doing in front of other people. But I never took the opportunity to tell her how I felt. - We didn't bang in front of them. We just had a kiss. - Thank God. - [laughs] - Oh, my God. [laughter] Ugh. - I know it's gonna make it super awkward with the pair of you. - No, please don't. - [laughs] - It's already super awkward. - Aww, honey. - [laughs] - It's really not. Already been through a break-up, admitted to having chemistry with Joao, and then told the chef that I like him. I just need to relax. - Ooh, I shouldn't hang upside down right now. - It's not doing me any favors. ♪ ♪ - Ooh, Cheerios. That's all you need. No, this girl seriously has an obsession. - Oh no! [whimpers] - You aren't keeping those as well? - Did you hear her cry? [imitates crying] - Where you get those from? - You can do absolutely everything with chocolate milk. Chocolate milk and ice cream, chocolate milk with, like, cookies, chocolate milk, just, chocolate milk. - We'll start calling you leche. [laughter] Leche-lech-lech. - Girls, can you be super careful with the laundry, okay, because there's, like, a bunch of pink stuff and I can't use these now. ♪ ♪ - Adam, Hannah, Conrad. Meet me in the crew nest for a preference sheet meeting. ♪ ♪ - Hi, Sandy. - Hi. This is our next charter-- Derrek and Iliana Milan. Derrek is an executive recruiter for one of the largest executive search firms in the world. The primary reason for this trip is to thank the couples coming along for their friendship, and both Derrek and Iliana are open to trying anything the chef prepares. - Yay. - Yay. - Yay. - This sounds incredible, everything, on paper, but I've got a little post-traumatic stress disorder from the last charter. - This steak is, like, cold, cold, cold. - It is? - Very cold. - I'm just not gonna eat it. - They are still warm. Could this be too good to be true? - "The primary may even bring some fun things from home." So, eight guests, all up. - I'm excited. - Ready to do this? - Yes. - All right. - Thanks, Sandy. - Have you a lot to do? - I have to get this squared away, and I have to do all of that. I don't even know whose sheets these are. People just throw stuff in here. And then Hannah gets mad at me. - If you need me to (BLEEP) anyone up, just let me know. Yeah? - Yes. - Joao, can you stop distracting her? She needs to work. - Okay. - Thank you. - She's working fine. [laughs] - [grunts] - Over again? Got it? - Girls, girls-- Hannah. Can you both meet me in the main salon please? - Copy. - Am I doing it, guys? Daddy? Am I doing it right? - Just gonna sit down and have a chat. So, we pick up charter in a few hours, so we kind of need to get you up to speed, so that I'm not getting woken up in the morning. - All crew, all crew, does anybody know how to make me Bloody Marys? - I need to wake you. - Eh? - Are you feeling quite confident in the coffees and things like that now? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. And how much service have you done? 'Cause it says on your resume, "Silver Service trained." - I never put Silver Service. I just said that I have had service, but I never actually wrote, "Silver Service." - Really? - No. - Yeah. - I'll be back in sec. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Coming up... - Oh my, that man's body. - Keep it in your pants, Jamie. - I'm gonna take it in. I'm gonna take it all in. - And later... - Is that a donkey? - No, it's a bull. - Yeah, they're doing it now. - It says on your resume, - It says on your resume, "Silver Service trained." - I never actually wrote, "Silver Service." - Really? - No. - I'll be back in a sec. - What is she thinking? How did she think that she was gonna get away with that? Like... - [laughs] God, I would hate to be her right now. - So, I just wanna check with you. So, barista training... - Yeah, I have my bartending certificate. - Barista? - Oh, like coffees and stuff like that? Yeah, you put in the pod, and then you click the button-- whatever it may be-- it's a coffee machine. It's not like a authentic, I've been a Starbucks barista-- - Okay, and then "Silver Service"? - I don't remember writing that, I honestly do not. - So you don't think this is your CV that you submitted? - I gave my resume to a friend back home who's in yachting to polish it. I barely looked at it, honestly, and I didn't know that "Silver Service" or "Barista Training" was something so high-end. He made me look like a frickin' superhuman, and I am not... [laughs] - If you say you're Silver Service trained, then I assume that you can do breakfast services. - I understand that, and I'm taking responsibility for it. I'm not trying to bullsh-- my way out of this. - It's just making sense now, and I just feel stupid and lied to, to be honest. - But if I didn't know that it said that-- - It's your CV. What is on your CV is your responsibility. - And I'm taking responsibility for it, - Well, it's a bit late now. - And I'm sorry-- - 'Cause I'm in the middle of a ----ing season with a stewardess who doesn't know how to make a ----ing coffee. [line ringing] - Hi, honey, how are you? - Good, I'm on the bow right now, just hanging out, talking to you... - A tough life you got there, Colin. - [laughs] Yeah, exactly. - How's the food? - It's good. I mean, it's definitely different than what, you know, Nana makes, you know. - Yeah, yeah. - And to be honest, I kinda like the New York pizza better than Italy's. - Oh, really? - Yeah. I'm definitely missing my parents. I'll admit--I'm a little bit of a mama's boy. I'm only child, what do you expect? My mom cries a lot when I don't invite her over. I'm like, Mom, we both live on Long Island, we both live in the same small town, and I'm only a couple blocks away from you. Come on over whenever the hell you want. Tell Dad I said hello. - I will, love you. - All right, I love you too. Bye bye. - Bye. - Hey. - Hello. So... - Let's sit. - Thanks. [laughs] - I just hate a dirty boat. - No, I understand. So, things haven't really been making sense with Kasey from the start. I've just worked out her entire CV's a lie. - (BLEEP) - When I asked her about her barista training, she said, "Oh, you open the thing, and you put the pod in, and you press the button." She doesn't know what Silver Service is. - [scoffs] - Lying on your CV is 100% a fireable offense. - This is hard. As a captain, all the crew reflect me, at the end of the day, in the owner's eyes. But, I mean, we have a charter boarding today. So why don't we get through this charter... - Yeah, okay. - With her. And then... - We'll go from there. - Yes. - Okay. - I'm pissed that Kasey lied on her resume. But at the same time, a third stew is an entry-level position. We're about to start our fourth charter. Hannah should've taken the time to train her properly by now. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Just found out my third stew's been lying to me the whole time, and her CV is full of sh--. She doesn't know what Silver Service is. It's your CV, bitch, this has your ----ing name on it. And now, I'm ----ing done. - Oh, is it? - You didn't... - No, what? - Oh, no. - All crew, all crew, please be in your uniforms. - Copy, copy. ♪ ♪ - That's it, squeeze it right in. Squeeze it through. Oh, yeah. - [laughs] - All crew, all crew, to the dock. - Stupefying. It's cool. - I know, wow, this is incredible. - Are you a ninja? You scared me. - [laughs] - I didn't even hear you. - Hi. - Hi, welcome. I'm your captain, Sandy. - Hi, I'm Derrek. Very nice to meet you, Sandy. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, Hannah. - Hannah, Derrek. Nice to meet you. - Iliana, nice to meet you. - Colin? - Yeah, how are you? - Pleasure. - Nice to meet you. - We're very happy to have you. - We're happy to be here. - We're gonna have you board. Hannah will show you around the boat, and my crew will get the luggage on board. - Okay, great, thank you. - Awesome, thank you. - Mind just hopping your shoes off just there for me? - Whoa, a little bounce to it. - This is the bridge deck aft. We'll be doing most of your meals there. - Sounds good. Who knew? - Oh yeah, perfect. - Now this is gorgeous. You could have a full-blown party up here. - Fantastic. - Okay. - First impressions? - Really nice. What do you think? - Genuine eyes. Genuine smiles. - Yeah. I'm so embarrassed. Now being around Adam and he knows I've got a crush on him-- I wish I could avoid him, but on a boat, you just can't. - Tan legs, I mean, they spend a lot of time at the beach. - [chuckles] - 'Cause they can't possibly be upset with life. - This is the upper salon. - Beautiful. - Let's go to the worst room and see who's gonna sleep there. - There are no worst rooms. - Down, down we go. - This is the master. - Beautiful. - You can get lost. - I'm already lost. - So we've got the two double rooms in here. - Beautiful. - Charter number four. We're ready to go. All good in the neighborhood. - Copy. I'll start releasing. Can I have these two springs? Hey, interior, interior, can I have you guys on fenders just as we're leaving. - Copy that. - That's all lines on board. You are all clear. - Look at you, out on deck. - Meter and a half on starboard. That's your stern in line with the boat on starboard side. - One, two, three. Smile, yucky. - Captain Sandy, you are all clear to swing. - I'm taking over in the bridge. - Okay, let's bring all fenders onboard. [grunts] - This is phenomenal. - Now, this is a jump, dude. - Can we do that? - Oh, easy. God, it's windy out here, though. I'm going down. - Deck crew, secure everything. We've got some wind. If we prevent an accident from happening-- it's easy, it's a checklist. Conrad doesn't have a checklist. I can only imagine if I ask him where his checklist is before we leave, we're gonna have another issue. So, let him (BLEEP) up. - Uh-oh... - Is he drunk already? - Deck crew, we might want to drain the Jacuzzi a little bit. It's slurping around. - Yeah, copy. Jamie, Jamie, cover it. And make sure you shut off the Jacuzzi, and then, uh, drain the valve, please. - Coming up... - Oh, my gosh, please don't do that. This guest is clearing the plates. - So you say, "No, stop." That's your job. - Sorry. - I'm sick of excuses. [kitchenware rattling] - Jamie, make sure you shut off the Jacuzzi, and drain the valve. - Copy. - Ugh, just gonna check the decks. - You could feel the boat being blown. - All covers or just this? - Just the main. - Sandy said to get changed, so... - Yeah, all gonna get changed. [water trickling] [mellow music] - Hey, boo. - So, let's do a mixed green salad, balsamic vinaigrette. We're gonna have garlic lemon chicken. Too much? - I think so. Like, two salads... - I'm just so, like, wound up from the last trip. - I know. ♪ ♪ - I have a headache. This is really bad. - If you're gonna throw up, this is when you're gonna throw up. - I'm okay for now. I took the seasickness pill at, like, 11:00. - Good. - Excusez-moi, capitano? - Si? - We can't do lunch on the bridge deck aft while we're under way... - 'Cause the wind's gonna blow their food off their plate. - Yeah. - We have blinds if you need. - Can you put them up while we're under way? - Yeah, I can, no problem. - Oh, yeah, great, let's do that. Joao is gonna make a great leader. He has initiative, works hard. He thinks about, "How can I help?" That really means a lot. - Adam, Adam, Hannah, all guests are seated. - There's the rock caves. - Hannah, I'm plating protein right now. - Copy that, on our way. - You can roll with those. - Mm-hmm. - Mmm, oh-ho-ho-ho. - Wow. - Exactly. - So this is garlic chicken breast. And we have poached lobster tails, herb potato salad, and mixed green salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, look at that heap of potato salad, that's amazing. - Hey, guys. - Bravo. - We love it. It's amazing. - I just wanted to see about dinner real quick. - You do what you wanna do, and we'll... - Do you. - Thank you so much. Enjoy. - Well done, Adam. - Wow. - Whew! - Deck crew, now that the swells have calmed down, we can drop anchor here. - Copy. - Drop it.

[mellow music] - How beautiful is this place? - Yeah, it's nice. - Mind-blowing. - It's the third one over there. - This is funny. - What is that? Is that a donkey? - No, it's a bull. - Yeah, they're doing it now. She's just come to help me with this. - If you need to set the toys up, you can do that and then I go go through this with you later. - Okay. - Sure. - Yes, ma'am. No worries. - He's got his nose up Hannah's butt. [inflator whirring] - It's different. [laughter] - Own the bull. Own the bull. Take the bull by the horns. - Look at him. - Take the bull by the horns. - The neck is wrong. - He's riding a bull. - He is riding a bull. - What are you doing? [plates rattling] - What the (BLEEP) is going on over here? Oh okay, I was like, I was just making sure there weren't plates, like, flying. How you doing? - I'm okay, how are you? - Hannah's not being too hard on you, is she? - It's Hannah. - I keep saying you're a New Yorker, you got it. Tough skin. Kasey lying on her resume does not change the way I feel about her. I can still see a willingness to learn. I mean, I lied on my first resume. You fake it till you make it. That's all she was trying to do. - Deck crew, deck crew, Hannah. Just be aware we've got guests that are jumping off the top. - Ugh, oh, my God. - Oh hey, babe! Feet first, baby. Feet first. - [laughs] - Whoo! [laughter] - Oh my, that man's body. - Keep it in your pants, Jamie.

Make us whatever you want." Man, that lights a fire under my ass. ♪ ♪ - Truthfully, I've worked on yachts before. Yeah, they might've been day charters, but I thought that I would've had enough experience for an entry-level position on a super-yacht. I mean, it's not brain surgery. I got a degree in psychology. Can't be harder than that. - Hey. - Hi. - Okay, so let's do cabins now. - God, this is so amazing. - The cushions need to be straightened up. There's rubbish in this bin in here. There's, like, water marks everywhere. - I went over it with the microfiber and the alcohol. - So why does it look like that, then? This is yachting and we have such a high standard, and she's not really cutting it. Are you taking the cabin checklist with you? - I don't need it. I remember everything. - Well, you obviously-- you need it, Kasey. - I'm doing it, and I'm doing it fine, so-- - Well, you're not doing it fine. You were hired under false pretense, and that--I have to either live with, or fire you. - Okay. - (BLEEP) me. - Is it not the most comfortable thing you've ever worn? - Sweat-xedo. - Beautiful. - These guests are restoring faith in humanity.

[excited chatter] - Shake and bake, baby, shake and bake. - Adam, Hannah. The guests are finished. Let me know when you want me to clear. - Yeah, please take your time and do a glass of wine or something. - Oh, that's helpful, John. - Oh, my gosh, please don't do that. - No, this is what I do at home. This is, like, my job. - Hannah, he does laundry too. He's good. - He does laundry? Oh. - He wants to get hired. - He's helping me clear... [laughs] Thank you. - I'll clear these. - You honestly don't-- no, you won't. - Yes, this is what I do at home. - No, but you're not at home. You're on holiday. - I swear to God. - You need to enjoy yourself. - I'm doing this. - One of the guests is helping Hannah clear up. - Why? - God knows. - [groans] Damn it. - Adam, Hannah. All dishes are cleared. - I need the time of plate clearing to plate their next course. Okay, I'm gonna need your assistance, please. Can you wash your hands? Hannah has done nothing here to prevent the guests from ----ing me up in the back of the house right now. - That was actually quite funny. One of the guests started clearing with me. I was like, no, I'm trying to clear slowly. You're ruining [indistinct]! - That's ----ing annoying. - Coming up... - The slide won't untwist itself if it's blown up like that.

It has mussels, clams, prawns, a local fish, and then spaghetti. - Delicious. - Enjoy. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - This is so good. - I can relate to what Kasey's done because I've been there-- I've done it. Opportunities are small in Zimbabwe, and I've taken any opportunity, whether I could do it or not, but there are repercussions. And if you fake it to make it, and you can't make it, and people see that in you, you're ----ed...

I should've checked. - But it did get you here, so it's not... - Yeah, but it also might get me outta here. - Kind of. The biggest thing about yachting is the deception of people only one step above you that feel that they have so much power, and yet, they don't. If the Captain's happy with your work, you're gonna stay. I'll try and back you up as best as I can. - Thanks. - All right, we can start pulling the anchor up. - Copy.
