 - Previously on Mediterranean"... - The Med is the playground for the rich. - Holy hell. - How's it going? You're the chief stew? - I am. - Off top. - I can shake my booty with the best of them. - They're all cute. It's that brunette and blue eye combination. - Oh, yeah. - Dude, that's a hard find. - I'd like to offer you the chief mate's

 position on the boat. - Fantastic. - Do you enjoy the deck work more? - Oh, absolutely. I have a degree in marine biology. Like, I don't want to clean up toilets for a living. I need my vitamin D. - Well, now you're inside. What the fááá is Tiffany doing here? - Our primary is Christine Bullock, a health-conscious person that just launched a skincare line. - That girl is fine. - Eggplant and grease. I don't want any of that. - What's happening? They don't like it or what? - They said it's very heavy. - Fááá. - Dude, where you been, girl?

 Supposed to be on deck at 6:00. You up on deck at 6:00? - Jen is the first female I've ever worked with on the exterior. so this is gonna be a challenge for me. - No. It was one of our non-negotiables, was to have it on. - Our tip's at risk. I can't go back to the boat and tell them there's no game. I'm hoping you can help me. There's a football match my guests want to watch tonight. I'm looking for a football game. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. It's an American football game. - Hey. - How was your lunch? - It was delicious. Thank you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Oh, good, good, good. - Bob is so grumpy though. He's really upset about the Steelers game. - I'm starting to feel really anxious because it just doesn't seem like this game is gonna happen. I've definitely had better charters, and for the first one of the season, I probably would have liked it to be going a bit more smoothly. - No, they've won two on the line. - I know, but they haven't been to six, have they? - No. They've won six. What's up? - How you doing? - Finished our beautiful lunch here. It was excellent. - So it's a super-small town. It's basically just one café with a TV with the local channels. - Sháá. I've never missed a Steeler game, period. - You've never missed a single Steelers game? - Never missed a single Steelers game. - My only hope now is that the captain, by some miracle, gets the game working on the boat. So we've got the boat ready. Come with me. - Come on, guys. - Fááá. - Thank you. - So I was thinking that hooking the computer up to this TV, we can stream it over the Internet. - Makes sense to me. - When a guest has a non-negotiable request, we have to do everything within our power to make that work, and if we don't do it, we are essentially failing in our jobs. - We got a red flag here. - Oh, it means no Internet connection. áááá. Lost the Internet. We've got the connection now from a computer to the receiver to the TV. I don't understand why it can't get online. - I'm back in the dungeon. Dan, towels for you guys. - For outside? - Yeah. - Don't they have to be dots? Or no? - I don't know what you guys mean by dots and waves. I've been a gypsy for five years. I was dredging and then I started yachting. I don't even have an apartment. I move around a lot. I thrive off change, and this is so monotonous. So what is this? - A fat wave. - Oh, it's a crew towel anyway. - Yeah. - So not that. I know I just need to buckle down, learn my interior, then get my captain's license right after this. - I don't understand why it can't get online. - So we can't get online? - I haven't been able to get online from day one. I can't even watch boobies on my phone, and you're trying to stream a football game in the middle of the Med, come on. - We're gonna have to go into our Internet connection and choose a different one. - Let's give it a shot. Let me try Princess. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - That's it. - Oh, yeah. - Boom. That's done. - Now we've got it. It's just super-slow. - I'm sure it'll be fine. - Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. - What are you making? - I am making red scorpionfish. It's got almost like a lobster texture. - That sounds amazing already. - Yeah, yeah. It's pretty awesome. Last night's dinner was probably a little heavy. I'm gonna go the opposite direction with some fresh-caught scorpionfish and a little prosciutto bacon to placate the guys. Please, God. Let's hope they enjoy it. All right. - Ever since you put my hat on, it stinks. - Shut up. - Yeah. - Yeah, but smell my head. Does that stink? - Ugh. - You're not nice. - Welcome back. How was lunch? - It was great. - For you, not for me. So stupid. - Mmm. How's it going? - Ugh. - What did you find? What are you doing? - I'm just gonna give the captain a bit of an update. There's not one bar or pub that's gonna show the game at 3:00 a.m., anyway. - Uh-oh. - Hello. - So I have great news for you. - Really? - We've got the streaming thing working. We've got the game. - Yes. - We've got it on the big screen. - Thank God for the Internet. Oh, my God. I just feel like, phew. - Yeah, a load off. - Okay. Sweet. Thank you. Very good news. - Really? - It's gonna stream here. - Really? - Yes. - That's really good. - So, what I was thinking is because they're gonna be up till at least 6:00, you need to get up at 4:00 and do the morning stuff. Do you know what I mean? - Yeah, it shouldn't be a problem at all. - Yeah. - My family's from Pittsburgh. I grew up with my dad and my brother, so I'm a huge Steelers fan, and love screaming at the TV. I'm like that assáááá in the bar that's standing up on it like, "Come on, áááá!" I don't mind. Game's on. Yay. - Yeah. Perfect. Done. - Jen. Jen. Where you at? - Yeah. Where you want me to meet you? - I don't you to meet me anywhere. I just want you on deck. - Fááá. Uh, Bryan, I'm changing my tampon. Thank you. Hey, I went to pee, and I didn't feel it was appropriate to tell you over the radio. - No problem. You can just say, "Look, I'm in the bathroom." - That's the thing, I don't want everyone to hear, like, the captain, "Oh, I'm in the bathroom," like I don't know. - Yeah, that's fine. Just say, "Look, I'm using the restroom." - You want me to tell you when I'm going to the bathroom? - Yeah. When we're out on deck, you're on my time. You can't just disappear and then be upset with me 'cause I'm trying to find you. I'm your boss. Have some respect. I know you know better, so just do it, and that's it. - The filet mignon of fish. - When we were in Bora Bora, I was able to watch the game. Florence, we were able to watch the game. - Is the backdrop not amazing? Do you know what would just make these nights so much better? - A cocktail. - A cocktail and the game being shown on board. - No way! You're kidding. Are you F-ing with me? - I'm not fáááing with you. - You move mountains. - Exactly. Well, that's our job. - Love it! - I'm gonna let Jen off around 10:30. - Cool. - And then it's gonna be you and me for the remainder of the night. - Bryan and I get along great because he reminds me of the guys at the firehouse. I'm coming onto this not knowing anything, so I am just a sponge ready to learn everything I can. - You know, the game only starts at 3:00? It starts at 3:30, and I'm gonna get up and watch the end of it. Well, not--I mean, work. - Yeah, nice. - Yeah. - You're the guy who has to stay out until they're done. You cool with that? - Let's do it. - So we're doing two little forks. - Yeah. - One big fork. Fish, knife, knife. - Take this off. So one small one in there. Yeah, that looks nice. All right? - I like them to, like, see it how I'm seeing it. - So you want the point left-hand corner? - Point at the top, yeah. - For starters, we have a Greek salad with a homemade dressing. Bon appétit. Enjoy. - Cheers. Everybody, thanks for coming to Greece. The Greek salad's so nice. - Let's do this. - You look very sharp in your uniform. - Thank you. You ladies look lovely too. - Guys, guys, guys, guys. Go in the other room, please. - How's it going? - It's going well. How's your day been? - Nothing horrible's gone wrong. Were you ever able to find any kind of stationary to print menus on? - Do you usually do menus, Ben? - I'm trying to have clear thoughts and if there's a lot of banter in the background, it fááá you up. I don't want this to turn into a social place, all right? So just, if someone comes in, don't ask them high-mileage questions, like how was their day, you know? All right, um-- - Are we good to go? - Local red scorpionfish, couscous and lemon vinaigrette. Just be careful with them too. - You can play football. You know the defense is gonna be aiming to hurt him, and he's gonna cry like a little baby. - Oh, wow, look at this. - That looks like prosciutto bacon. - So, Hannah, what is all this? - This is a very rare fish. It's a red scorpion, lemon vinaigrette, and prosciutto. - Oh, wow. - Mmm. - If Ben were a chick, I'd make out with him right now. - They're all having orgasms at the table. - Do they like it? Thank you. - Is it really almost midnight? - It's almost midnight. I'm ready for football. - I will not be watching the game with these guys tonight. - Night-night, daddy. - Good night. - We're good? - We're good. - Yeah, there you go. - Thank you. - Good night. You're welcome. See you at 6:00 a.m. - Yeah, 6:00 a.m., on deck. - Good night. - Mmm. That is so good. Mmm. - Daniel-san. - Yeah. - What are you still doing up? - I'm going to bed now. - Does anyone have a really squishy pillow and want a fluffy pillow? - Yeah, I like fluffy. - Okay, I'll swap you. - You want to swap? - Yes. Oh, my God. That looks amazing. Thank you. - Is that better? - Much better. And it smells like you. - Bobby! - Was it a rough day? - No, no. It was rough on Hannah. But, you know, she's got me. Backup. - 5'4" backup. - Bobby cracks me up. When he first got on the boat, I was thinking, "Oh, gosh. This guy loves himself. He's gonna talk about himself all the time." But he's so goofy. He just lights up the room, and I love that about him. You taking it easy tomorrow night if we have the night off? What kind of drinker are you? You a lightweight? Can you drink a lot? - I'm a lightweight, but I can maintain. - Okay. - A couple drinks and I'll get a solid buzz, and still maintain. - Okay. Do you know what you're saying? In the U.K., when a guy says he can maintain, it's about maintaining the downstairs. - Yes. - Okay. - And I'm telling you, I can maintain. You're gonna see it. - Okay. - Let's get this started. - I just brought you some pretzels. - Thanks for staying up with us. - My pleasure. Let's get this game going for you. - There was no chance I was gonna miss this. - I'm so happy that we managed to get the game working on the boat, because seven-star service is really taking it to the next level. It needs to be so much better than anything that they've ever experienced. - "The game will start soon." - Oh, there we go. There we go. - Boy. - Oh, my God. - You want some coffee? - People are like, "Why do you love, like, watching your team so much?" People don't understand. When you grew up with your family, it's a bonding thing. - You'll, like, stay up that late for a football game? - Don't you roll yours eyes at football. - Oh, sááá. - I mean, my brothers, my dad, my grandpa, that's all we talk about. - Okay, gentlemen. I'll leave you to it for a minute. I'll be right back. - Oh. - I'm not hearing anything. - Oh, come on. It should play. - I'm exhausted and I want to go to bed, and if this fáááing game does not start working soon, I am going to smash something. - áááá. - Stopped again. - Come on, come on, come on, come on. - I can't believe it. - How do we make this thing work? - Come on. - We're--we're-- It's buffering. - Unreal. - Coming up... - Tiffany, could you get onto that list? - I'm on it. - So then let's go. You've done fáááing nothing. - Fááá. Stopped again. - Come on, come on, come on, come on. - Come on. - No, they kicked off. - Unreal. - It's giving us little snippets, and then it goes back to freeze-frame. It's very frustrating. You do everything you possibly can, and one little thing doesn't come to fruition. That certainly can affect their satisfaction of the whole trip. - Oh, fááá. Oh, fááá. - Oh, fááá. - Hey. - Is it working? - It's buffering. - Oh, fááá. - I'll just quickly run through that list with you. Like, obviously, you're gonna organize the drinks. Like, two tonic, two soda. Wipe down the main saloon and the hallway and the staircase and have breakfast set by 8:30. And just have the hair behind your face just with the guests. - Oh, good morning to you, too. - I actually might go to bed. I really hope your game comes on. Tiffany will be around if you need anything, okay? - Fááá. It's so frustrating. - I'm off to bed. - I couldn't sleep again. - Yeah. Oh, my God... - Oh, there we go. We got audio. - You got to be kidding me. Two field goals missed already? - Ah, sááá. Ahh! Jeez, come on, dude. You can do it! Oh, I mean, come on. Oh, Christ. Ahh! - You sounded sad. - So far, the audio's bad luck. - If it makes feel better, I'm representing. - Oh, nice. We have to win. I mean, come on. - This guy must be so pissed. He can't watch the game, and his team is playing like sááá. I'll just get him really drunk so he's not too upset about it. - Every missed field goal, double it. - How we doing? - Fááá my phone. - Well, a good luck drink, hopefully. - Ah, right. Oh, sááá. It's coming on. Oh! Oh! It's a touchdown! You're good luck. You got to stay. You stay through the rest of the game. The sun just came up. We're sitting down watching games. Whoo! We lost this game. - Good morning. - Yeah. - Oh, my God, he finally got the game streaming. Like, he couldn't watch the whole first half. He only had audio. He's had, like, 18 of these gin drinks. I don't know how he's still awake. - 18? - And I'm not pouring them light. - What the hell is that? - That's green juice. You want some? - Well, what's in it? - Spinach, lettuce, apple, lemon, ginger. - I'm over it. - No? You're over it? God, you scare easily. - Yo. - I've been in such a destructive mode. I've been thinking about just stealing that boat. - And where would you go? - I didn't get that far in my thought process. - Daniel, Daniel. - You either go all the way out into the ocean where you'll run out of gasoline and die. - Daniel, Daniel. - I'd port over here in that city and you'd never find me. - But I'd find the tender and have it back. We'll be like, "Fááá our guest. We don't need him." - Nah. - Daniel. - Yes. - I hate it interrupt. Can I talk to you real quickly? - Yeah, yeah. Sure thing. Hey, I'll catch you later man. - It's clear to see that Daniel hasn't worked on a high-end yacht like this before. We're here to make sure the boat's clean, their drinks are full, and if they want to go swimming, we're there to help them. Not here to have a conversation. A couple of things. - Yeah. - First off, your radio's out. - Sorry, man. - No problem. Here, let me fix it. See this tube? You see how it's kind of bent out? You can twist this in a little bit and that's gonna, like, conform to your ear. - Okay. Cool. - There you go. And I know we want to talk with the guests, and that's fine. - Yeah, yeah. - But casually, you know, drinking a soda and shooting the sááá with them, we just don't-- we kind of want to avoid that. - Five star service, to me, is going above and beyond for the guests. I mean, if I made that connection, then maybe he'll say, "Here's some cash, baby. Here's some cash for your ass." - Why don't you go down and take a little break. Finish your drink and come back up. - Okay. Sounds good. - See you up in a bit. - Hey, guys. - Hello. - How's it going? - Good. - So I was thinking about doing an omelet today. - I'm gonna go paddleboard. - I thought breakfast would be good at 9:00 anyway. - Perfect. - All right. Sweet. - Cheers, guys. - Tiffany, have you done what needs doing downstairs, yeah? - Um... - Go through the list. Check. - Oh, no, I haven't done that. A secret of being a stew is you've got to multitask. You know, you're getting a drink for someone. At the same time, you've got to be fluffing a pillow. You've got to always be doing something. - How are you? - We played well enough to lose, so it's okay. - I bet Tiffany watched some of the game with you. - Yeah, she did. I don't know. She's a Steelers fan, too. - Yeah. Well, good. I am so sick of me and Julia working our butts off and running around and for her to just watch a football match? I don't think so. Tiffany, how much have you done from that list? - I struggled a little bit with getting breakfast ready. The juice took me the longest. - I'm just trying to gauge how it took you four and a half hours to do that. - I'm not here to intentionally make her look bad. I'm giving her 110%, and whether she believes it or not, that's the truth. Like, I'm doing everything I can. - I know, baby. - Here, come close. Here, I've got you. - Thank you guys. - Sure, of course. - It was amazing. - All right, guys, let's go chill out and eat breakfast. - Sounds good. - Ohh. - Hell yeah. Ben has done it again. - Well, it's the most exciting time for the day. - I know! Did you figure out what that is? - I don't care. - Everyone here is so excited to be in Greece, and I cannot stand this place. I hate how old the buildings are. I hate the food. I miss my dog. I miss Starbucks. - Deck crew, deck crew. Hannah. If any of you guys have a minute, there's, like, a cardboard box on the aft deck. - Definitely. Hey, I'll come and take care of it. Are you good to go? - What are we moving? - A box that's on the main aft deck. That's gonna go fore to the Jacuzzi. - To the Jacuzzi? - To the Jacuzzi. - Okay, okay. - Just bung 'em up there. - When I was younger, my father was an alcoholic, and he couldn't really work that much. So I had to go ahead and help pay the bills, help put food on the table, help out the family. So now my first reaction is to help out. This. You carry one. Carry two. And I'll be right behind you. - Come on, Weasel. - All right. We're ready with this. - It's a Greek omelet. - Greek omelet? - Definitely got some truffle oil. - Mmm. - Tiffany? - Yeah? - Could you get onto that list, please? I'm happy to do service. - I'm on it. - So then, let's go. - I am. - Ugh. - Well, you're not, 'cause you're standing here staring at this. - I'm trying to read the date on it. - Why do you need to know the date? Fáááing go. Go right now. Do your job. - Just chill. I think Hannah might be jumping the gun to get this pissed off with Tiffany this early. She's a third stew. She's not meant to be an amazing genius at her job yet. - Go, do the cabins with Julia. - I'm sorry. - Then she's out of my fáááing face for some amount of time. - Coming up... - You've been dealing with her for three days straight. - No, I haven't. - Okay. Exactly. - Your department is the deck. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, back it up. - Julia, Julia. Hannah. - Go ahead, Hannah. - I've just sent Tiffany down to do the cabins with you, and I'll take care of the guests upstairs. - Got you. That's perfect. Thank you. Tiffany, are you okay? - I can't fáááing please her. - Oh, that's all right. Don't. Come on. You don't need to cry. Come on, pull it together. Third day, come on. No one likes to see anyone cry, do they? Come on, sweetheart. Breathe, breathe. I've been in the position Tiff is in with another chief stew, and if you don't know how you're going wrong, it's difficult to fix it. Are you all right, sweetheart? - Yeah. - Look, you can have a nice drink tonight. - So how bad was the connection last night? - I heard that all we had was the audio. I guess it, like, was breaking up, and, I mean, he was obviously pissed. - We got the second half. Audio only. We lost by 7. - I'm just hoping it's not gonna-- - I know. - You know, it's just-- - You know, we did everything we could. - Yeah, we'll see what happens. - Go on. - Could you start running stuff down for me? - Yeah, point service. Oh, she was crying. Oh! - I don't want her to fail. I want her to succeed. I want us to be happy and I want us to have a nice season. But I just don't allow myself to lower standards because it is the small things that make yachting yachting. She had a really hard time watching the game with the guests this morning. - We'll have a-- Well, yeah. - I don't have time to fáááing babysit her. - I know, I know, baby, but you've got a whole charter season to figure it out. - We'll go over with them docking. Anything you want to mention? - We were asked to move into the berth a little bit further this time. - Okay. - We have been asked by the port authority to move in a little bit 'cause there is a boat that's closer to our bow than when we departed, and if there's a current coming from the stern of the boat, the wind dies down, then it's gonna push us off the dock. So you really have to be focused on what you're doing to make it happen right every time. Whatever one of the springs is aft-20, is the one we need on there to keep us from going into that fishing trawler. - That's gonna be your line, okay? - You on the bow? That's gonna mean you looking over the bow saying, "Okay, Captain. Got 20 feet. You got 15." You know, that kind of a thing. - Okay. - 'Cause it's gonna be tight. We're gonna snug it right in there. - Okay. It's extremely important to follow directions when docking, because we're throwing this 500-ton vessel up against a cement wall, and if everything isn't in the right place at the right time, we could smash the boat. - A lot of variables in a tight spot. - And you understand the fuel line's very important, right? The aft running line? 'Cause it's stopping us, if we have to, to crashing into another boat. So maybe one wrap, two wraps, and pail it out. Okay, when we say tie off, lock it down. Cool? - Okay. - Are you gonna be confident on that line? - I'm comfortable tying this entire boat up myself. - Pumped? - Mm-hmm. - Excited for the challenge? You good? - Always, man. - Okay. - You don't even got to ask. - Yeah. All right, my brother. All right. - Primary starts up. Hauling anchor chain whenever you're ready. - Okay. Copy that. - You think we're taking off? - They're about to start main engines then go. - Anchor's in the anchor pocket. - Copy that. Thank you. Here we go. Heading for the pier. Bryan, do you see any approaching traffic from our stern? - We're all good, Captain. - Thank you. - Once you finally only got the audio working, you were like, make this, like-- - It's freeze. - Well, it would make this announcement and freeze. - Making the final approach to come in. We've got all-new people that have never done this before. I have no idea what their capabilities are. We've got charter guests on board. This has to be perfect the first time. It's even closer. We're gonna be real tight on this bow. - Copy that. - Okay, Bobby, what's our distance off up there now? - I'd say about 40 feet and closing. Being a firefighter, I'm used to high-pressure situations, but I've never done this before. It's nerve-racking. - Get us within 20. - We're coming up on this boat. Coming up on the dock. We don't have brakes, and I'm just hoping that everything goes the way it's supposed to go. - Another 25 feet to go forward. Jen, get ready to go. - It's gonna go this way. - How's our stern looking now, Bryan? - Ten feet to go. - Inching forward. - Let's go. Who's catching our lines? Give it to him. - That way. - Jen, stay on those lines and keep 'em tight. - Actually, to come forward, we're gonna need to slack Jen's number two. - Copy that. - Okay, Bob. What's our distance now? - Looking about ten feet. - Okay, Bryan, that's about as close as we can safely get. How are you looking? - We're looking flush with the dock back here. Wrap 'em up, guys. - Copy that. - He's good. He drive this boat very well. - I've seen a lot of boats coming in to dock, and this guy, he knows how to handle it. He's a pretty fáááing good captain, actually. - Bowline lock off. - We are secure on the stern. - Okay. Gentlemen and lady, good job. Guests departing in 20 minutes. Make sure you're in your whites, please. - I think they're gonna have to load me up with some of that champagne to get me off the boat. - Yeah, and I was a wreck over the Steelers game, but I loved this trip. It was the best trip we've ever had. - Pretty perfect. Made use of almost all of my bikinis. - Did you clock out? - Yeah, I'm out of my dungeon. - I think Hannah... She seems like she's a monster, though. - Yeah. - I'm pretty good at reading people. - I think I bond with Jen really well because we both love being outside. We're not girly. We're both kind of bros. - Excuse me, these are not mine. - Oh, sorry. I've been doing so much laundry. I think that's-- those are Hannah's. - Imagine walking around in these. I don't want to be caught holding these. - Are you sad to be leaving us? - I'm very sad. - Yeah? - I'm clinically depressed. - Oh. - I took an objective test, and I was clinically depressed. - Really? - Yeah. - I can't believe the Internet was fast enough for that. I'm hoping that we can have a good joke about it and it won't seem like such a disaster. It's been a pleasure having you on board, so... - Lots of food and lots of alcohol. I'm actually ready to-- feels good. - Have a little break? - Yeah. - Good idea. - All crew, all crew. Guests departing main deck, aft. - All right, guys. - Thank you. - Nice meeting you. - So glad to meet you, too. - Yeah. - Thanks so much. - My pleasure. Pleasure meeting you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I don't even know who won the game. - Okay. - Really? Do you want to rub some salt on the wound there, honey? Stick with driving the boat. - We want to thank you. You know, Captain, just taking us to the most gorgeous places, the delicious food, the wonderful service. You know, there were a couple hiccups, I think. - Coming up... - Are you really drinking out of a bottle? - This is my glass. Oh, my God. - I'm embarrassed to be seen with her. - Mom... - Trash bag daughter. - Ohh! - There were a couple hiccups, I think. - We really appreciate the effort. Really trying to get that game on, but that was a non-negotiable for her husband, and he was a little upset to say the least. - Oh, fááá. - We do have one more request before we go though. - Uh-oh. - Bobby needs to drop and give us 20 push-ups. - Dude, you're all over it. Hurry up. - Go. - Go. - One, two, three. - I'll pretty much do whatever you say for that envelope. - Yeah! - Thank you guys so much. Appreciate it. - Thank you so much. That's awfully sweet of you. - Good luck with everything. - Thank you. - Too easy. Good job, bro. - I'm just glad it wasn't me. - All crew, all crew. Tip meeting in five minutes. - What's up? - Hello. - Hello. - Hey, girl. - This charter tip could go any way. I don't know how the other departments handled it. I know there's room for improvement in my department. So, you know, we could get anything. - So here we are. For our first charter, you guys did quite well, considering the challenges that we had. In terms of total gratuity, that comes out to 15,000 Euros. - Wow. - For three days, that's not too bad. - That's great. - Not at all, yeah. - Whoo. - Comes out to $1,388. - I'm so relieved. I do whatever it takes to get that tip. - Yeah. That's how I like it. - Drop and give me 20. - Except 20 pushups. I'm not fáááing doing 20 pushups. Thank you. - Thank you. - There you go. - Yeah, baby. - I don't make that in two weeks at the fire department, so I'm testing the waters of the yachting industry, and right now, the waters are nice. - Aww. - You did. - You know, it's my third or fourth time. - He's a quick learner. - We will be working the rest of the day. We got to get this boat turned around, but you guys have really earned a night off and have some fun. But alcohol. Alcohol policy on the boat. The boat is certainly not a place to get drunk. We don't sit around here and party on the boat and make a big splash out of it. So let's just keep it cool. You know, we try to preserve the boat for the guests and owner's use. Okay? - Okay. - Great. - I'm excited for the night out. - Yeah. - So you've got a boyfriend? - Yeah. I've been with him for two years. - All right. Is he in yachting? - He's in banking, so yeah. My boyfriend's called Matthew. We've been together for two years, and he's gorgeous. He's got a big beard. He's got muscles like bloody Popeye. He's a really sweet guy. I've had boyfriends and this one's a keeper. - Yeah? - Yeah. I used to go for a few boyfriends in the past a bit crazy in the head, and I realized it just is too much of a roller coaster. So I've got my Stable Mabel. You? - No. I'm more of a go out, meet a guy, fááá a guy, and never see him again kind of girl. - I can't wait to use this hot tub. - I don't think we're allowed, though. - Oh, no. I'm gonna enjoy it. I'm gonna enjoy this yacht just like the charter guests. Whenever we get off and we get an opportunity, you gotta enjoy yourself. - Jen, can you grab some sodas for the stews? - "Daniel, and you and Bobby "come to talk to me about important things "while, Jen, you just stay and drool and draw the alphabet?" - What? Why does that bother you so much? - 'Cause I like to be important. - We're all important. We're all part of the team. - I've worked on and off for seven years on boats, and I don't like being lumped into the same category with Daniel. I don't want to be the little weak one that's new to the industry. Things better change fast. I'll be polite this trip. - This trip? - Hey, Captain. How you doing? - Oh, hey. I'm not Captain here. - What's going on? Give us the highlights. - Yeah, so we've had one charter so far. It was really cool. My father and I have a great relationship. He was the one who taught me how to play football and ride a bike. He's a mentor to me, and he's someone who I look up to very much. As soon as I got here, they promoted me to chief officer. - Wow. - I got the three-stripe epaulettes, and, uh-- - Whoo, look at you. - I think I do get a lot of drive from watching my father over the years. You know, he owns his own firm. He's an architect, and he doesn't take any sááá. If something's wrong, he's gonna let the person know. Everything's going well. - Enjoy yourself. - All right. Will do, Dad. - Good. - I love you. - Bye. Okay. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. - Let's start a bottle. - Cheers. Ching, ching, guys. - Cheers. - It's about it. It feels like two days has been, like, a week, right? - Or a month. - I have no idea. - Are you really drinking out of a bottle? - Don't we have wine glasses? - This is my glass. It's in a glass, therefore it is a glass of wine. - You're just, like, a paper bag away from being a hobo. - Times are tough on the "Ionian Princess." - How does your shirt not get all wrinkled? - My maid folds it right. - Oh, you got a maid? - I need an adult. - All right, let's go, let's go. Let's do it. - It's good to be off the boat. - I know. - I'm gonna marry Ben. His last name is Robinson. So I can be Mrs. Robinson and date younger men. - I got you. Because Hannah's been in the industry for a couple years, she knows what it looks like to win. I see it today, you know? And I think she has a mutual respect for me as I managed my own team in my own style and she managed her own team in her own style. Let's have fun tonight, all right? - You're the best. Watching a 31-year-old woman skulling wine out a bottle, I'm embarrassed to be seen with her, to be honest. - I'm gonna throw up. - I'm gonna throw up. Oh, no. - You just ripped my shirt. - Coming up... - Not the time and place. - You do your managering skills the way you want to-- - And I'll do mine. - Have you got a butt in the seat now? - Two butts. - Shall I go next to you 'cause I'm small? - That works. Yes, Julia. You should sit next to me. - And is everyone okay with wine? - Yeah. - I love wine. - Okay. - Red on my end. I love to drink. - Okay, so, entrée for us is, like, starter for them. - Entrée and starter are the same thing in Europe. - That's what she's saying. - Okay, yeah. - Yes, exactly. - Wait, is the entrée the main in America? - Entrée is main. - Yeah. - Yes. - I'm really interested in trying that, actually. - And shrimps. - Jen and I don't eat seafood. - Well, don't eat it. - Boom! Snap! I love it! - Because my degree's in marine biology, I know that blue whales ejaculate 20 liters per load. Maybe that's why the ocean's so salty? - Shrimps with grilled zucchini. - Thank you. - This is saganaki with cheese. - That's insane. - Nice roast potatoes. - I don't think we're gonna need to order mains after this. - Oh, this is delicious. - So, Julia, what do you got waiting back home for you? - In terms of what? - Like, do you have, like, a boyfriend or a significant other? - Yeah. I have a boyfriend. Been with him for, like, two years. - Oh, really? You've been with him for two years? - Of course she has a boyfriend. The good ones are always taken. - No, I don't. I've been pretty lucky like that. I think I want to be married in the next six years. - Have you got a girlfriend? - No. - Propose, get married, spit out kids. - Well, I'm pretty spontaneous. I just haven't really met the right one, you know? - Ben's a good-looking guy. He's not my typical type, but I think there's a lot to be said for good chemistry. - I would love to. Ahh. - There's something about Tiff that's very easy about her. There's no frills. No. I love her "I don't give a fááá" attitude. - Cheers. - It's been three days. - Cheers. - Cheers, guys. - Cheers. - Mom. - Trash bag daughter. Ohh! - I like my drink. I get my party on. I'm not a "mom." Guys, let's go. Come on. - Yes, mom. Go, go, go, go. - Holy sháá, look how bright the moon is. - We are in Greece and fireballing and I'm stoked on that. - Yeah. - I love fireballs. Whoo! - Okay, I pick him. - Wow. - Yes. - Okay. - Can we join? - Yeah. - Of course you can. - Please do. - Hey, listen, stop. That's too harsh. - It's a joke, okay? She called me a mom and I called her a trash bag. - I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it. I just don't like that term, that's all. - Okay, how's my little lovely third stewardess? - Thank you. There you go. That's better. - She's good. She's at the bar drinking. - I'm gonna go grab a drink. - Okay, big guy. - Cheers. - Hey. - I feel like you don't have any awareness, honey. And I got up at 8:00, and I've had no breaks the whole charter. I've been a chief stew on five yachts, and what I won't work with is attitude. So the fact that Tiffany's complaining about being tired is really grating on my nerves. - Hannah is the epitome of the reason that I hang out with boys. I just want to get drunk and not talk about feelings. - I understand you might want to work on the deck, and that might be your passion, but at the same time, you're a grown-up, and you need to take responsibility for what you've signed on for. - Yeah, yeah. - I don't know why Hannah's wasting her time. She's obviously not gonna remember any coaching or advice, and frankly, she's bringing down the mood of everyone. - Bryan doesn't know what's going on. Stay in your own department. - I'm in Greece. I just got paid. There's two pretty girls at the bar, and if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. I just want to have a good time. That's all that matters. - I'm just sorry that on your night off to have fun that you had to be confronted with that. - Fááá, I hate her. - Are you crying? A little bit. - No. - Oh, God. So sorry. When we go out for drinks, it should separate work, you know? People need incentive to work, and Hannah hasn't quite figured that out. If you don't give them a chance and you initially label them as lazy or bad or whatever it may be, then they are gonna fit that mold. You have a very good attitude, and I would like you to stick for it, you know? I would like you to stick with it. - I'm not quitting anytime soon. Not yet. - No, I just think you can do it. - Thanks, Mr. Robinson. - I think Tiffany's really cute. She's cool. Like, yeah, she's weird but she's smart, and I like that. I'm weird. Sometimes smart. Fááá it, let's do some shots. - No way. You'll be carrying me home. - That's fine. You're about 90 pounds. I could sling you over my shoulder, and I wouldn't even notice. - Hey. - Are you upset with me? - Yeah. - Why? - Me and Tiffany have had issues the past few days. - Yeah. - And we needed to have that chat. - Hannah. - Yeah? - But this is not the best time to do constructive criticism. This is a time for us to let loose. - Oh, really? - Yes. - Yeah? Yeah? Have you been dealing with her for three days straight? - No, I haven't. - Okay, exactly. Your department is the deck. - Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Back it up. I think Hannah's forgetting the hierarchy, because I am the first officer. The whole entire boat's my department, and on my boat I want as least amount of drama as possible. - Oh, I feel like vomiting. - All right, let's go, guys. - The truth comes out when everyone's drunk. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Sometimes it's easier to talk to people when they're a little bit more relaxed. - She's absolutely sháá-faced. - Of course, I understand this. - How are you gonna try to-- - But at least it breaks the barriers. - No matter what you tell her, do you think she's gonna remember it? - My job as the chief stew is to have a nice fáááing conversation, so fááá off. - Here and now is not the place. - Guys-- - Are you kidding me? I don't know who the fááá he thinks he is. He's not gonna get away with speaking to me like that. - Let's go, guys. - Come on. Let's go. Just stop. - Hey, hey, hey. - Can we back to the boat please? - Trying to give you my honest opinion. Can you respect that? - Be the bigger man. - You do your managering skills the way you like to do it... - And I'll do mine. - And she does hers. - Next time on Mediterranean"... - Have you ever been on a yacht? - You can't take girls to the boat. - You have five minutes! - They have to go home. - Have you ever heard of a restaurant called The Tilted Kilt? - Yes, sir. - What food is that? - We don't lower our standards. We're just simplifying. - They chartered this yacht to do a photo shoot. - Can we have him oiling her shoulders? - Yes. - I'll take the oil. - There you go. - No fraternizing with the models. - Of course. - I like your vibe. - That's beyond inappropriate. - I'm gonna kiss you. - It's just completely unacceptable. - Just fáááed it up. I'm sorry. I'm usually strong. - For more information Mediterranean,"
