[laughs] You move mountains. - That's our job. - 15,000 Euros for three days. That's not too bad. [upbeat dance music] - Cheers. - What is your name? - Oh, Danny boy's getting a number. - I have no idea what's going on right now.

 - You're not trying your hardest. You're fáááing up at work... I'm just trying to gauge how it took you 4 1/2 hours to do all that. And then you're walking down the street sculling out of a bottle of wine. - She's absolutely shááfaced. - Your department isn't at deck. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Hannah's forgetting the hierarchy. I am the first officer, and on my boat, I want as least amount of drama as possible. - Guys, guys... [dramatic music] [boat horn blows]

 [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Me and Tiffany have had issues the past few days - This is not the time or place to do this. You're absolutely wasted. What's the point? - I'm absolutely wasted? Wha-- You can't talk to me like that. I don't know who the fááá he thinks he is. - Why should I be here? - Oh, is it really? - I feel like vomiting. - All right, let's go, guys. - I don't care what you think. My job as a chief stew is to have a nice fáááing conversation, so fááá off. - Not right here--right here? - Guys, guys, guys, no. - Let's go, guys. - Come on, let's go. - All right. - If I may be-- - Stop. - Relax, okay? - Yeah, I know--I'm relaxed. - Let her come to you. That's fine. Just chill. - All right, let's go. - It seems like Bryan loves power. He loves to be above people. If he doesn't feel that, it pisses him off. - Let's go. - He's drunk. - That's not cool, though. - Ladies, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. - You gotta maintain. I'm maintaining myself. - When the guests aren't on board, we get to enjoy the yacht as if it was our own. - Have we got the girls coming with us? - Really, the girls in the fáááing see-through thongs? I'm so not impressed. - Have you ever been on a yacht? - You can't take girls to the boat. It's, like, a written rule, if you ever brought someone back, you're fired. - If you bring home girls from a bar to a yacht that is not yours, you will be fired. - Bye, get fired. Bye. - Well, let's take you for a little tour. - Don't take them into the guest cabins 'cause I cleaned them. I've done the beds. That's not happening. I feel like I'm in summer camp with these guys. It's bedtime. Good night, guys. - Are you going to bed? - Yeah. - That's lame. - You got the top deck. We got the hot tub, girl. What would you like to drink? A liquor, beer... - Okay. My mom raised me to respect women, to treat them right, so that's what I do. Treat women right. - Oh, my God, you got Patrón? - Yeah, why not? - We are in Greece. - Cheers. - Cheers, guys. - You're cooking octopus? - Yeah. - Right now? - Yeah. Eat that and you won't puke. I promise. - How many girls on board are not crew? - Two here. - Just chill, guys. We're gonna deal with this, all right? - Excuse me, Hannah, as the chief steward, I just want to make sure, can we bring our hookups back here? - Bryan was sticking his nose in my business. Meanwhile, his boys are running amok and bringing girls back on board, which isn't allowed. The boat is certainly not a place to get drunk. You know, we try to preserve the boat for the, uh, guests' and owners' use. - It's not rocket science. Manage your people. - Perhaps you'll provide me with condoms and vodka. - [laughs] [dramatic music] - So the girls are getting off, okay? - Are they? - Yeah. They're done. ♪ ♪ - What time's the flight? - 5:30. - Holy sháá, that's, like, three fáááing hours. - Yeah, I have to, like... - Hey, guys. - Hello. - We are closing the party. - Okay. - So you guys can hop off and go to bed, so... - Okay, Roger that. You got it. - This is my boat, so... - You got it, Hannah. - Mm-kay. I'm giving you guys five minutes... - That's all we need. - And then we're... closing the party. - I'm not drinking this. - You know what's more important to me? - [laughs] - Oh, my God, you're gonna drink it, aren't you. - No, no, no, no. There's nothing more important to me than my job and my career, so ladies, that means you have to get off. I do not want to make our chief stew mad. It was excellent to meet you ladies. both: Yeah. - I should have known better bringing some random girls back to a multi-million dollar yacht, but I was drinking. - Bye. - Jasmine and Allie, I leave you. - Hey, how's the octopus? - Oh, wow. It's actually really good. - So good. - Course it's fáááing good. I cooked it. - I--huge gut. - I'm really sorry, but I got the girls off the boat. - It's all good to me. - I sent those hoes on their way. - I'm gone for two seconds, what the fááá just happened? - Was that you? - No. - No, Danny, did. Not me. - Oh, so Danny did. - He's putting some work in. - Let's talk outside, guys. I'm kind of in a hot spot right now. I had no idea that there was girls on the boat, and the last thing I want is the captain having to concern himself with exterior crew. - You should have heard, Hannah. She was like, "You just need to leave." She was pulling the mama bear kind of thing. - Don't worry, I'll talk to the captain. These guys are green, but rules are rules. At the end of the day, I'm sure Captain will understand. Tripod. - Tripod, bro. [both laughing] - This is it right here, bro. No one's gonna fááá with us. We're untouchable. - Everyone else is just riding along. - Boom. - There, exactly. Let's get the fááá out of here. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Was that from last night? - Yeah. - That looks like it felt good. - I have no idea what that's from. [laughs] - So what did Hannah tell you last night? - She just made it sound like she's amazing and I'm a piece of sháá. I'm not sure if things are resolved between Hannah and I, but I really don't fáááing care. [laughs] I need to be exterior. Like, this is too much. - Has Tiffany spoken to you at all about last night? - No, not at all. - I am in a bit of a hard situation 'cause you know how amazing I think you are... - Yeah. - But I can't be playing... - No, yeah. - Favorites. - Having a chief stew with really high standards, you know, is the norm for me. Tiff's definitely gonna have to step up her game and start getting the jobs done. - We'll try and keep the crying to, like, two, three times a week. - [laughs] - That was fun last night. So, uh, think, uh, you're gonna try to make a move on Hannah? - No. - No? - I don't thinks he has a gay bone in her body. - [laughs] Who's gonna have the first kiss? - You're 0 for 1. - Damn. [laughs] ♪ ♪ - Captain? - Yes? - How you doing? - Pretty good. Just looking to see where we're gonna be going tomorrow. - Okay, great. Uh, quick question, Captain. I'd like to confirm your policy when it comes to visitors on board. It's generally a rule, you don't bring girls back to the boat. It's not a big deal, but Captain's unaware that this happened, and if he's gonna hear it from somebody, I want it to be from me. - This is--the boat's not a party place... - Sure. - So we can't really consider it as our own home. That's not cool unless I know about it. - Oh, fááá. As a mate in trial period, I want to be completely honest with you, and everything I know, I want you to know, obviously. You're the master of the vessel. Last night, two females came on after we were out. - Really? - Yeah. - What time was that? - Around 1:00. I was unaware of it. - So Bobby and, uh, Danny? - Danny, yeah. - [clicks tongue] What are those guys thinking? - You know, I don't want to let down the guys. I don't want to get them in trouble, but at the end of the day, this is a reflection of me, and my job could be at stake trying to save their ass. I just want you to be made aware 'cause I want to be completely transparent with you, so if it's okay with you, I'd like to be the one to, you know, break the news to them that you weren't happy about it. - I'll talk to them both, and there'll be a consequence for that. - I'm taken back a little bit. Uh, I didn't think he was gonna be this upset. - Bobby wouldn't have brought somebody back to a firehouse and parked her on the fire truck. - You're absolutely right. It will be a good teaching moment. - Yes, it will for everybody. [upbeat electronic music] - Did you eat that octopus last night? - Octopus? - You were probably busy doing other things. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Having seen Danny in action... - What's going on? How y'all doing today? - Look at this guy. - So entertaining. Look, as long as the heats off me, I'm fine. - Did you make any moves on anyone? - Did I? - I have no clue. - Um... - You got your eye on anyone, by any chance? - I don't know yet. Danny's got a lot to learn. I'm gonna do my best to protect him. I'm always one for the underdog. In my position, relationships can kind of screw everything up a little bit. - They're gonna want more food from you. They're gonna expect you to cook some more. [both laugh] - I'm a deep guy, you know? Anyone I talk to, I wanna find out what they're about. I don't want any of that fake stuff, you know? Give it to me real. Give it to me raw. - If you're gonna do it, it has to be right, you know? 'Cause otherwise... you're an assáááá. - [laughs] I don't take you as a sweet guy, man. I don't know. - Right, okay, forget the assáááá thing, all right. - Okay, okay, go on. - It makes it difficult for me. [both laugh] [upbeat quirky music] ♪ ♪ - How're you doing, Tiffany? - Good. - Yeah? How much have you done from that list? - I need to do the wine still. - Yeah? The thing with Tiffany that I hope she realizes is that I'm not trying to be a bitch. I'm just trying to do my job, and sometimes it is my job to be a bitch when someone's not doing theirs. And the cabins are all done? - Yes. Looks like we're sweeping something under the rug here, and I am okay with that. - So and, yeah, when you have a minute, try and hop into one of these. - Yep. - Okay. [walkie-talkie clicks] - Bryan, Bryan, Mark. Could you and, um, Bobby and Danny come on up to the bridge for a sec? - Uh-oh. - Oh, God. - Roger that. It's not always bad when you get called into the wheelhouse, right? [tense music] - Um, the topic of discussion is what happened after the club last night. I was hoping what I had said about not partying on the boat would sink in, and obviously it hasn't. I want you guys to fill me in on it a little bit. Danny, you'll--you go first. - I want to take some of the blame for that too because-- - Oh, you are. - Coming up... - Have you heard of a Tilted Kilt? - Models on the yacht. Yes. - Oh, Cheyenne! - She got this "I'm a bad girl" vibe. You know what I mean? - What? - Ah, here we go. - It's so big. - I was hoping what I had said about not partying on the boat would sink in, and obviously it hasn't. I want you guys to fill me in on it a little bit. Danny, you'll--you go first. - Um, I want to take some of the blame for that too because-- - Oh, you are. - We, uh, went to the club, and, um, ended up bringing a couple guests back on board. They never went inside the yacht. It was just on the sun deck. - 15, 20 minutes max. - And what did you serve 'em? - Patrón, I believe. - So boat's liquor? - Yes, sir. - The whole thing is a problem. I'm responsible for the boat... - Yes, Captain. - And we don't know who these gals are. It's just completely unacceptable. As a consequence to your activities of last night, this is strike number one. Three strikes, you're out. Uh, you'll be assigned an additional watch together when we have a break after this charter. You'll be assigned some duties that will be beneficial to everybody, and you'll be doing them together. - Okay. - Sounds good. - Um, you guys can go ahead and go. Bryan, hang on just for a second. [door clicks open] - Thanks, guys. - I didn't realize that they were drinking the boat liquor, did you? - I did not. - I'm a little concerned that Bryan doesn't know these guys, but anybody that is a part of your team, reflects upon you as the, um--as the team leader. I'm disappointed I didn't get a--as full a story from you when you first told me about this. - Okay, I'm gonna tell you everything that I know. I'm gonna be completely honest and transparent with you. You know, I'm lucky I didn't face any repercussions myself, being in charge of the deck crew, but I gotta make sure this doesn't happen again. - Okay, great. So let's carry on and have a great charter. - Okay. - That was the punishment he gave us? To do the wat-- - [whistles] So what do you think, guys? - Ah, ah, dude, I'm--I'm not worried about it. - Sorry I couldn't do more on your behalf. He could have been harsher. One day watch, no big deal. We'll learn from it. It's not gonna happen again. It's just a learning lesson. - I was just saying to him, I don't even know what I was thinking-- well, obviously I was wasted. - [laughs] - I don't know why I didn't come to you and ask. - That was--that was a big fááá up. - I don't expect Bryan to cover for me at all. That's my fault. I put him in that situation that he had to tell the captain, and I was ready to take my licks, whatever my licks may be. - Let's knock it out, guys. - Sounds good. - Hannah, Ben, Bryan, could you please report to the bridge? - Copy for Hannah and Ben. - Have you ever heard of a restaurant called The Tilted Kilt? - Yeah, yeah. I go there all the time. - It's like Hooters, isn't it? - It's a sports bar. - It's a sports bar. - They just put one up in Fort Lauderdale. - Yeah, I've been to that one, actually. Um, but, um, what we've got are girls that are all waitresses at the restaurants, and they have chartered this yacht, uh, to do a photo shoot. - Oh, I can't wait to tell the guys. I've done my fair share of working charters, but never have I had eight smoking hot chicks doing a photo shoot. - As much fun as this sounds, we've got to remember, no fraternizing with the models. - No staring. - This is the den mother, and, uh, she's gonna be the primary client. - So we need to keep Katie happy. - Interestingly enough, they all eat the same thing as, uh, Kate Winterhalter. - These names are so unique. - Presley Rhodes. - Summer Blair. - Maybe they're, like, stripper names. - Stage names. - Stage names. At 2:30, we've got pick up photographer and hair/makeup team. It's a sunset shoot on board the boat. Monday, it's going to be a beach shoot. They're gonna want all the water sports equipment as props. Be professional about it. - Sure. - So you have to spend a day hanging out with models in bikinis. - I know, this job is so tough. - You poor man. I'm used to high-end charters and people with lots of money, so it's a bit easier when you have clientele like this because they don't really know what to expect, and they would never notice if you made a mistake. - Then it's the post-shoot champagne and sushi dinner. - Yes, sir. - You got lots of sushi? - No, but I know a sushi chef down the road, and he's got this, you know-- no, I'm just kidding. [laughs] I love doing sushi. It's very clean, it's very contained, and it's impressive. Between you and I, it's actually not that difficult, but let's just roll with the whole impressive thing right now. - Awesome. - Sweet, so it sounds like it's gonna be quite a easy-ish charter if they're working. - Yeah. - Plus, they're all waitresses themselves. - Functional kind of work thing, yeah. - It's gonna be fun. - All right. - Thank you. - Thanks, Captain. - Thank you. - Cheers. - It's gonna be a fun trip. I'm excited. [upbeat electronic music] - Deck team, assemble. Deck team, assemble. All right, so, guys, are you familiar with The Tilted Kilt? - Yes! - Whoa, yeah. - They're gonna do a photo shoot.

I'm working out right now. - Yo, Bobby. - How many can you do? - Here we go. Here we go, babe. Here we go. - The guys are acting like this is the first time they've seen women, ever. - She got this cute, innocent... - She's got a innocent look. - But "I'm a bad girl" vibe. You know what I mean? - Would you hang on to this, so he doesn't take it to his bedroom? - I'm not-- [both laugh] - The cool strategy if you want a really hot girl, you have to kind of not really notice the girl. Letting the girls kind of come to you. - Yeah, if there is a charter guest that wants to take it to the next level-- - You gotta remain professional. - What-- - Fááá me, man. Yeah, you're gonna say something like that and show us this. - We're working on a yacht. We're working, right? We're working, and as much as we want to be buddy-buddy and do that, we cannot cross that line of professionalism. After the whole dilemma with the girls coming on board, it's really important to me that Captain can see that I'm capable of running a competent deck crew. - What time on deck tomorrow? - 8:00 sharp. - Wolf pack, wolf pack. - Game on. - Come on, baby. - Good charter ahead, guys. all: Boom. - [laughs] [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ [Skype call rings] - Hi, Mom. - I miss you too, Mom.

Greece is very nice, and this is definitely different than any of the other yachting jobs I've had. I really had to mature at a young age. My father's an alcoholic, and I had to really step up. I had to help pay the bills and take care of my sisters and my mom and my dad. It was one of those things that you couldn't just think about. You just had to--you had to do. Did you get the money I sent you? - Uh-huh. I miss you, Mom. - Yeah, come. - I'm sorry, Mom, I know I'm usually strong. - With yachting, I can still make my mom proud. I want to make her proud.

It's not your normal sit down, have a meal, and serve them. We don't lower our standards. We're just simplifying. - If somebody asks, obviously, you just make whatever they want, but you can kind of push them.
