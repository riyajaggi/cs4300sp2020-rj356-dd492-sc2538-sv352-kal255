 It's hard having a long-distance relationship. It's like losing your best friend, you know? - Our next charter is one of Dallas's most eligible bachelors. - Damn, that photo did not do him justice. I guess I'm a f---ing bad chief stew then, all right? - Maybe Bugsy should be the chief stew. - This is a really low blow from Adam. - If my second stew doesn't have my back over the chef, I'm very f---ing pissed off. - So it's you that's gonna carry me on to the boat, yeah? - Me? - Yeah. - Carry you? - Yeah. - Jason, would you like a cosmo?

 - Only if you make it. - I've never heard of a chief stewardess who flirts with the charter guests. It is completely unacceptable. - Thanks for all the great service. - My pleasure. - See you again, all right. - Jason, you off to bed? [boat horn blows] [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Thanks for all the great service. - My pleasure. - See you again, all right. - Good night. Jason? You off to bed? - Yeah. - You need, uh... - Assistance. Thank you for all your hard work. [kiss] [whispers] I love your little-- [zipper sound] - Ahh...My God. [energetic music] ♪ ♪ ♪ [upbeat music] [clock alarm beeping] ♪ ♪ - Max? - Yo, bro. - Do you have a special outfit for your girl? - Yeah, his birthday suit. - Yeah, just naked. - Naked. - [laughs] Does she like to drink? - No, she doesn't drink. - Really? - Ha ha ha. Much. My girlfriend's coming to town, and she's a dancer, currently in Dubai. It's literally been six weeks since I've seen her, so Shalom! you try going six weeks without having sex, you know? It's hard. - How are you? - Well, who didn't? - I was very confused when Hannah came in, 'cause it was, like, really early, and I thought I was late for work, and I was like, "What's going on? What's going on?" and she was like, "Oh, no, I'm just getting to bed now." - For you too? - Oh, God, no. - Not like Hannah? - I went to bed at 2:30. - Okay. I hope she wasn't partying with them. - As chief stew, I would leave your second stew on late so you can be up to greet them and see what they want to do for the day. I think she's taking advantage of the fact that none of us actually know when she goes to bed. - Pull the [inaudible] in, and let's get out of here. All crew, all crew, we are ready to depart. Max to the bow, Max to the bow. - [yawns] - Good morning. - Ready to rock and roll. - Cap, stern is free to move. - All right, Wes. I'm gonna want to start hearing distances. Distance, Wesley, distance, please. - Yeah, copy that. You still are very clear. If you swing over now, it should be deep enough it'll be good. - Just keep communicating distances, locations. Wes does not know how to delegate, which is annoying for me because the other crew members aren't learning. - Good morning. - You want a muffin? - What are they? - Nut muff. I'm really looking forward to spending time with Malia off the boat. I'm smitten over this girl. Get your nut muffs. - Don't get all chamoised. - [laughing] - Morning. - It feels so good out here. - I know--oh. [object clatters] - What is it with you and cell phones this weekend? ♪ ♪ - Ready Freddy. - Did you order oatmeal? - Oatmeal? - She did, okay. - Let's go eat. Oh, wow. - There she is. - Good morning, sunshine. - Hey, good morning, morning. - Can I get some scrambled eggs and hash browns? - Sure thing. - And can we send somebody to check on Hannah just to make sure she's okay? - She's my cabin mate, so-- - So she's okay? - She's good. She's good. - She's all good? - She took my cell phone to dry it out. - Okay. - Oh, sh--. - Do you want me to put it in rice? - I'll check up on that for you. I definitely think Hannah sleeping in has got an effect on our work because it's me trying to serve breakfast while Lauren's down in the cabins. It would be nice to have the support. - [inaudible]. - I just wanted to check if you had a cell phone down in the engine room with you. - No. - I feel a bit guilty 'cause it's not something that I've done before in my career in yachting. Ballsy move, Ferrier, ballsy move. - Good morning. - They wanted me to come check on your pulse to see if you were alive. - And I have your phone. - Oh, good. - Do you want to keep it in the rice? - No, I'll take it. - Take it out? - There's a very low likelihood that this works. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hey. - Hello. - Well, maybe the reason it's not working is the battery's dead now, huh? - Mm. - I appreciate his attempt at discretion because I don't want to lose my job, so I guess I will just keep my mouth shut as well, which is probably what I should have done last night. - So nothing's happening, right? - Except rice falling on my lap. - That's about it. - You never know. - Wes, Wes, you're gonna be docking the boat. - Good luck in there. - Thank you, Captain. I'll make my way to the bridge. - Two captains I worked under, they never allowed me on the bridge, and I just thought if I ever have that opportunity, I'm going to allow my crew to experience what it's like to move up in this career. - Sleep well? - Oh, good. - Okay, guys, you're driving from starboard wing station. Definitely nervous. I mean, docking the boat for the first time, it's a lot different than taking it off. Having a girl on the mind makes things difficult, and I need to focus on this. Max, can you tell me distances in front? - I'd say 12 meters. - You need to look forward. - Wes, you're looking good. Just come straight in. - We're getting close now, making the final approach. What's the distance, Max? - Probably 7 meters. - 5 meters. - Don't hit it anyone. That boat's in front of you. - So we're in. - Well done. - Yes! Bobby, just pull in the [inaudible]. We're in safely. - Yay! - Nice job, Cap'n Wes. - I don't want to go home. - I don't either. Maybe just hide underneath the bed. - Did you have fun? - Yeah, we had a great time. Can I get your email address or something? - Yeah. - Do you have a pen? You guys in town for--you stay here for a day or so or? - No, we're here for... four weeks. - We're here till Friday. Yeah. - Yeah? - All crew, all crew, everyone to the dock, and let's line up. - We're off now. - Okay, all right... - Okay, well... - I'll see you. - I'll say good-bye to you downstairs. - Take care. - Yeah, you too. As much as I loved having him on the boat, he's a bit of a distraction. - Don't fall, don't fall. I'm not used to wearing shoes again. Thank you so much. - Safe travels back home. - It was so much fun. - Thank you for putting up with all of my banter. - Thank you so much. I'm glad you had a good time. - Pleasure. - Thank you so much. It was so nice to meet you. - Yeah, you too. - Thanks for everything. - It was an amazing trip. - Good. - For many reasons. Something like this, it's not a vacation. It's a lifelong memory, and we had a lot of fun when everyone set up the fun event for the Cuban party, That was great. We probably gained 15 pounds each because of this guy's cooking, which was phenomenal. Hannah and her team, they were there every second of every day, and it was incredible. I have a little something I'd like to leave behind just to show our appreciation, so I will leave this for you. - Oh, thank you very much. - And thank you all, guys. We really appreciated it, so... - Bye, thank you. - Take care, everyone. - Bye. - Cheers. - That is one fine ass. [laughter] - Okay, back to work. All crew, all crew, meet me in the main salon for our tip meeting. I know all of us are gonna get pulled in at one time to want to party with the guests while on charter. - F---. - I just wanted to say... [suspenseful music] - I know all of us are gonna get - I know all of us are gonna get pulled in at one time to want to party with the guests while on charter. We don't do that. We're a professional boat. You do not allow it to happen. - Whew. Sometimes it's not really what you do. It's what you get away with. - However, the clients were very happy. I just want to point out table settings. They were so beautiful, and Adam, you did it. Your colorful seven-course meal, you blew them away. Even though he did his job, I want to make sure that Adam's on top of his game. His food has to be perfect. Now two things, $15,000, so $1,400 roughly a piece, and I've arranged for you to go to see the fortress for the day. - Whoo! - So after you have your- - Cool. - Tip meeting. - That's awesome. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Here's your $1,400. Have fun. We pick up our charter in two days. - Yay! - Yay! - Do you want me to convert this to dollars? - No, she told us what it was in dollars, 1,400. - Oh, so she did. [laughs] ♪ ♪ - Hello? Hello? Hi. - And then Max's room's over here. - Hi. - Hi. I'm a hugger. - Max's girlfriend, she's a babe. - Oh, we're so excited to have you. - Hi. - I'm Bobby. Nice to meet you. - How are you? - Good. - Where is he? - Oh, Max? - He's inside the bathroom. - Max? - Max! - Dive right in. - Max, open the door! - What are you doing in there? - Oh, typical. That reflects our relationship a lot, if I'm honest. - It would probably be a good idea to get out of here. [light music] ♪ ♪ - Oh, hey. - Hi. - Hi, babe. - How are you? - I've not seen Emily in six weeks, and the first smell she gets when she walks on the boat is Adam's food second time around. - I missed you. Oh, it's so small in here. How do you manage? - It's really glamorous living. It's glamorous. - Oh, I can tell. It looks so comfortable. - Five stars. - Seen Adam? - Yeah. - What are we gonna do now? - The best cook on the boat. - Yeah! [laughter] - Fortress. - What do I need? Do I need, like, a bikini? - No, you don't--unless you want to walk around the fortress in a bikini. - I don't know what a fortress is. - Like a big castle. - Oh, right, okay. - Oh, my God, these two are just perfect for each other. - It's all making sense. - Let's do this. - Ready, guys? - And you just walked over the baby. - It's better than stepping on him. - Do we need three people in the back? - Oh, my God, it's so beautiful. - Do you know, this is like 300 B.C? - It's almost ancient. - I thought I heard it through the grapevine. - What kind of grapevine is that? [laughter] - The Fortress of Klis played a huge part in the Croatian history. I'm in love with it. It's beautiful. - Photo op! - Wow, that's cool. - Wow, guys, this is a new profile picture, hey? All righty, let's carry on up. - You guys, watch your step. - Oh, my God. What is this? - Please let us make it through this charter season alive. - Oh, my God, they're fighting. They're fighting. They're fighting. - Damn. - We come in peace. - What? Me? - The girl with long brown hair. - Lauren! - Whoo! [overlapping chatter] - Go for his head, Lauren. - Yep. - I can think of better areas. - Thank you. - Who's next? - Look at that view. - Such a good view. - Don't fall, please. You all right? - Taking it all in. - I'm just glad you're here. - So how's everything been on the boat? - It's all right. It's nice, like, until I tell you the love triangle. Do you want to know the love triangle? Bobby likes Malia, and then Malia started kissing Wes, and Adam's the chef. - All right, okay, I'm following. - She hooked up with them two-- - What, at the same time? - In the same night. And then I've just been like, "Well, you know, you guys crack on. I've got Emily, so... - Good. - I'm not really a relationship man until I met this girl, and yeah, I like to think it's serious. I'm so glad you're here. - Yes. - Here's another one. Come on. Let's go and find the others. - Oh! - I almost split the arrow! - Croatia! Ah! - One, two, three. - Amazing. - It's absolutely beautiful. - How's it going? - All right. How are you? - When you're mad because I'm not giving you enough attention, like...no. - Yay! - It's all right. We found them. - Let's get out of here. - Let's go eat some dinner. - Yes. - Okay, let's race down. No, that was a joke. That was a joke. - Well, that was good fun. - I'm really proud I didn't fall over or trip. - There's still time. There's still time. - I'm wearing a leather jacket tonight. - I just love my Bobby hugs. - You suckered me. - Starboard forward. - Is this starboard forward? - Oh, sh--. - Heavy door for a boat. - It's a water seal so I don't have to listen to you when you're in the bathroom. - Funny, you. - Like, you see that? I might need to go with the nip covers tonight. - Look at you, girl. - Let's go. - Oh, it's bloody freezing. - Oh, my God, it's way too windy for this skirt. - Bobby, I might have to wear your leather jacket, bro. - Are we separating? - Awkward, okay. - Let's get a red wine. - No, let's go with a cab sauv. - Where's the bathroom? - I'd tell you if you didn't walk away. - Malia? - Hey. - Yeah, we'll go have a chat somewhere. - Oh, God. - So what's happening with you and Adam? - He asked me out on a date tomorrow. - That's cool. I just wanted to say... But if not, also, I'd like to pursue something. - Yeah, I don't know. - Yeah, no? - I am--I--I think you know how I feel about you. - Mm. - And--but, you know, Adam asked me out on a date, and I don't know what's happening in that situation, you know? - Yeah. Just follow your heart. Do what you got to do. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - It feels right. It feels natural. It feels how it should be. I've made my stand, and I've let her know that she needs to now figure it out herself. - Man, this Wes thing is still happening, you know? - We have an extra seat here, Hannah. - I'll finish my cigarette with you guys. - Yeah, you can go for it, buddy. Just top that thing off. [laughter] - How's the relationship coming on? - It's not totally unreasonab-- - I--and I see that now. - We work side by side every day, and I told him we're going on a date tomorrow. I just got to figure out what's going on there, you know? - Can someone--Can you guys watch my bag? I'm just-- - Yes. - Thank you. I don't know, like...I don't want any part of this. - It's hard to be in this position, and instead of, like, understanding at all, you're just being an asshole. - Please don't call me that. I'm trying to figure this out. Put yourself in my shoes for two seconds. I mean, I can only assume when I see you walking back holding someone else's hand, I feel pretty confident that I'm out of the picture. - By what? He's known you for, like, five days, and that's how you console him, by leading him on? - Wow, bor-ing! - I'm having a great time just being out and about. - Uh... I had big plans for you. Before that and that showed up here... - Yeah. [dramatic musical sting] - Do you guys want - Do you guys want to go inside to the bar? - Yeah, let's go inside. - Uh... I had big plans for you. Before that and that showed up here... I thought it was the Malia and Adam show. - Yeah. [dramatic musical flourish] - Adam and I met at our yacht certification courses in Florida three weeks before we joined the yacht. We decided it would be best to just keep it a secret from the crew. - What's your name? - Malia. - Hi, Malia. Just hand her off, please. I appreciate that. Just looking to spend a little time with you. Here I feel like I've barely even met you. - She's too smart for you, honey. - Yeah, little do you know. - I've never been to Greece. - I've never been to Greece either. Where do you want to go? Being in a couple before you actually get on the boat, it can make things really awkward for the rest of the crew, and I don't want to give the rest of the crew that impression. - But then I got on the boat. I met Wes, and I fell for Wes, and Adam doesn't like that. - No. - We went from having this potential great thing to all lies, all lies. - He held my hand back to the table. That's an innocent gesture, okay? - What? Since when? Where--what--what country are you from? - You need to stop thinking so much into it. Everything's fine now. - You sure? - Yes. - Please don't break my heart. - I'm not trying to break your heart at all. At some point you got to just-- - Trust you? - Yeah. - Wes, let's hear it, come on. - All right, all right. I was like, "All right, that's cool." Like, we hugged it out, and yeah. - Dude, you need to f---ing pull out of that, dude. - Mate. - She's playing you. - Malia is not actually this "player." I believe that she's actually genuine. - You're f---ing way better than that. - Bye, guys. - Are you going? [overlapping chatter] - Go get some sleep. - Thank you. I don't really feel like being around these people right now. - I don't know how Wes would feel if he found out that Malia and I have had relations prior to being here. - Well, I'm not going over to that table. - There'll be a thousand more stewardesses for you to hit on, I promise, bro. - I don't want to be that guy running around sleeping with many people. Like, I just want that one sort of real good, real connection. - Whoo! Everyone, fun time. - Bugsy! - Whoo! Where's my friend, vodka? - It's right behind you. Oh, oh, okay. [laughter, overlapping chatter] - My nipples could cut glass right now. - Is there a reason you're running away from me? - I'm just trying to get to the boat. - Okay, right, let's go, you two. That one's for that one. - I love it when you're so domestic. ♪ ♪ - Adam? Can we go talk? - Yeah. - I'm scared. Do I wanna have this conversation? - Gotta have it. - [inhales, exhales] - I don't like this, you know? I think it's best I just step away from both, you know? - Okay. - We all have to work on the same boat, and to be honest, going on a date with you tomorrow, I was, like, super excited, and then tonight you're quick to, like... - What happened with our conversation that we just had at the table? - Put me down. - Right. - I thought we figured it out. - Were you just lying the whole time, or... - Not lying, Adam, just taking a second to take it in, you know? - Well, now it seems like it. - I think Adam's super immature. We're not dating. I didn't cheat on you. It's not that I don't want to spend time with you-- - But you don't. You've made it pretty clear. - Okay. - Okay? - All right. - Good chat. I wish you the best. - Why are you--like, this isn't, like, a-- - 'Cause I really wanted you, and you're shutting me down, so... - I'm not shutting you down. I'm just saying, like-- - Yeah, you kind of are. - All right, let's call it that. - I've been on yachts for ten years, and I've avoided all relationships. Suddenly this little thing shows up and kind of changed things a little bit, and it's pretty clear to me that she's gonna make her own decisions at this point, so the smartest and easiest thing for me to do would be to walk away. [knocking] - Malia? - Yeah? - You're up, huh? - Yeah. - Heavy night? - Yeah, you think? - I'm so tired of all of this. - Well, just so you know, I'm not going on a date with Adam. - You all right? - Yeah, thanks. - Okay. - Why don't we get in the bath? No, no, no. - Me too. - Oh, I'm drenched. - It's so comfortable. I laid down, and I was like-- - Beats a cabin, like, top bunk with Bobby. [lightly edgy music] - Oh, dude. So just so we're on the same page, bro, I'm not gonna--we're not going out, just so you know. - We're not gonna go out tomorrow. I think we decided it's probably best just to, like, keep everything professional, you know what I mean? - Agreed, no, but just get that out of your brain, bro. - Yeah, 100%, 100%. - That's all you can do. - Do you get to stay in Split? - Tomorrow morning. - You're leaving? - Yeah. It's been nice to see what he's doing and meet everybody. - I'm glad you were able to come. - Mm-hmm. - The South African braai day, it's where you all come together and close down the roads and you share meat and stories and beer, and it's just all about being proudly South African. - Yeah, what are we cooking? - Sausages. We'll see what Chef Adam's got. I think it's coming to that stage in the season where we've been back to back, and we've had our dramas. We had our fights. Have a beer. Have some food. Just laugh about it and move on. - Hello, Bugs. - Hi, Bugsy! - Yeah? - If you wanted to come? - Yeah, it sounds good. - I was thinking of asking Bobs as well. - Yeah, ask Bobs. Let's just us four go and have fun. - Yeah, us four. - That sounds fun. ♪ ♪ - What are you drinking this morning? - Coffee. - Are you all right? Are we all right? - Yeah. I don't love it, but...you know. - You respect it. - I need Wes, Adam, and Hannah in the crew mess for a prep and sheet meeting. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi. - Hello. - So...primary charter guest, Lauren Kaufman, is the cofounder of Goza Tequila. - Okay. - She'll be bringing her best friend, Bobby, and his life partner, Joe. Joining them will be a married couple, Mark and Shauna, and power couple Brandy and Ricardo. - Nothing really food allergy- wise, which will be nice. - The primary guest would like to have a tequila pairing dinner on the last night? The guests are requesting a lot of water toys and water sports. They want the slide. - I see that. - Water ski, jet ski, slide. - Yeah. - All right, it looks good. Let's get back to work. - Let's do it. [electronic chime] [chime continues] - What the... Bobby? - Huh? - I want to talk to you quick. - Okay. - I want to speak to you. - What's going on? - I was, like, in the master cabin, and this thing was going off, and there's, like, all these text messages coming through. Go to the top. It seems to be from our primary guest. - Whose iPad is this? - It's the master iPad. - Remember his phone broke, so he must have logged in on his Apple ID on there and never logged out. - Oh, sh--. - This is a huge violation of yachtie code. Never get involved with a charter guest during charter. Don't do it. - [gasps] - I know. - I just want to kind of give you the heads up of what's going on. This charter guest that just left, Jason, he kind of kissed me. - I was in the master cabin, - I was in the master cabin, and this thing was going off, and there's, like, all these text messages coming through. They've been messaging since charter. - "Okay, so I make the drinks and you massage? Sounds fair to me." It's so f---ed up that she did this. I--I have no words. - Oh, this is like my little sanctuary out here. - It's so nice. - Jason found me on social media. - Ah! - It's just so uncomfortable 'cause, you know, I have such a strict policy that I don't get involved with guests. - Oh, yeah. Yup, yup. - But at the same time, he's just so f---ing cute. - He is cute. I would go for it. - Mm? - If there was a connection? I would. - If it's like you keep it professional when they're on the boat, and you obviously have a spark with them... - Right. - And then afterwards they message you with, like-- - You can't help who you have a connection with sometimes. - Yeah. - Even if a friendship comes out of it? - Wouldn't be a friend, trust me. [both laughing] - Oh, wait, now, this is today. - This is today. - "I will tell them I need to take a walk around. I'm sure it will be fine." [gasps] - I know. - Oh, I got to--I got to read all of this. Hold up. - Shh! [light music] ♪ ♪ - Whoo! - All righty. - How do I get down from here? - I'll just catch you. - Okay. - There you go. - All right. - Oh, hi. It takes a lot of work to look this good. - So cute! - What shoes am I gonna wear? I don't have shoes to wear. - [whispers] Hey, I got it. I want the crew to know that hey, Hannah's talking sh-- about all of us to the charter guest. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ This is cool. - This is awesome. - What are we drinking? - [indistinct] and tonic please. - I'll have a vodka soda lime. - I'll have a gin and tonic, then, please. So who's cooking the braai tonight? - I'm guessing it's gonna be Adam and Wes. - Wonder what they're gonna talk about. - Awkward. - Bro, come try to help us figure this out. - Braai day in full effect. I like that it's just an open grill though. That's cool. We should burn this boat down. Wes, to me at this point, doesn't feel like we're friends. It's kind of like degraded to small talk. It just proves that two men who are roommates can't go after the same woman. - Burn the boat down? - [laughs] We're gonna burn the boat down. [laughs] - Could I just see your iPad for a second? So remember how on our last charter our primary broke his phone in the hot tub? - Yeah. - Oh, sh--. - Is that--here, do you want me to put it in rice? - He logged in with his Apple ID on the master iPad. - He logged in to the boat's iPad, and he's texting Hannah. - Shut up. What? - It started at 12:30. - What, after the guys get off? - During the white party. - So it happened when we were on charter. - When I saw this, that's when I was like, "Whoa, this is f---ed up." That's not okay 'cause that makes us all look bad. - F--- off and get off the boat then. - Yeah, exactly. It's so much sh-- about other people. - Yeah. To me, Hannah can do whatever she wants with the charter guests. I don't care. What I care about is the fact that she's talking sh-- about our crew, and that sucks because we're supposed to trust you. - So next charter, right, if there's some chicks that are into you and then she starts to pull you up and be like, "Bro, you can't do this--" - No, but--no, but it's professionalism, Max, when you're working on a boat. - You know, if I were captain-- - I'm sorry. - I wouldn't care. - You don't cross that when you're working. - Well, if you do- - Shut it. - I won't tell her. - And they were talking about meeting up later. We've got to come up with some kind of prank. He says, "I'm walking by the boat now." She says, "I'm on the bow at the very front. [overlapping chatter] - I'm so jealous. - But I think it would be funny is if they met up tonight and-- - And we went out and meet them there. - And we went out. - Oh, hi, you guys. Pull up a table. [laughter, chatter] - Got everything? - Wait, how do we make sure this is on silent? - I got you. - Yo! - What's up? - Braai masters. - Now that everyone's back, should we light a fire up this barbecue? - Let's light it up. - Let's light it up, yo. - Actually, I'm just gonna go and have a little walk. - Okay. - Yeah. - You all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. All good. - Cool. - What's--what's this about? - This is the braai war paint. You want some war paint? - Yeah. - Super. There we go. That's dope. - That's dope? - [whispering] Let's go. Go, run, run. - Wes- - Two minutes. - We'll be right back. - Where are you guys going? - We'll be right back. - What? - She went this way. Oh, f---, my shoe's untied. - Come on. - Oh, wait, look who's over there. - Oh, sh--. - Go this way. Go this way. - Is Hannah there? - He's there--Jason's there. - But you didn't see Hannah though, right? - No. - F---. I wish I wasn't wearing this shirt right now. - You do stand out like a sore thumb. - I know! - F---ing put my jumper on, Bob. - I'm not gonna be able to hide from this. This is a horrible idea. Dude, this is kind of a sick getup. - Wes, I feel like I need to let you in on what's just happened. Bobby and I were in the master, and the master iPad was going ping, ping. It was a conversation between Hannah and our primary charter guest. - Oh, wow. - She's been trying to get off the boat to see him and stuff. I was saying it's very unprofessional. - I think the risky thing of this is that if she might think of it as, like, an invasion of her privacy. That's the only thing that I think could be touchy with the situation. - Yeah. - Oh, f---, she's on the other side. - She's there. She's there. She's there. - She already saw us. We f---ing blew it. - She's on a march, boy. Oh, she's turning in to the boat now. - Now--now this is obvious. - Hey. - What's up? - Nothin' much. - No? - How you guys doing? - Oh, I left my wallet in Olive Street, so-- - Then we had a little bromance chat. - Bobby needed a beer, so he's all, "Oh, I'll come with you," and-- - What blond and brunet? - This blond and brunet? - Yeah. - [laughs] Well, you know. - You want to join? - Hey, guys. - I'm starving. - Sour Patch Kids? - Yeah. What makes you think you're getting some of these? You know I got a secret stash, right? - Sour Patch Kids. - Oh, you really want some, do you? - Just the good flavors. - Hey. - Hey. What's up? - Nothing much. - You're all dressed up. You look cute. - This is, like, a sweatshirt, but thank you. - Look at that. - Smells delish. - Yeah, bro. - Oh, hey. - What's up? - Sandy! - I'm going to bed. - Are you joining in on the braai? - I'm good. Just take some photos, 'cause I would really like to see the whole experience recorded. - Aww. - You have your iPad, right? - Got the iPad. - Enjoy. - Well, should I order a pizza? - I can do this. This is about the only thing I can cook. - Can we just put it in the microwave? [upbeat music] - Oh, sh--, they're burning now. - Tank top and baggies. - Oh, damn, Bobby. Ooh. - Oh, damn, look at that. Get at it, you. - Do we have little forks? - Just use your fingers. - This is really good. - Nailed it. - I'm gonna kick to bed, guys. Got this flight in the morning. Enjoy the rest of your braai. - I hope we get to see you again soon. - So good to meet you. - Bobby, can I speak to you? I'm gonna tell her that we know about this. Too many people know now that if she finds out, it's not gonna turn out well. I really think that you and I need to go and speak to her and just sit her down and say, "Look, we found the messages." - She's gonna go mental. - This needs to be done, and it needs to be done tonight. We've got guests coming on, and this could potentially blow up into something way bigger than it needs to be. We're gonna tell her. - Yeah, I agree. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Hannah. - Hannah. - Huh? - Do you have a minute to chat? - Yeah. [suspenseful music] - Hannah. - Hannah. - Hannah. - Huh? - Do you have a minute to chat? - Yeah. - All right, listen. You might be a little upset with us. - And you--and you have every right to be. Bobs and I were in the master cabin today, and the master iPad was going off with messages, and I think Jason's phone is mirroring on it... and we saw a message saying he was at the bar. - That's why me and Max came to find you. - They were gonna come and speak to you... - We were gonna be like, "Oh, hey." We thought we were gonna find you with him, that it was gonna be a joke. And then it was, like, you were coming back, and we were like, "Oh, f---, joke ruined." - We just wanted to let you know. - Oh... To me, that's like such an invasion of privacy. Like, eight, nine hours of you reading my messages? Like, get a f---ing life. Text someone yourself. I've done nothing wrong, so... whatever. - Hannah's response is weird. Really bizarre response. - All right. - [indistinct], Han. - [sighs] Ahh... - I really like Hannah but, like, from one minute to the next she's, like, my best buddy, and then she's, like, all funny with me. - Like, imagine if Lauren was texting the primary-- - Or me, and-- - And Hannah found it. - Yeah. - She would lose her sh--. - Hello, Lauren. - Hi, how was the braai? - You missed out, girl. - I know. - It was fun though. - Cool. So what's up? - The primary had mirrored his phone to the iPad, so all his messages to Hannah were coming through, saying that, like, he wanted to meet up and stuff. - That sucks. - What sucks? - That her personal business is now the crew's business. - Yeah, well, I mean, if it's coming through on the master iPad... - I don't know. It is what it is. Those are personal messages that were not meant for anybody else's eyes, and everyone has access to them? I would freaking die. All right, guys, good night. - Night. - G'night. That's two insecure, shady girls teaming up. Like-- - So maybe tomorrow I'll just be like, "Look, Malia and I have discussed it, "and you and Lauren seem to be getting on really well, and maybe it's just best if you two live together." - I think they'd be a perfect match. - We'll let nature sort itself out. - Yeah. [laughing] [bright music] ♪ ♪ - What can we stir up today? - Another beautiful day. - So much in this bag... [murmurs]. - Why don't you just put it in your suitcase? - You have to uncover everything? - Oh, I don't know if I need my jersey or not. - Sweatshirt? Like, what do you call what you play sports in? - Sports jersey. [both laugh] - Lauren, I'm going. - Oh, my gosh, I'll miss you. I'm gonna come visit you. - Yes, please do. - Not Max, you. - I'm just doing the rounds. - I'm so gonna miss you. - I'm off. - Have a safe flight. - It was nice meeting you. - It was nice to meet you too. - I'll look after her, man. It's all right. - Bye. - Bye. - Keep smashing it. [indistinct response] - [laughs] Keep smashing it. Having Emily come on board is a massive incentive, you know, just to get my head down, work hard, get this charter season done, and just go home to her. - Here again. - Hellos and then good-byes and then hellos. - Hellos and then good-byes and then hellos. And then you'll be like, "Why don't you just go away?" - No. - "Go back to charter season." - You're not leaving me for a long time after that, okay? - All right, I'll see you later. - Stay positive, please. - I'll try. - Okay? - Positive vibes only, yeah? [edgy music] - I'm actually starting to realize how f---ed up this situation is. Like, it's a violation of my trust, and it's a violation of the trust I need to have in a second stew and the respect that she should have for me as a chief stew. Captain, Captain, Hannah, have you got two seconds for a chat? - Yes. [edgy music] - I don't know how I'm going to work with her, let alone trust her again. Do you mind if we talk in the master? - Not at all. - Thank you. I just want to kind of give you the heads up of what's going on about this charter guest that just left, Jason. We had kind of an instant connection. Obviously it's a charter guest, so I try and keep it professional while he's on board. On a late shift he pulled me aside up here and kissed me, and I did kiss him back for two seconds, and then I went, like-- - Wait a minute. It is not cool to respond if a charter guest hits on you. Wow. - He kind of messaged me on social media, and we were texting yesterday. - No matter what happens on charter, how many times a guest approach you, you cannot cross that line. I don't care who approaches you and wants to kiss you. You do not allow it to happen. You have to use your common sense. Maintain your professionalism. - Yeah. To make sure that this scenario doesn't happen again, I'm taking Hannah off the nights so the temptation is gone. - Thanks, Sandy. - Jesus Christ, what is it? - I was wondering if today it could be my day to take the boat off the dock. - Absolutely. - Let's do it. Well, the worst thing that could happen is we could crash the boat. [laughing] - I'm glad you asked, Bobby. Really. - Thank you. I'm glad you're giving me the opportunity. - Yeah. - Bugs, Bugs, Hannah, could you pop down to the main saloon for me? - Be there in one minute. - Okay, so I just had a chat with Sandy. I'm gonna swap you guys shifts. - Okay. - So she can do backup lunch service. - Cool. - In terms of yesterday, I would kind of expect you as my second and what I thought was my friend to just kind of come and tell me instead of spend the whole day with Bobby reading personal messages. To me, that's kind of a bit gross, but all good. - The iPad is the boat's property, so anything that is on there is open to the crew of the boat. What if it had been the charter guest after Jason's charter who'd come across these messages? This is a completely fireable offense. I do apologize, and that's why I came and spoke to you about it last night. - Yeah, but you didn't come to me and speak to me about it. You got Max and Bobby to come with you. - I do apologize, and that's why - I do apologize, and that's why I came and spoke to you about it last night. - Yeah, but you didn't come to me and speak to me about it. You got Max and Bobby to come with you, and it-- - Well, they wanted to be because they were involved in it, so I just thought it was right that we all come clean to you, and that was--that was it. - Okay, cool. - I was thinking that, because you and Lauren seem to be getting on really well, that maybe she'd move in with you. Might just ease everything about-- 'cause I can tell there's, like, sort of tension. [tense music] - Okay. - I'll chat to Malia as well. - Okay. - Thank you. - Lauren, Lauren, Hannah. Maybe I crossed the line, but at the same time, to do that sort of an invasion of privacy on a primary charter guest who's just left you a massive tip, that, to me, is disgusting. So I wanted to update you on a few things. - Okay. - Firstly, I'm gonna swap you and Bugs's shift. - Okay. - And, like, obviously the sh-- went down yesterday with the technology and the iPad and things like that, and I just had a chat with Bugs. I know where I stand now, which is chief f---ing stew and badass bitch, so if you want to play that game with me, I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to work, so we're thinking about maybe swapping, so you-- - Cabins? - Yeah. - You'll come in with me. - Really? - Yeah. [laughing] - Yes! - You look so-- - This is the best day ever. Everything about this room switch is working out in my favor. I don't have to room with Ronda Rousey anymore. I just want to know which one. - A lady never tells. - I like that. Respect. - Mm-mm. - All right. This is definitely gonna be a way for me to get closer with Hannah, and we'll be able to see each other more, really. - Just so you know, the charter guest, he pulled me aside in a corridor and kissed me. - Okay. - And I kissed him back for a few seconds, then I went, "Get professional, honey." - Yeah. - "Leave it till after charter." - I have your back. I mean, I had to pretty much, like, defend you last night in front of the two new roomies, so... - Why, what were they saying? - "Oh, that's so wrong. I can't believe that." - This is Malia? That's f---ing rich. - Yeah, right? - Ah, yes, you definitely shouldn't be texting with a charter guest, but making out with two crew members in the same night, oh, that's-- - That's totally on, you know? - Totally fine. - Bugs is moving in with Malia. - Why? - 'Cause everyone wants to sleep with me on this boat, if you haven't figured that out yet. [laughter] - We're all waiting, so don't get any on [murmurs]. - I'm not changing my f---ing roommate. - Uh-uh-uh. - All crew, all crew, let's get into our whites. - Get those dirty feet off my bed. - Maybe you should have the top. - Yea-eah. - Looking sharp, deck crew. - [giggles] - There's the boat. Are you excited? - I'm very, very excited. - Hi, guys! - Welcome. - Hi, I'm Sandy. - Hi, I'm Wes. [overlapping greetings] - I'm Mark. - Adam, pleasure to meet you. - You too. - Welcome aboard. - Welcome to "Sirocco." We're really happy to have you on board, and we can't wait to see your tequila. - I hope so. - We're very excited about it. - We'll work it out. - We're learning about it. So welcome. Hannah's gonna show you around. - Okay, thank you! - Great. - Cheers. - Right? - Wow. - Yeah, yeah. - So this is the main salon. - This is amazing. - The bar. all: Yes! - We'll just take the tequila out and leave the rest of the luggage. - A whole exercise area. - Yeah, you can sit in the hot tub, drink champagne, and watch him work out. [chatter, laughter] - This is the easiest luggage. None of them are my size. - This is the master. - Beautiful. - We can all fit in that bed. [laughter] - Deck crew, deck crew, let's get to our positions, please. - Oh, I love it when the deck crew get to their positions. - You're gonna take command. - Take over? Here we go. Yeah, we're good to go to pull lines. - All right, she's free. - You walk it off enough till Wes goes, "You're clear to swing." - I'm excited. [glasses clink] - We can put it straight in. I'll feed it to you. - Charcut-cut going in your mouth-mouth. - Bobby, all lines are clear, all lines are clear, free to move. - Am I going to one on each? - Got it? - Got it. I'm crazy nervous because there's charter guests on board. This little tiny switch is gonna operate this massive boat. Hopefully we won't be hitting the dock. - Are we taking off? - There's movement. - We got a female driver. [laughter] Here's what you're gonna do. We're gonna straighten it up, reverse. I'm watching my bow. I'm gonna pull it out of gear. I'm gonna thrust, go back into gear. - Wait, what? Got it. - Back into forward. You're going astern. - Bon voyage. - Bon voyage. - You just need a little more practice. - This one's not gonna fit. It's so big. - [laughs] That's what she said. No? - Let's kick off this trip, yeah? Tequila! all: Tequila! [upbeat music] - That's as pretty as Adam's eyes. Did you see his eyes? Holy crap. There he comes. - Ah, there he is. - Oh, speak of the devil. - I like to do this with the guests when they first come on board, just get a chance to kinda get to know you guys and what isn't on the preference sheet that you want to eat. - Cocoa Puffs! [laughter] - We have them. - Did you get them? - We have so many Cocoa Puffs, you're gonna burst. - The tea towel? - No, the tea towel, the backwards hat. - Backwards hat. - The apron, the Crocs. It's like, dude, come on. I've never seen a chef go in front of guests in what they cook in. It's not professional. - Your eyes are absolutely gorgeous. - Oh, I'm gonna go back in the galley now. - This might be pretty, but this is a hot mess. - Bam. ETA 30 minutes. - Yay, we didn't die. Thanks, Bobby. - What are we getting for lunch today? - I don't know, but I need my black hat back. It's my lucky hat, and it matches my apron. - You can have it. - [giggles] - Got it. - Oh, dang. What'd you do to it? - What'd I do to it? - Did you just sleep with it? It smells like you though. - Okay, don't excite yourself. - Never say no to champagne. It's just rude. ♪ ♪ - All right, Wes, drop the anchor. Four shackles. - Copy that. We've got four shackles at the water line. - Great. Good job, Wes. - Max, can I please get you up forward? - What's that? - He wants you up forward. You and him are doing the slide. - Wow. What, he's actually gonna leave Malia's side? - Smell it. - Smells like tequila. - It's not tequila. It smells like VeeV. - It's got a f---ing lobster on it. - Now I just want to get off this boat and go to Dallas. - No crew members going through your personal sh--. - Yeah. That's something I would do to someone I really don't like or that I want to screw over, you know? - Yeah, exactly, yeah. - Not, like, somebody I'm supposed to be friends with. I'm just feeling really over this crew because, you know what? We're all humans. We all make mistakes, but if they want to get at me, I'll just give it straight back because not one of them are perfect. Look, I'll just work with her. - Yeah. - I'm not gonna make her life easy like I did though. - Yeah. - I'm not gonna go out my way to make it hard. - Yeah. - [laughing] - Really nice attitude to carry yourself around with. - I think so. - People love it. - Oh, I'm really here to be loved. - Got the transom, yeah? - Got the transom, yeah? - Yep. There we go. - Look at this, all set and ready for fun. [engine revving] ♪ ♪ - Adam, do you think I can ask you a favor? - Nope. - No? - I don't like any sentence that starts with "favor." - Do you think maybe when you go and see guests, you can take your apron off? - No, hell, no. - Okay, what about the cap? - How about I'm gonna wear what the f--- I want to wear 'cause this is my galley. - Yeah, but you're not in your galley. You're in my interior. - Sorry, Charlie. I've been doing this too long to be taking orders from you. - I'm just suggesting maybe a more professional approach. - It hasn't slowed me down so far in my professional career. - I'm not asking him to go and put a f---ing tuxedo on. It's just ridiculous. - Get over it. You prance around like you're perfect, and you're not. You're not even close, okay? - That's right. I'm sorry. Every f---ing meeting it's the interior is f---ing perfect, and the chef's f---ing up, so... - I'm pretty sure there's only been a couple instances, so... and they were my intention. - Yeah, you intentionally f---ed up. That's so much better. - It is, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's what I thought. - Whenever you're ready with the lunch order, that'd be awesome. - So regardless, don't claim you got it down, 'kay? - I do have it down, and I'll claim whatever the f--- I want. - Really nice attitude to carry yourself around with. - I think so. - People love it. - Oh, I'm really here to be loved. - Yeah, you've already lost one roommate. You thinking to lose the next one? - No. - Seems to be working out great between us as a result as well. Smoothest chief stew-chef relationship I've ever had. - I really don't give a sh-- if you're sarcastic or if you don't like me, Adam. - You should give a sh-- about something. - I'm not here to keep the crew happy. I'm here to keep the guests happy. That's what I care about. - You've made that very clear. [edgy music] - Next time on "Below Deck Mediterranean"... - Pick up your f---ing sword and your armor and choose your f---ing side and go to war. - Oh, hell, yeah. - I'm done. - Works with luxury clients as a yacht broker. - I'm sure she will be looking at me under a microscope. - For dessert you have a watermelon mint granita with fresh lime. - Was this out of a box, or was it something whipped up? - I just think with, like, me and him and me and you, I just want things to be neutralized, kind of. - Why are you reading a primary charter guest's messages? - You shouldn't have f---ing necked him as well. - He kissed me. - Oh, right, it don't take two to tango? - I pushed him away. This is bullsh--. [kissing sounds] - I want you to pick a lead deckhand. - I don't know what to do. - Not a choice anymore.
