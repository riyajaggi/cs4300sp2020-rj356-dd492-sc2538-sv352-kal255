In my five years in yachting, I've never had anyone go to the captain about my service. You know that we've done, what, seven charters now, and every guest has always said, "She's always smiling. - "It doesn't matter what time." - That's me as a person. That's me as a chief stew, but I can only be pushed so far. To be honest, they're vulgar. - They're disgusting. - They're rude. - Do you want to stick Tiffany - and Julia more in front of 'em? - That's exactly - what I'm going to do. Okay, let's do that. - I'm kind of disappointed - in myself, to be honest. They should not be able to see - that I'm not - impressed with them. I can only be, like, pushed so far before it's gonna be apparent - that I'm getting - a little bit sick Of being treated like sháá. - I'm not gonna come down hard - on Hannah Because I'm sure it's a personality situation and really has very little to do with her level of service. - I'm... I'm sorry. - Okay. Okay. Thank you, Captain. Thank you. So we're staying here tonight, - and then we're gonna end - our trip in Santorini. Oh, my God, that's so awesome. This is our boat.

I think they went to the captain about me, so I'm gonna have to put you guys on service. - Oh, it's just a bit much, - isn't it? We're just all exhausted. - I mean, Ben just - gives assy comments. - And you're just like, - "Fáááing save it." - I'm trying to do my job - "just as much as you are." - There's no respect there. - No. - Do you know what I mean? - Yeah. I'm not really sure if Julia and Tiffany realize what it's like working so closely with Ben, but I am really worried that Julia's about to find out. - Group hug. - What a great thing - To wake up to in my brig. - Aww.

You can talk to him about it. - You can't just go to him - and be like, "Hey, let's test Danny out with the phone?" No. I'm over it. No one's ever here. - No one's come up here - since I've been sitting here. - Hi. - Ahh, there she is. - All right, what drinks - can I get you? - We thought you forgot - about us up here.

In England, kind of upper-crust people I would avoid. Jules has me completely wrong right now, and apparently, she's had me wrong for the last six weeks. It's all fair to say that I'm this arrogant twat, right, but at the same time, - do you think you might be - a little sensitive? - I might be and because - I'm extra tired now. - Normally... in - a normal situation... - Okay, so now you're taking - that out on me - And calling me arrogant and... - No, I didn't say "arrogant"... - Putting everyone down - because you're over tired. - No, but I didn't say - "arrogant," it's just... - Well, you just admitted - that you were over tired, So maybe you were overreacting.

I just don't feel right about what Jules thinks I am. My father is Patrick Robinson. He's written many best-selling novels. He is completely self-made. I used to play sports with Prince William and Harry. It was just ultra-privileged, but I didn't want to rest on my laurels - because that's not - how my dad was, And that's the reason I left England.

[sighs] I just want to go over this Jules thing, right? I... you know, she's clearly homesick, overworked, over stressed, - and I feel like it's - a little unfair for her To just blame me for being a posh southerner and my attitude towards her. I'm actually way more sensitive than people think, you know, and that actually affects me. I think she's just maybe not used to working with your type of personality. - I wasn't used - to it at the start. I adapted. Yeah, but it doesn't mean that I am the worst human that ever lived.

No, I was... I was fine. I'm fine. I think I'm just a little worn out, but... That thing with Julia just kind of upset me, to be honest. It touched a nerve? Yeah, it... it really hit home because that was, like, the reason why I left England. You know, even though we're privileged and well-educated, it's, like, actually working against me, you know, because people put you within that stigma of being a silver spoon brat or whatever, and I'm just everyday person with an accent.
