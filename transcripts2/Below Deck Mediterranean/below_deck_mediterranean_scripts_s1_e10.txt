Ooh, sh... - Kid needs to see a doctor - ASAP. - We've got to get him - off the boat. I'm gonna medevac him. [ship horn blares] [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ [lively music] Danny's back up at 103.5 or so. Ohh, f... - So I'm gonna get him - out of here. - Okay. - I'm gonna medevac him. - Nothing that we're giving him - is working. - We need to get some - professional medical attention And medication. - We're gonna need - to send somebody with him. - We're already down one - in the deck department, So that means we're gonna have to lose a stew. - At this point, - Jen would probably - Be our most expendable - person. - I think Bobby and I - could be able to handle it, - And if we need it, we can - always rely on Tiff. - Okay. - Sounds good to me. - Bobby and I - can get the job done Because we're the ones that can handle the lines - and know how to tie up - a cleat. - Okay. Let's go. - Cool. May I dine next to you? Yes. Please. It is - so gorgeous out. All right, here we go.

Being coworkers and not friends with Ben, it takes away from the fun side of the job, but at the same time, I feel like we almost need to strip it back to, like, the bare bones and rebuild from here. - Have a break, babe. - Just chill. [sighs] Jen, Jen. - Go for Jen. - Jen, can you meet me In the main salon? Copy that. Danny, - we got a boat coming - That's gonna take you - to Naxos. - It's gonna get you - admitted to a hospital - And see what's going on - with you, Get some fluids in you. [groans] Hey.

If it gets really, really bad, - if he does have to go - to Athens, - You're gonna be - his little escort. - And you will have to go - with him as well. I wouldn't worry - about that. It's a little insulting - that Bryan's sending me - to a sickly hospital To care for Danny. This is bullsh... This is grilled salmon with sesame. Perfect. Thank you. This is, uh, broccoli and wild rice. - Mmm! - Nice. A chopped Greek salad with avocado. All: Mmm!

My cell phone. Okay. ♪ ♪ Take care, Danny. Hope you feel better. I'm concerned about Danny, - just as I would be - for any crew member. We don't know what it is. If it's contagious, - he could pass it on - to the entire boat, - And then we'd be - completely crew-less. Well, that worked good. - Yeah, and the guests - don't even know about it. - Yeah. - That's very cool. ♪ ♪ Hannah, Hannah.

And tomorrow, they want a jeweler to come on and, uh, bring a selection of his, um, collection. At this stage, usually I have guests passed out everywhere.

This is really pretty. Very nice. Sold, my friend. I am terrible at butter balls. Can I try a butter ball? Bobby will just ace it. - I think he will. - That's the sad thing. - And then you'll - fall in love. - Really? - [laughs] - People have fallen in love - for less, love. - Are you kidding me? - Men and women can be friends. I don't know why we can't just put it to rest already. Relationships are fickle. ♪ ♪ [pebbles clattering] ♪ ♪ Aw, yeah. [hands slap loudly] - Oh! - That was a good one. - Oh, don't f... - With my silver. ♪ ♪ - Oh, my gosh. - Look at this. - Isn't that beautiful? - Beautiful. Wow! It's so awesome.

[chuckles] I try to keep it professional as possible. ♪ ♪ - But, yeah, it's a little bit, - let's say, awkward. How was your day at work? - Oh, God. - It was amazing. - I cleaned the whole house - for you. - Oh, did you? - I did. That's awesome. - I made your bed - in the master. [laughs] - I don't know what it is - about Ben. - I just want - to take care of him. He's a big old teddy bear. - God. You really know - how to spoil a guy. I do. - I normally - go for younger guys, But maybe that's why the past relationships have been failing. - I just need a big diamond - on this ring now. - Excuse me? - [mumbling] So, Captain Mark, tell us about your wife. [laughter] We just, um, had our 16th wedding anniversary. - Ah. - High five! - Whoo! - All right. - How long have - you been married? [quirky tuba music] Um... 16 years. Okay.

I think - it was all good. - Whatever, like... - You enjoyed it? - Yeah. - Oh, good. It was really good. Did she just ask how dinner was? - Okay. - All right...

[laughter] I hope Danny is okay, but it is a lot quieter here without him, - mainly because the whole crew - is not yelling at him. - I'm gonna have that stuck - in my head all day today.

Here we go again. - "All guests are - used to partying hard... - That they'll need a vacation - "from this vacation." I want to get in my bikini.

[laughing] I feel really bad because I wanted to help out, but I'm gonna be stuck in my room. ♪ ♪ Hey, Jen. Can you come down here? Kay. - Uh, I was in the middle - of something. Watch me do this. - In yachting, there's a right way - to do something And a wrong way to do something. This wraps in, and in the back of your left hand, push it up. Is this sinking in? Are you getting this, Jen? I, like, never do this knot. When Jen doesn't know how to tie a knot, her failure's my failure. Hey, Jen. Keep practicing. - I want to see you - improve on this. Whatever. What's your thoughts, and how does tip work when somebody's not here? - Well, he didn't work at all, - right? No. But he also had to endure an illness. I mean, he didn't even try. - I mean, if you're not here, - and you're not working, Probably shouldn't get tipped. - So, yeah, I mean, - you have a point. Definitely. Deck crew, let's raise the anchor and get underway. Copy that. ♪ ♪ This looks so good. This is really good. Orange juice is, like, my hangover cure. [laughs] With three shots. [laughter] Are you okay? All right, so there's been a bit of a debate on the boat as to whether you should get your tip or not. But as a friend and protector, I reckon you should forfeit your tip before the meeting, because that way you'll gain the respect of your coworkers, right? Just knowing that I may not be able to send money home is just, it's... it's not good. - I'm just, - I'm coming to you as a friend. - No, I appreciate that. - Okay, cool. Stay well. [upbeat music] I know, Cap'n, I'm funny-looking, huh? Captain? Mm-hmm? I recognize that, this charter, I have been very ill - and that caused more work unto - the crew members. Mm-hmm. And I'd like to forfeit my tip if there is any tip for me. And pass that along for the crew members. - I will take that under - advisement. Okay, thanks, Captain.

[laughter] Thank you! - Thank you so much. - Safe travels. - Thank you. - Bye. These women have definitely been my favorite charter, and I am so sad to see them walk off that passerelle. - I just want to grab them - and bring them back And keep them forever, honestly. Well, that was... that was the chillest charter ever. Hell yeah. - I want to keep them - for the whole season. I know. - All crew, - meet in the crew mess For the post-charter meeting. Thank you. - Hello. - Hey, Captain. Hey, gang. Captain! - I think we pretty much knocked - that one out of the park. And we did it a man down. - I think that more helped - than hindered. So well done, everybody. The moment of truth. - Danny came to me, - and he said that, - Because he didn't participate - actively in the charter, 'Cause he was sick, he didn't expect the gratuity. That's why this is divided 11 ways. This is our biggest tip that we've gotten so far. $20,000 US. [all exclaim] 18,000 euros. 1,630 euros each, which is 1,800 US each. - All right. - Whoa.

Here we go again. They will arrive before noon, and this is going to be a two-day charter. So we have Jesse and Katie "Bitter." Well, that would be two Ts, so it's probably "Biter." Hopefully they're not bitter. Todd and Barbara Stainbrook. That's an unfortunate name. Michael and Savannah Mothner. And then Cameron Johnson and Elise Biel. Notice that the guys are all called co-primaries. - I saw that. - Yeah. So they're all paying, right? I guess so. - This group has been friends - for years And share a mutual love for business and excitement. All guests are used to five-star service and expect that on this charter. Night one, they have requested a costume theme party on the yacht. Any ideas? - Venetian themed party. - Mm. - Would be cool. - That would be really cool. - I've been through - everything on the boat At this stage of the season, and I do know we have Venetian costumes. That's Venetian. It smells like cheese. - Everything smells of cheese - to you. It does! - So that's at least - one less thing to worry about. Now, how are we doing on the discussion of menus? - There's a... was that a problem - this last time around? - No, I think - we're getting there. We've... We're developing a system. - I guess that's what - I'm asking. - An hour before service, - right? Yeah, you write down the menu and give it us. You come up to me and write it down. - I would prefer you to write it - down and give it to us An hour before service. Aren't you're the one that wants it? - I'll come down and write it - if you want to. - I mean, it doesn't - really matter. - No. - No, it's fine. I'm going to appease Hannah by delivering a menu and then there's never gonna be an issue. With communication, so not only am I helping everyone, - but I'm kind of - covering myself too.

Something cool may come up as we're driving by on the yacht, - and it's like, that would be - great for Instagram. But you know what? If the captain wants my phone, then the captain shall have my phone. Thank you. So out of curiosity, - like, do you have - a good old-fashioned English name, or... Julia Louise d'Albert, which is French descent, from my mother's side. D'Albert? D'Albert Pusey. Oh. And the uneducated people would say "Pussy." - Well, it's a good job - I'm educated. Oh, there we go. - And I speak French, - so we're good. There we go. The first moment I met Ben, I knew he was privately educated - and from a very - well-to-do family. You know, it's obvious. When I finished up at Central Saint Martins, I went to the south of France - and learned French - for three months. So I cleaned the school, and they gave me free lessons. Shush. Yeah. So is that why you're such a good stew? What do you mean? Well, because you're good at cleaning. [both laughing] That's a bit derogatory, no?
