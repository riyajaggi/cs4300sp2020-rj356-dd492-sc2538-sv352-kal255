 - I'm on top of the world! - The Med is definitely the hub of yachting. - It's so exotic, and the water is beautiful. - The Med is the playground for the rich and the place that "it" people want to be seen. - We have Mykonos to the north, Santorini to the south. Ready to go now. - Go, go, go, go. - Every time we drop anchor, it'll be someplace different for them. - Oh, lock it down, lock it down.

 My ideal deckhand is the yes-man. - We have to win together, we have to lose together. Work hard, play harder. - That's the name of the game, Bobby. And I'm just ready to win. - Cheers. - On boats, everyone thinks their role is the most important. But obviously, it's the chief stews. It's very cute, guys. When we're on charter, it's perfect, or it's nothing. Off charter, I can shake my booty with the best of them. - Hey, Jen. - Oh! - A mangin--

 I have a reputation as a playboy. I'm 6'5, I've got a little bit of muscle, so a lot of people don't know that I'm a nerd. What the-- - I like "Star Trek" and "Star Wars" and '80s music. ♪ Bobby's got the bass to the bass to the bass ♪ ♪ To make it ♪ - Where are you from, Tiffany? - Uh, Jupiter, Florida. People are shocked that I'm a scientist, especially since I'm in yachting and not really using my degree. But then I can teach them how much blue whales ejaculate. - Whoo! - Every since I got into the industry, I've been kicking some butt. I've actually worked on Marc Anthony's boat. - Thank you. - I'm just offering five-star service. What the guests want, they receive. - He has got way more game than you do! - I'm the charter king, baby! Boom shakalaka! - I want to hear your best American accent. My last name is Julia d'Albert Pusey, but people like to pronounce it... I'm English, but I am not reserved. I mean, it's not like I'm a little flower wall, you know? Wallflower? Or is it flower wall? A wallflower--I'm not that. - What do you girls talk about in your room? You get those girly conversations? - We just have sex. - Oh, damn. - Being a female deckhand, they tend to not give you the hard responsibilities. - Jen, you got it? - I got it. With complete confidence, I say that I'm the most experienced. You can't compare me to the other guys on deck. - This is Ben. He is the man. - Cheers, everyone. Having trained in Europe and chartering in the Mediterranean, the guests are a little more demanding than in the Caribbean. And it's less of a dog and pony show. Can you stop using the word "entree"? - Well, we're in Europe, okay? - Don't use the word "entree" ever again. Being on a yacht is a volatile social climate. - Is something burning? - Holy sháá. - Danny's unconscious on the out deck. EMT's coming to examine him. - Okay, copy that. Bobby, you're here. - It's just crazy. I've never seen anything like it. - How's it going? - Very well, Mark Howard. - Lovely to meet you. - Nice to meet you, as well. - I am thoroughly excited to be here. I feel much more at home here. I trained in Italy, which is very similar to what we're getting here in Greece. Oh, this is all right. Since Motor Yacht "EROS," I have continued to cook, do catered events, and I think the older you get, the more knowledgeable you become. So in just have so much more to give. - We'll get, uh, chief stew down here to say hi. And I expect her at any time. - Hi. - Hello. - How are you? - Very well, how are you? - Good, I'm Hannah. - I'm Ben, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - How's it going? You're the chief stew? - I am. - Very cool. Where have you just come from? - I've come from south of France. The Mediterranean is a really familiar place for me. I've worked here for five years. I've been all over Corsica, Sardinia, the Amalfi Coast. It's really sad, actually, 'cause I'm at anchor in Corsica or something, and I sit there going like, "Ugh, fáááing Corsica again. Really?" - You speak French yet? Not very well. - Yeah. It does help to have pretty girls in the galley. Bit of eye candy walking around, you know? - Is the Captain on board? - I think he was the Captain. - Yeah? - I'm just kidding. Yeah, he is. - Nice to meet you. I'm Mark Howard. - Nice to meet you, too. - Welcome aboard. - Thank you very much. Good to be aboard. - So we do have our charter starting tomorrow around noon. - Really? To set up a boat with a brand-new crew and then pick up charter guests in a day-- it's just unheard of. - You girls are gonna be very busy today. - Okay. - There's not a lot on the boat. There's provisioning to be done. - Okay. - But you seem perfectly capable to just jump right into it. - Great. You should have at least a month before the guests are coming. Like, are you fáááing kidding me? I'm gonna go and have a quick look around. - Okay, please do. - Hello? Anyone? - Oh, my God. Whoa. - Hey, what's up? - Hey, how are you? - Bryan. - And what position are you? - Boatswain. - Very cool. - How old is this boat? My God. Look at this. - Maybe, like, 100 years old? - Yeah, right? When I first started yachting, I didn't know a porthole from a poop deck. I've worked my way up, 'cause I've worked hard. And I've gotten the respect of my superiors. And five years later, I'm actually captaining day charters on 60-foot yachts. - Pleasure meeting you. - Yeah, likewise, man. - Yeah. - Let's have fun, huh? - Are you my chief stew? - I'm your chief stew. - Yeah! Hi. - Okay, what do you want me to do? Is this clean or do--no. - No, strip. - Right, okay. - This is one Greek boat. It's, honest to God, one of the most hideous boats I've ever worked on. I was trained on the best yachts in the Mediterranean, but you got to work with what you've got. So we'll do our best, and hopefully the guests will be happy. - I don't want to be rude, but it's a little bit gaudy. - It's really gaudy. Oh, you just wait. - It's like Liberace's gone mad and vomited all over the boat. - Look at the vomiting swan. - Oh, my. It's bad. I don't even know what to say. I'm a little bit speechless, if we're honest. - All right, fááá. Let's do this. - Captain. - Well, hello! - How you doing? - Very well. You must be Bryan. - I'm Bryan. Bryan Kattenburg. - Nice to meet you. I've been a yacht captain for almost 30 years. I've chartered boats across the south Pacific and all over the Med and all over the Caribbean. Even though the responsibilities are immense, and sometimes it gets a little stressful, I really do love the job. We've got a Greek boatswain, who speaks English. But there's just not enough direct communication between the boatswain and me. And I've been looking through your CV, and I see you've got 100 ton U.S. Coast Guard license. - Yes, sir. - What I'd like to do is offer you the Chief Mate's position on the boat. - Is that right? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - This would be a probationary period. We do have our charter starting tomorrow around noon. So we've got a lot of work to do. Somebody's not doing their job the way that it should be done, then I'm gonna come to you. - Absolutely. I'm happy to accept the challenge. This is my first time managing a team this big on this caliber of a yacht. And I want the Captain to know 100% that I can be his guy to go to. To me, losing's not an option. - Okay. - All right. - Welcome aboard. - Thank you very much. - Aha. Mm. - And we haven't got the other Stew on yet, have we? - No. - Hi! Tiffany. - Hannah, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Julia. - Tiffany. - Lovely to meet you. - There's so much to do, so we're just trying to-- - Get a game plan? - Yeah. I love having great relationships with my stewardesses. I've been told that I'm very... patronizing in my tone. They kind of say to me, like, "Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot." I'm like, "Well, then, don't be a fáááing idiot and I won't talk to you like that," so... it's really simple. - Holy cow. This is a lot bigger than my other boat. I've been in the industry now for about six months. I sold everything that I owned, bought a Greyhound bus ticket, and I moved down to Fort Lauderdale to get on yachts, and my goal was to travel the world while getting paid for it. And I'm doing it, man. - Crew mess. Laundry. We're gonna need to, like, attack your cabin with Febreze. It stinks. - Okay, this is awesome, man. - Bobby's definitely my type. - Do I need to get my polo and shorts or anything? - Uh, uniform hasn't arrived. Seriously, it's getting hot in here. - Thanks a lot. - My pleasure. - Holy crap, you're my roommate, man. - Oh, hell yeah! That's right. That's what I'm talking about. - All right. - Cool, man. Dang, you're one big guy, man. You take up the whole room. - For the last, uh, about ten years, I've been a firefighter in central Florida. When I was a kid, I saw "Ghostbusters," as I got older, I joked, "I'm gonna be a fireman so I can pretend I'm a Ghostbuster." Now I work for the fire department, so who you gonna call? 911? - I feel like I got to wait in line just to go to my room. - Uniforms are here. - Oh, uniforms are here. - Uniforms! - Thanks. - Do you like the top bunk, or do you have a preference? - I think so, yeah. - Okay, cool. - Guys, we got a meeting right now. - All right, cool. - When's the meeting? Where is it? - I don't know. Just follow us, I guess. - Hi, everyone. Um, we're going to introduce, um, three of our most valuable crew members. They are all Greek seamen. This is Costas, our Chief Engineer. Yannas, our Second Officer, and Niko, one of our deckhands. This is a brand-new crew for me. So I'm gonna be extremely hands-on, especially right up front. There is no room for error. People are paying big money to be on this yacht. First thing we're really gonna need to do, because we all are so new with each other, is make sure that we've got great communications with each other. If we think that we've got guests the next deck up, and all of a sudden, one of the guys takes off and the tender, oh, we've got to run back top the-- because somebody, uh--we could, we forgot-- um, let's make them feel--they're making us feel at home, let's make them feel at home. - Captain Mark is... he's a little odd. You know? Like, that would be fair. But all captains are strange. A life at sea will do that to you. I don't know. I don't want to be rude about it. - Good enough? - All right. - Enough said? Okay. - Perfect. - Get back to work. - Hey, guys, we've got provisions here. If anyone want to come out and help me, I'll start loading it on the boat. - Copy that, Danny. - We got some cigars. - Toothpaste, too. - Is that peanut butter? - That's enough for a couple of charters, surely. - Oh, my God. This doesn't look overwhelming at all. Oh, guys, I'm so sorry, we're really busy at the moment. And if you could just go as fast as you possibly can. - We'll do this right now, Hannah. Can you immediately get those wines into the closet right over here? The exterior of the yacht is in much better shape than the interior, and at the end of the day, the "Ionian Princess" crew is one big team. And if Hannah and the girls need help on the inside, we're there for them. - It's like ground beef. - Eggplant. It's a little oily. - Gross. - I'm done. - I don't want any of that. - You're gonna see it every time you walk by it now. - I-I just can't even believe you'd have that on a boat. - All I see is dick. - All right, guys. Let's just have a quick deck meeting. How long have you worked on yachts? - On and off for seven years. - Oh, wow. Well, that's longer than all of us combined, probably. - I consider myself an overachiever without the discipline. I tried out med school for a year and it's too suffocating, so I went into yachting because I love boats, I love being on the water, and I look good in khakis. - You know, I'm the guy that you guys are gonna be taking orders from. If I give a order, just follow it, you know? Don't sit there and give me a bad look, just--let's just get after it, you know? I mean, I don't want to be a dick, and, uh... that's it. - All right. - Sounds good, let's do it. - All stews, all stews, stop down and meet me super quickly on the bridge deck aft, please. Okay. So I wasn't sure about your experience and your background. - So I've done three seasons. Full-on charters back-to-back, so I'm kind of used to that. - I'm not super detail oriented. Um... I just got off a boat--I was on there for a year as deck stew. I did have to play stew a few times. I went to Florida Atlantic University and I have a degree in marine biology. I was working on a dredge boat for 35 days straight. I was in three different winter storms, and I had enough. I've been yachting for about a year and a half now. I really want to become a Captain one day. And I just think it's really important to know the ins and outs of every department. So if that means I have to be a third stew, then that's what I'll do. - Do you enjoy the deck work more, or...? - Oh, absolutely. - Yeah? Okay. - I need my vitamin D. - Well, now you're inside, so... We have less than 24 hours to get a 50-meter yacht ready for charter, and we just don't have time for somebody who doesn't want to be here. Why would you accept a position that you don't want? I'm really direct and I can't handle the rolling of the eyes, slamming doors attitude. You're gonna go to bed eight hours before you get up. - Okay. - My thing, which I've always had on boats, is hair up. I wash the towels on 90 degrees. - I love this! I feel like I'm in good hands. - Back to work. We have so much to do. - Hmm. - All right, put us to work. - Um, okay. do you mind doing stew stuff? - I can do anything, it's fine. - Okay, start in the guest cabins doing like a dust/vac. - Usually, I wouldn't be thrilled about dusting or doing the interior, but since Hannah is so cute, I will do anything she says. - Okay, so let's do this. This is veggies. Try and do this-- just like deli down there. - You all right? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yup. - How's your dusting skills coming along? - Well... - It's hardly being on deck, is it? So where are you from? - I'm from New York. Where are you from? - Leeds. U.K. For the last two years, I've had my own fashion label. I've shown in Paris twice, I've got it selling in shops. But the problem is, the money wasn't coming in as fast as I'd like it. So working on the yacht's just a great opportunity to put some money back in your pocket and do the passion that you want. So on deck, there's you... Bobby. - Big Boggy, yeah. - "Big Bob." - Little Daniel. - "Little"--Pocket Rocket, we've named him. "Pocket Rocket"? - In America, pocket rocket is, like a vibrator for girls. - Oh, no, no, no, we don't-- we're not meaning this. I've heard of the vamping rabbit or something, but not the pocket rocket. And I'm like, "Well, how do you know?" I'm like, "Oh." - Do you have a boyfriend back home? - Yeah, I do. I've been with him for two years. - So you're not tempted by any of the guys here? - No, not really my type. And you? When you're not working with the boys? - I don't like boys. - You don't--oh! Okay, I get it. Any nice girls on board? - To be honest, all of you. - Oh, really? Hannah looks identical to Jennifer Lawrence from "The Hunger Games" except with giant boobs and a bigger ass. If anyone is gonna hook up, I would hook up with her. So the guys have, like, no chance. Half of us are gay or taken. - It's one thing after the other, man. - That's what happens why you arrive on a boat a day before a charter. - Yeah, right? - I don't know if there's anymore room in the bilge. - Hannah, Hannah, Tiff. - Go ahead. - Did you want any of these flowers in the guest cabins? - Absolutely fine by me. - Have you, um, done the floors in the bathroom? - Just go ahead, then, with a cloth and, um, alcohol spray. Super quickly. I was a high school dropout and I was told by a lot of people that I wasn't ever gonna amount to anything, so my first season on a yacht, I worked my ass off and got my first chief stew job at the start of my second season. - Just needs downstairs, not the rest? - The whole boat needs, like, the vacuum and wipe, so... It's because of this, I have really high standards and really high expectations of both myself and my girls. Fááá. - Hannah, Ben, and Bryan, could you please come up to the bridge? - Copy that. - Ugh. Pretty tight in here, isn't it? - Oh, what a gentleman. - I have my moments. - Our primary is Christine Bullock. - Holy smokes. - All right. - Is she real? Is that, liken a real person? - Along with her husband, and then two other married couples. Christine is a health-conscious person that just launched a skincare product line. - All of them, it's like, "See Christine Bullock's preferences." - Whatever Christine wants to eat is fine with us. - It's a little cult. - We're here to please the "primary," which is Christine. You're on our boat. We are gonna make this your dream vacation. And I will cook for 24 hours straight until you are happy. - Special dessert that incorporates the ingredients of their organic skincare line. - What are they-- what does that mean? You gonna throw it in there, or-- - No, you just cook the flavors in. Like, here and there. You know? - Oh. - They don't want it to be made out of, like, lotion. - So it's not like squeezing bottles of face solution in there? - That's why I'm on deck. - We're glad you're here. - Yeah, yeah, it's good thing I'm here. - They are big Steelers fans from what we understand, so they watch a three-hour football game starting at 3:00 a.m. - They must really love football. - Their one big request is a Steelers game. But if I can manage to find ten hookers for my bosses on other yachts, then I can probably manage to stream a game. Cool. - Sweet. - Okay, thank you, guys. - Cheers. - Thanks, Captain. - Oh, sááá. This thing, not even high enough. Or stay. - Well, your head is on the ceiling. - I'm gonna have a whisk. Are you? - No. - Yeah, I'm just like, "Yeah, yeah." - It's good to be that quick at work. - I'm with you. - Fááá. - So I'm lucky I've got, um, Julia. She's really strong and-- - Yeah, it'll be fine. - It's only the beginning of the season, but I think me and Ben are gonna have a great relationship. We already have good chemistry. And having Ben in my face all day, that's not such a bad thing. - Well, that helps. - Do you like the colors for these bed sheets? - Yes. So nautical. - This is just absolute fáááing mayhem. - We got 20 minutes, yeah? - Correct. Exactly 20 minutes. - Okay. - Flight epaulets. No ties, black pants. - Okay. - All right, last one. - There you go. - Yay! - Good job! - I love this. This is great. You've done a miraculous job in less than 24 hours. Okay, go get changed. - This is so big! - Bring it up to the galley and I'll cut it in half. - Bobby, do I have to tuck these in? - Uh, I believe so. - All crew, guests will be arriving in five minutes. - Do you mind if we open it real quick? - Yeah. - I try and hide my emotions, but I'm pretty scared right now. Like, putting all these people together and having guests on 24 hours later--it's insane! - The charter guests are coming, guys. - And that's why I love it, 'cause I'm insane. - It's gorgeous, guys! Look at it. - I can't wait to get on that boat. - Okay, here we go. - It was one of our non-negotiables for this, was to have it on. - Excuse me. It's an American football game. - We're not gonna be able to stream it. - Sháá - And here we go. - Ah, this is exciting. - Are you guys ready for this? - Only one way to find out. - Hi! - Hi. - Hi, I'm Mark, your Captain. - Christine, nice to meet you. - This is Bryan, our Chief Officer. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Hannah, Chief Stew. - Bob, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Mark Howard. - Hi, guys, why don't you grab yourself a champagne, as well? - Thank you, I definitely will. - We'd like to welcome you aboard the "Ionian Princess." Hannah's gonna give you a little bit of an introduction to the yacht. And we'll get you taken care of. - Hi, guys, I'm gonna take you on a little tour around the boat and show you what you've got planned for the next few days. In my five years of yachting, I haven't had any bad feedback from my guests. I do everything in my power to make sure that their experience is as good as it possibly can be. And this is the main saloon. - This is beautiful. - This is, like, the formal living room that nobody ever uses and everybody stays in the den. - This is the upper saloon. - I see the men snoring here. - Yeah, this is where I'll watch the football game. - We have the master suite here. - Oh, this is beautiful in here. - Oh, good. You've got two bathrooms there, which is nice. - I love this marble. It matches our skincare brand. - Perfect! - Yeah. - Bryan, Bryan. We are good to go. Unfurl the gateway. - Copy that. Uh, no. Okay, out of the way. Bobby, get down there, buddy. - Jen's the first female I've ever worked with on the exterior. Guys, you can kind of yell, swear, punch them in the arm and move on. But with a girl, it's gonna be different, so this is gonna be a challenge for me. - Once everybody's in position, let me know. - One's in position. - Standing by at three. - Let's do this. - Okay, Captain, on your call. - One and four are first. Okay, go ahead and drop them. Let's go. - Okay, your stern lines are clear. - Slack that off. - Number one, all the way forward. - Go ahead so you can get that off. - Give him slack. - Three is clear. - Okay, Cap, all lines are free, all lines are free. Okay, the dock is mid-ship. Good, wide open back here. Good job, guys. - Wow, it's, like, 90 degrees in here. - Stew face! - Well, I'll help you with the dishes, and if you want me to fold anything, I got you. - Um, yeah, I need those rags--or, these rags. - I was just being polite! I didn't think you'd take my offer. - Jen, how are the guests? - Half of them are hot, half of them are guys. I should sub in for you and you can go outside. - Yes! Oh, my God, that would be amazing. Can we? - That's only something I would do for someone I was dating. - Aw! - I'm sorry. - I'll go gay for you. I'll go gay to be outside. - Okay, so for this guy, I think I'm just gonna feed it to you. - Okay, then, uh-- - How's it coming in there to you? - It's looking pretty, man. - Okay. - You're single, right? - Yup, hell yeah. - What do you think about the girl situation on the boat? - Fáááing fantastic. - Yeah, I know. I like Julia. She's got that, like-- I call her a unicorn. That brunette and blue eye combination? - Oh, yeah. - Dude, that's a hard find, man. - She's such a babe. And the accent? I mean, even if she got mad at you and yelled at you, you'd be like... - I know, right? - "You're just adorable." My last girlfriend, we dated for about three years. I was gonna ask her to marry me. We had a bad breakup. And being in a small town, I was constantly reminded of her. And I needed to get away. It really makes the day go by quicker when, uh, you got a cute face to stare at. I've worked on boats with some heifers. - Really? - It sucks. - Oh, guys, it's gorgeous. Hi, Ben! - How are you? - Good, how are you doing? - Good, thank you. - You're my main man. - I got that, and I was impressed with your, um... - I'm an integrative nutritionist. And I happen to know that in this district, you're gonna be okay with the gluten. So, I mean, if you just want to roll with it, or I can just keep to your plan. - Okay. - It's part of my job to challenge my clients' palates, because it's an amazing experience trying new things. I just hope these guys feel the same way. You're safe--I make everything from scratch, so... - Thank you. - Cheers, guys. Thank you. - Okay, Captain, we're all up. Ready on the port anchor, let us know when you're ready for us to drop. - Go ahead and let it run free. - Dropping anchor. You guys feeling it? - Yup. - All right, here we go. Somebody need to kick it? - Yeah. - If you're asking, it'll be obvious. - Yeah, give it a kick. - Come on, strong man, go nuts. Oh! - Chain's looking good. Looking tight and holding. - Oh, that was awesome. That makes your butt sting, man. - That girl is fine. She is hot! And fit. So fit. - Hey, guys, can we just have one person down on the swing platform, just to look after the guests? Hand 'em towels if they come up? - Whoo! Fááá. - Oh, that looks delicious. - So this is blueberry, basil, lemon juice, and vodka. - Yeah! Mmm. - Bobby, Jen, we got another jet ski coming overboard right now. Bobby, you down there, ready to go? - Yup, I'm down here. - Anybody been on the WaveRunners yet? - Not yet, they're about--yeah. - Tomorrow we've got reservations for lunch and all that. - Oh, my God. Fááá. - All right? - Nice. - Hello. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Good. - Have you ever streamed any football matches on this boat? - No, I haven't. I've seen some U.S. volleyball games and stuff on it. - After the hideous day yesterday with our provisioning, I thought streaming the game would be the easy part. Let me have a look to see if we could possibly get it on the TV. - Good luck. - Tennis, sailing, cycling, swimming, motor sports, boxing. Come on. This is bullsááá. Trying to facilitate a football game on a yacht is gonna be very interesting. We're not on land, we're not attached to cables, but guests just don't understand. Fááá. - You've got, like, short-shorts on, he's got granddad shorts on. - How are these shorts supposed to be? How do they do it? Are they supposed to be like this? - Ew! - I got to shift that. - I don't like that! Please. - Look at your ass. Can you walk? - You can see your balls. Put them away. - Hello. - I did. - Oh, you did? - It's what I've been doing. - Oh, any luck? No! It was one of our non-negotiables for this, was to have it on. - I know exactly what he's saying. Our tip's at risk unless the game is aired. - Go, go, go, go, go. Come on! Hello. - Hi. - Oops. Oh, no. Get the brandy! - Do you mind if I have your menu for tonight? - I don't mind at all. Saganaki. - What's saganaki? - Oh, I'm glad you asked. It's basically lightly-battered and fried Greek cheese. I've never done it before, and it involves quite a high flamee. - Degree of risk? - Yeah. It's quite a high-risk dish. - So it's either going to go really well, or you're gonna set the charter guests on fire. - Pretty much, yeah, yeah. It could really--yeah. - I have faith in you. And then main is moussaka? - Yeah. Moussaka's a wicked dish. It's very Greek. Ground lamb, browned eggplant, cinnamon, and tomato, and mozzarella. I might actually need your help. - You're a sous chef. - There you go. - Oh, this is a DVI plug. Digital video intercourse-- or interface. To be able to watch a US football game in the middle of the Med, where we have no way of actually doing that, we're concerned. - Well, it did say HDMI auxiliary on the TV. Do you have a computer, Bobby, with an HDMI cable? - No, I just have my iPad. - Your table looks awesome, babe. - Does it look all right? Good. - Yeah, it looks great. - All right, Bobby. I wanted to do some docking with you. - Cool, man. - You ready to try? - Yeah. - So, like, come in with some speed, and then you hit reverse. Try to get as close as you can, and I'll let you know. I want my team to know as much as I do. By doing that, it's gonna make my job easier because we're just gonna flow better as a machine. If you go a little faster, come in at a steeper angle. - Okay. - Do it again. - As the most experienced deckhand, I definitely see myself not being favored. It's a little sexist, and I see where this is going real fast. - Boom. - Boom, that was perfect. - Pick your side, TJR? - It's cooler down here. - How are you doing, Munchkin? - Good. - You staying out of trouble? - No. - Good. That's what I like about you. ♪ I need a beverage ♪ ♪ For my glass is empty ♪ - I'm gonna drink 31, which is gonna be the score of the game. - I'd be okay with that-- have a shootout like that. - That would be a good game. That would be. - What do we have for the first course today? - We have like a local cheese fried in Brandy. - Wow. - Do you drive? - Got a 1964 Vespa. - Huh, that's too cool. - Get in and run. - Sorry, did you guys copy that? - I'm gonna get a Vespa. - And Hannah? - I bet you look pretty cool on that, then. - I love it. - Are you not hearing this? - Sorry, it keeps-- I've got it, go on. - Where's his radio? - We've got--what do you want? - Ben, have you got a radio yet? - Yeah, I do, I just can't hear it. - All guests are seated. - Oh, they're seated? - Yeah, gonna do water, wine, bread. I'll stretch it out a little bit. - Have I got a problem with this? - You were talking a bit, so I was, like, distracted. - All right, here we go. This cheese has got an amazing aroma. All right, let's do it quickly. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Come on. - Oh! - Hey, guys, here we go. - Yeah! - Hello. - All right. - Oop--oh, no. Get the Brandy. All right, move, move. Move. - Yeah! - Oh! - Oh, my God. - Here we go. - Awesome. I'm glad you're getting your fitness in. Hell yeah. I was legging it, that's why. - Bon appetito. - Oh, man, it's all soft. - It's, like, fancy. - It's what? - Oh, wow. - This is so good. I have a degree in marine biology. Like, I don't want to clean up toilets and semen for a living. I'd rather be outside cleaning up bird sháá. At least it's biological. Yay. - You guys are the morning crew right here. I want you up at 6:00. - 6:00? - Yeah. I'm getting up at 8:00. Do you have the list from yesterday? - No, but I don't need it. I got it. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Hit the deck, too. Look for those salt spots. - Hey, man, I got you, brother. - Go to bed, guys. - Good talk. - Success? - Success. And this is moussaka? - Correct. Let's just truck 'em out, two at a time, please, girls. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, my goodness. - Wow, look at that. - What is this? - For the main course, you have moussaka. - Which is? - It's like a Greek-- a traditional Greek dish. It's like, ground beef, grilled vegetables...baked. Think it's got a cheese on top, if I recall correctly. - Yeah. - Oh, that's an eggplant. - All right, good night. - How you doing? - Good, going to bed. - Are you going to bed? - Good night. - You don't fáááing tell your Chief Stew that you're off to bed. - I know you like eggplant and beef. - It's all oily. Eggplant and grease. Gross. - I am done. I don't want any of that. - Okay, sure, it's a very heavy dish. Are you done, as well? - I am. - Just so far. - I want some raw veggies. I feel--I feel heavy. - Wait, what? - What's happening? They don't like it, or what? - No, they said it's very heavy. - I like to eat lean, as well. When I'm in Greece, I don't care if I have to run an extra half-mile, one day. I want moussaka in Greece. That's what I like. - So they were like, "Oh, so, what is this?" And I was like, "Oh, it's grilled vegetables, "beef, with some cheese on top. Sure, let's go with that." - I'm the best part of this side of Greece. - Yay. - Where do you want me to put the finished stuff? - Okay, on that tray there. - This tray? - Okay, let's just get the explanations right, okay, a little bit. You say, "Oh, it's vegetables and beef, looks like there's cheese on top," they're not--you're not selling it, 'cause they're like, "Well, what the fááá is it?" It's eggplant and lamb. If you tell them it's vegetables and beef, and it's white in a bowl, I'm not gonna want that, either. - Do you mind, maybe, we can, like, have a bit more structure around that? - We can drop it, but that's something we could improve on. Both of us. All right? I can improve on your-- on tuition, and you can improve on, I guess, learning. - It seems that Ben has a real issue with taking any responsibility for something that he's done wrong. I know I wasn't in the wrong. Fáááing hell. - It's a little ridiculous. - Where you been, girl? You were supposed to be on deck at 6:00. - No one's gonna find out about this, 'cause if they do, there'll be hell to pay. - Jen, were you up on deck at 6:00? - Captain? - Hey, Bryan. I just wanted to go over what we're doing tomorrow. - I'll get your dessert ready, okay? - Thank you. - These guests would like me to incorporate the skin care line into their dessert. All right, I need an ice cream bowl-a. So we're always gonna cross obstacles. But you can always make amends. That is the great part of chartering. You ready for this, big guy? - Ready, let's do it. - All right. - Now, I need to go up and explain it. - Thank you. - Hello, guys. - Hey! - How are you? - Tell us what you put in here. - I wanted to incorporate the flavors of your skin care line, and right here we have a green tea panna cotta, coconut caramel, and coffee ice cream. - Hey, Ben, thank you so much. - Oh, well thank you. - Yeah, thank you, guys. Yeah, you know, I couldn't have done it without Hannah...or Julia. - Yeah! - All right, cheers. - I like the panna cotta. It's awesome. - Just a little bit more water. - Green tea's good. - Oh, my God, this is fáááing fantastic. - Yeah, this is amazing. - Mmm. - How'd you sleep? All right? No. Oh, really? - Yeah. - I've been sleeping really well; I hate to say it. - Come on, Jen. Where you at, girl? Supposed to be on deck at 6:00. - Want a coffee, love? What do you want? Almond milk latte? - Yeah. - Good. I've been stuck in the laundry room, so I have no idea where anything is. Oh, I think this is it. - You sure? - Do you want me to pour this in there with that? Or on top? - Uh, I worked at Panera. - Oh, okay. - In my household, I am the father figure, and my sisters are the one that look up to me. My demeanor when I work on boats is to work really hard for my mates to show 'em that my work ethic is really good. - Oh, áááá. - Ugh. Dude, where have you been, girl? It's like 6:40. You're supposed to be on deck at 6:00, and we have a whole list to do that we got to get done before Bryan gets up. - I think it's ungodly that I was chosen to wake up at 6:00 a.m. If the task is completed, it's completed; it doesn't matter what time I'm going to the bathroom or where I am. Are you going to say anything? - For being late? He's gonna ask me why most of the stuff didn't get done. - I guarantee you he's not. - I won't bring it up. I'm not here to be lying to people. Look, if you make a mistake, just own up to it. If he doesn't ask-- - He won't. - I won't bring it up. - No one's going to find out about this. If they do, there'll be hell to pay. - Morning. Good morning. Um, cushions are on. What else did you guys do? - Did the cushions. I brought the boat line to the front, and then she's doing the sea spots and-- - Did you guys hit all this already? - No, I've been upstairs doing the cushions and everything. - Um... When I was a deckhand, when my superior told me to do something, I did it as fast as I could and as well as I could. It's challenging for me to have to manage a team that lacks the ambition and drive that I have. When you get a chance, let's crack on the radios. - All right, cool. - Yeah. We all on the same page with tonight's game plan for the game? - We're not going to be able to stream it. They really, really want to watch it, so if we have to get up-- - He's told me he's not missed a game in, like, all these years. - I know; that's what I mean. - Well, you know, there could very well be, you know, an English pub there. - I'm going to go into town and try and find someone that I can throw some money at and get this game aired at 3:00 a.m. - What is this? - Sounds very authentic. - Dude, I'm starving. - This is ready? - Let's start rolling with this. - Oh, it is the frittata. - Looks like a giant pizza. - Egg pizza. - Yay. - Good morning. - Ooh, we have food? - Look at this. - You got a frittata here. - This is so good. - So good. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God, this is so good. This was worth the wait. - All crew, just getting ready to depart. - So I'll get everything cleared away and then start backing in. - Okay. - So you're getting off and... - Going to try and find somebody I can pay to open a bar that happens to have an American channel on. - I think the stress is getting to Hannah. Me, trying to hide distress comes from, you know, I used to do acrobatics from the age of 7 to 14. So you have to kind of put this whole front on. You can't laugh. You have stand there so straight. So I think it comes from that, where I can kind of hide the stress. - You'll be missed, Hannah. - Have fun, Hannah. - How did you guys sleep, by the way? - I slept good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You guys were up on deck at 6:00? Both you and Jen? - Mm. - Tell me. No, uh... Yo, snitches, they get stitches, and I don't want to snitch. I don't want to be that guy. - Okay, I'll ask Jen. Hey, were you up on deck at 6:00? - Hey, were you up on deck at 6:00? - Just a few minutes after. Like, five, ten minutes. - I'm annoyed. She should be doing her job, and more importantly, respecting me and respecting her position on this boat. Wake up and get the job done. 6:00 on deck means it's 6:00 and you're ready to work. Let's not let this happen again, all right? I'll be back. - I didn't say anything. - Are you not familiar with the concept of lying? - I don't really like to lie, but I didn't snitch. - Apparently Daniel has morals and doesn't feel comfortable lying. I don't know how he gets through life. - This cereal sucks. - Guys, enjoy your meal. - Bon appetit. - Thanks, Hannah. - Hi. I'm hoping you can help me. Is there, like, American pubs? - Straight ahead two minutes, the church, uh, behind the church. - Behind the church. Okay, great. Thank you. Could you just tell me the area where I can find some bars? - No, sorry, not the bus. Like, bars for drinking. - I've never missed a Steeler game, period. - You've never missed a single Steelers game? - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. It's an American football game. - I am so stressed. If I fail, then the whole crew pays for it. I'm freaking out. - This season on "Below Mediterranean"... - Welcome to Greece! - What the fááá is that? - More martini, less espresso. - Living on this superyacht, the guests get exactly what they want when they want it. - Whoo! - Ten more seconds of whatever you got. - Five-star treatment means holding someone's hair extensions and wrapping them up in a napkin. With a smile. - Hannah's looking for some loving. She pretty much wanted to bang last night. Oh, my God! - Cupid is going crazy. - She just touched my butthole. Oh! - You have a crush on my stew, that's true, yeah? - She's the one that started the flirting. - Don't fááá with her. - I could kiss you right now. Is that inappropriate? - Absolutely. We're here to serve them, entertain them. We're not here to connect with them. - A yacht is a political arena. What was the "entrée" tonight? - I got confused when a piece of fáááing bread with salmon went out as the fáááing starter. - This time I will have no allies. Don't throw me under the bus. - You're fáááing up at work and then you're walking down the street sculling out of a bottle of wine. - Can't fáááing please her. - If you can't tie a bowline-- - Any idiot can tie a bowline if they just read the book. - She's out of her element. She's not bonding with anybody. - His line is ripping. - Oh, sááá, sááá, sááá. Bobby, what's going on? Lock that line on! - So you think he'll be fired? - Yeah, I think so. - Get the fááá away from me. - You've lost my trust... - Shut your face! - You've lost the respect of your crewmembers. - Can't believe I'm fáááing crying. - Back your bags. You can collect your tip money and your plane tickets and go home. For more information on
