 Oh, that's terrific. Bruce Bowen, if you win tonight, what charity will receive $10,000? My foundation. The Bruce Bowen Foundation. It's an educational organization dedicated to transforming US public education for under-served youth. Hm... That... That is so important. Mike Tyson, what charity are you playing for? The Mike Tyson Foundation. Can you tell us a little bit about the Mike Tyson Foundation? Oh, it's just a standard foundation. Just a typical foundation. Just like these two other foundations. No further questions and no, thank you. Uh-huh. Okay, chefs, let's open your baskets. We have baby octopus.

 Plantains. Smoked kippers. And cream of mushroom soup. Your 30 minutes begins now. Behind! I just froze. I mean... I had a plan for the baby octopus and the plantains, but when I pulled out those smoked kippers, man, it was like my head exploded. Behind! Those guys were flying around that kitchen like jackrabbits. I was just paralyzed by the clock. And also, I wish jackrabbit was one of the ingredients. I would have had a plan for that, too. Chefs, you have 18 minutes remaining on the clock. Looks like Rosalyn is grilling the octopus, which is... Oh, God! Mike, are you okay? I'm good, I'm good. This is just a tricky can-opener. I'm good. How much time did you say? Uh... A little under 18 minutes. Okay, okay, I'm gonna focus on the protein. Baby octopus. Baby octopus. Maybe I toast it? Gee! Bruce is already using the toaster to toast a baguette. Which he got from the pantry. Which is not even part of the basket. And I knew he was gonna lose points for that. So I was feeling pretty confident at this point. Behind! Behind! Behind! Five... four, three, two, one. Chefs, your time is up. Oh, damn. I must have cut myself. I hope I didn't get any on the food. Let's see whose dish is on the cutting board. What? Aw... Mike Tyson, I'm sorry, I'm afraid you're going home. Judges. Mike, you didn't cook any of the ingredients. You didn't open the soup. Nothing's been transformed. You've simply put everything in the blast chiller and... - Yeah, to get it cold. - Can I finish? Yes, ma'am. Sorry. But most importantly, the dish is covered in your blood. So, for these reasons, you're going home. Damn. Thank you, judges. Go, get 'em, guys. Of course I'm disappointed. The Mike Tyson Foundation needed that $10,000. But this just means that I have to try harder. And I'll be back. And this isn't the last you'll see of me. Where the **** is the car, Deezy? I told the driver to take the team sightseeing. I thought for sure you were gonna make it to that dessert round. Okay, hold on, Mike. I'll call the driver right now. To your left, uh, Lady Liberty. To your right, Lower Manhattan. You know, I was gonna open up a bar with a buddy of mine. Right there. You see where the little corner market is? That would've been our bar. We were all set to sign the paperwork and then... 9/11 happened. We needed an inspection to get the loan, but the whole city was shut down. Then six months later, my buddy falls off a fishing boat right off Montauk. They never found the body. So, no bar for me. What are you gonna do? Signal! Signal, please! In America, we use signals! Hello. Regal Luxury Transportation. Burt speaking. Mm-hmm. He's already outside waiting? Okay, uh, lemme... I'm gonna take the West Side Highway. Tell him I'll be there in 30 minutes. He doesn't need to stand outside and catch a cold. I'll text him when I'm there and he can come back out. Well, this is fun. Okay, Mike, he'll be there in 30 minutes. Cool, cool, then he can just take us back to the hotel. Well, Mike, when I booked the Presidential Suite at the Waldorf Astoria, I assumed you were gonna win $10,000. I think the prudent thing, financially, is for you to come home. No way, Deezy. All I want right now is to plonk myself in that big bathtub in the Presidential Suite at the Waldorf Astoria, and wash off all this blood and octopus juice. Okay, Mike, then at least do me a favor. We can make this whole trip tax-deductible if you were to do a mystery while you were there. That way, it's a business trip. You know, a write-off. Well, you're the brain, Deezy, okay? So, go dig around in the pigeon coop and find a mystery that takes place in New York City, Episode Title: "A Mystery in Little Italy" Was there anything cream-based in the basket? Like a... Like a cream of mushroom soup? Michael! You could have... **** you, Monday morning quarterback. It looks easy on television, mother****. Hey! Mike Tyson Mystery Team. I'm Sal DeBenedetto. Follow me. I'll take you to Mr. Russo. Who the hell are you? They call me the exterminator. Tell Mr. Russo he should let this office air out for the next two or three hours. Nobody tells Sal DeBenedetto what to do. Except for Mr. Russo. Come on. I bet I know where he is. His favorite pizza joint in all of New York City. Thank you for coming to see me, Mr. Tyson. You and your mystery team. Here, sit down. Sit. Sal, get everyone a chair. You get one for the **** bird. Yes, sir, Mr. Russo. Show some respect to the bird, you **** gamooch. So, what's your mystery? Please, please... First we eat. Have a slice. You never tasted anything like this. It's like my mama used to make. In Sicily. Huh? Huh? It's good, huh? It's pepperoni. Mmm. But they got other toppings, too. This place is... It's incredible. Now I... I need your help. It's a personal matter. My son Carmine is... He's disappeared. With $32 million of my money. I want you to find him and find out why he broke my heart. And then, I want you to bring him back home to me so I can kill him. Hey, Jason. You made an excellent pie tonight. One of your very best. Arrivederci. All right, let's go find this Carmine Russo. Dad, he just said he was gonna kill him. Deezy says the only way to make this trip a write-off is to solve a mystery. Hey, this one's not marked. Large pepperoni? Oh, here. 35147, Hester. Apartment 22. Carmine Russo. What? You're gonna pair very nicely. With that large pepperoni. Huh? Did you say delivery or DiGiorno? - Dad! - Michael! Why did you steal $32 million away from your father and break his heart? My father doesn't have a heart. I discovered that his waste management company is just a front for the mob. He's a despicable person. And that $32 million is blood money, so I'm gonna donate it to charity. I was just about to transfer the money but I couldn't decide what charity I wanted to give it to. I was leaning towards the Bruce Bowen Foundation. Hey, Mike! Over here. Hey, team. So how was the rest of your trip? You solved that mystery? I got good news and I got bad news, Deezy. The bad news is that we did not solve the mystery. But the good news is that we received a very generous donation to The Mike Tyson Foundation. $32 million! Holy shit, Mike! Is this for real? Deezy, watch out! Oh, my goodness! They got one of these here, too? Deezy, you're not gonna believe how good this place is. Deezy? Oh, damn! Deezy is dead. Oh, damn! Deezy's alive! Sync corrections by srjanapala
