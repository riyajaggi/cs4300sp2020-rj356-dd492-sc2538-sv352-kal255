Trevor, senior deckhand. - I'm Emily. - Trevor. I'm senior deckhand. - Hey, I'm Trevor. I'm senior deckhand. - Are you dating anyone? - I actually am.

 - I think it's wild. - Is this our stew? - I don't know what happened. I missed my plane. - We have our primary, Alison. - Hi! - She's Instagram friends with all of the other girls, but they've never, ever met. - Hey. - Kelley. - Kelsey. Nice to meet you. - It's been five months of no sex. Ooh, I'm in trouble. - Just make sure, when you're done with any hose, drain it. So, yeah, these windows and then flats. Just scrub this deck. - All right.

 Trevor telling us to do, like, every little thing. Don't treat me like I'm a green deckhand. - Hey, Trevor! - Got to be smarter than that. - Hey, Kelley. - The other two deckhands are having a little issue with Trevor. - He's your responsibility now, and just say, "Listen... "if you think you're indispensable, you're not." Nobody is. - Okay. Thanks, Captain. - Thank you. - I'm here to make a great first impression on Captain Lee. He said, "Figure it out." I'm trying to, but I'm trying to also dip into the pool of experience that you have, and this problem this early on is terrifying. Trevor, Trevor, this is Kelley. - Put some vinegar in this water here. - Yeah, there's some in there. - Go ahead, Kelley. - Where you at? - Meet you at the forward beam. - Roger that. - Actually, I don't know how to AirDrop. - Kate, what's our itinerary? - We're gonna have a beach picnic. - Are you looking for some? - Yeah. - You want to send it to me? - I probably do. I love you. - I wish all guests were this social media-obsessed. I could just lay in my bunk, Tweeting them dinner times and menu options. - Oh, your body is-- I mean, they're all insane. - Your body. - Your body! - How's it going? - Come to our stool. I'm very appreciative that I have you here. I'm glad that you have leadership experience, and, yes, you're the senior deckhand. But I have Nico and Lauren getting frustrated because sometimes you kind of bark orders to the other two. - Um... - Day one, I was like, "All right. he doesn't really know our experience." - Yeah. He does, though. We both talked about it together, about-- - Yeah, if it's gonna be every day... - Every day. - Seeing everybody's résumé, I know everybody knows what the hell they're doing, and I've seen it in action. - I feel undermined. If Nico and Lauren have a problem with me, they need to come discuss it with me firsthand, not go talk behind my back. Everybody can get a little snappy sometimes. I happen to sometimes too. - I understand, man. - Are you finished? - Yeah, go ahead. Yep. - Have you done beach parties before? - No. - So get excited. I'm gonna go over and show you how everything's set up. I'll pack the coolers with Pinot Grigio, champagne, diet Coke, sparking water. - Okay, so we're just serving. - Yeah. - Oh, that's awesome. - Super easy. - I love getting off the boat and being on the beach, even if I'm working. - It's just like serving on the boat. - But it's windy, sandy... - I used to love beach picnics... until I became a chief stew. So if there's one service where I'm not gonna be present, it's gonna be that one. And so get excited. - F---ing undermine me. - Whoo! - Hey, I've got some provisions that are on island. Is there any way we can get it picked up? - Let me check with Captain on that, but yeah. - All right. That would be awesome. - Do you need 'em today? - Yeah, yeah. It's for this evening's dinner. We're running out of gluten-free, fat-free, dairy-free, tasteless ingredients. Doesn't eat red meat. Someone doesn't like seafood. Others do like seafood. Somehow, I'm gonna have to make this crap actually taste like something. - Ben needs provisions picked up from Road Town for tonight's dinner. - If you got to have 'em, got to have 'em. - I'll take Lauren with me. - Make it quick. - Thanks, Captain. - Okay, Emily? You being second stew, you are lead on service. - Okay. - Wow, babe. We're moving up in the world, aren't we? - Oh, she's so... - We got to run to Road Town. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, and Nico? Can you start loading the inflatable with all of the beach stuff? - Yes. - You'll have Trevor helping you and Barry helping you. Thank you so much. - Yay! - I like Ben. He's nice. - Yeah. - Are him and Kate... - No. Kate's got a girlfriend. - What? Really? A girlfriend? I had no idea. Why? Are you interested? - Yeah, that's why I was asking. - I don't know where a cooler is. - Yeah, yeah. For sure. I hate these picnics. It sucks. It's a pain in the ass. They always are. Trevor, Trevor? - Are you on the beach right now? - I am on the beach, yes. - Pick a good spot. Give 'em a little palm tree. I got to finish something up here on the boat. I'll meet you at the beach soon. Nico sold me out to Kelley, so if you're gonna sh--talk me, you're gonna have to do the sh-- work. - F---. - Come on, Trevor. Where the f--- are you? - Talk to me. - Grilled asparagus with lemon and pine nut. Oh, that felt good, that cool air. - Really? - Yeah, baby. - I was dating this guy, and every morning, he would put cornstarch on his balls and then stand in front of the oscillating fan. It was like, "My fan's broken." - Trevor, Trevor. Come in, Trevor. - Go ahead, Nico. - Yeah, Trevor, if I could maybe get a hand out here? - So you were flapping his corn starched balls. - I sat on the toilet. He's like, "Ready? Go! So I went like this really hard, and I whacked him with the magazine. We're just talking about balls. - All right. - I need this dry. - Probably 'cause there's a lot of provisions. - Oh, is that what's happening? - Yeah. - More drinks? - Actually, can I get a glass of rosé? - Glass of rosé? - We need to write #beach party with sticks. - There we go. You f---! Come on, man. At least act like you're working. It's day three, and I'm ready to throw this guy overboard. There's no "I" in "team." It's me and you, canopy. Oh, f---, yes. - Here you go. Hold these. Two on each corner. Wait to do that side. - What? F---. Come on, man. - Kids that eat more than 20 hot dogs a year have, like, a 15% higher chance of getting childhood leukemia. - What? - It's that bad. - Abandon ship. - What's in this thing? A body? - Sorry that took so long. It was rough on the south side of Tortola. - I'm sure it was. - You want to drop us off over there and help? - Yeah, right, man. - It's a beach party. - Think this is enough rosé for them? - Yeah, I think so. - And then serving utensils are also in that bag. It's refreshing to finally have stewardesses who look up to me and respect me and want to learn. - Oh, it's a bottle opener. - It's in the bag that we just brought over. - Okay. - 'Cause I would love to pass on what I've learned. - Ready? - Yup. - Isn't this rad? - I put in "#beach party" in sticks, baby. - Y'all did a good job. I like it. - Yeah. It looks good. - Really? All he did was move around a few sticks. Played in the sand like a child. - Trevor, when she goes back, go on back with her. Wipe down the metal. Have the boat looking good. And once this is all wrapped up, we pick up. Then we'll take our break. - Come on. Get in there. - It's cool! - How's it going? - Good. - I think we're just ready for our beach party. - Okay, great. - Go like that. And this can go like this. - No, I got it. - Chicken salad, grilled asparagus... - Okay, the tender's ready to take you to the beach. - Thank you. - Great. - Ah! - Whoo! - Can you do waters? And then we can ask about alcohol. - Shut up. I love it. - Can I get anyone a drink? - I want to bronze. - This is unreal. - You guys are beyond. - Cheers. - Cheers, ladies. - You know what? My phone actually locks every two seconds. - Free chicken? No? - Is that gluten-free, right? - Yes. - Kate, Kate. - Go ahead. - The guests are all doing great. - Good job, girls. - Copy that. Okay. - What's your ideal time for dinner? Because-- - 9:00, 10:00. Probably the same sh-- as last night, yeah? - If they say anything else, you know what's coming out. - The bitch. - Mm-hmm. - Bring out Megabitch. - Why don't you go jump off the boat and drown? - All right, we're going. - I'm gonna swim as soon as I'm done eating. - Me too. - Whoa, there it is. Mm. Ooh, Kelsey. Thank you, God, for women like her. - Look at them. - Merci. - I only know German. Bitte. - What did you say? - Bitte. - Okay, bitte? - Yeah, it's-- You say danke for thank you and bitte for you're welcome. - It's gonna be great. - Yup. - We're gonna drown. - They're really hands-on. You think they're hot? - Yeah. - You good? That smile, man. Wow. - Those girls-- hate to say it-- will never marry a guy like us. You got that right. - Coming up... - Hey, you want to come down here to main deck? - I'm busy. - Guy has no respect for anybody on this boat. Hey, next time you tell me you're busy over the f---ing radio where Captain Lee can hear, we're gonna have serious f---ing issues. - Let's get the ladies. We got to go. - All right, ladies, when you're ready! - One, two, three. Run and jump. - Thank you, guys! - Beach party? First day with all three stews. And I got two really good ones. - Kate is just tickled with her interior crew. She feels like she just died and went to stewardess heaven. - I feel like God answered my prayers. - Thank you. - Did you have a good day? I had such a good day. - I was here for, like, a solid hour just 'cause I had to empty all the sh-- by myself. Trevor came at, like, the end. I was like, "I need someone else out here." - Did you ask for that? - Yeah, I had to. - Nico and I, like, get along so well. If Trevor's, like, annoying us, we can vent to each other about it because it feels like we've known each other for ages and it's like it's the first charter, which is insane. Um, this is, like, awkwardly romantic. - Skipping into the sunset? - Oh, my God, snacks? - Yay. - Okay, riddle me this: who doesn't like a really big dick? You don't like a big dick? Explain to me why. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Put it in. - I just have never met anyone who liked a small dick over a big dick. So, like-- - Yeah. - Come here for a second, girls. After turndowns are done, I'm gonna let you knock off. - I'm 6:00 a.m., 7:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m. - You're gonna be the early girl. - Okay. - I'll be up late with you. But I'll be up early. - I'm happy to do dishes. I'll help upstairs. - Sounds good, man. - Okay, thank you. - Got three more likes from my #beach party with all the sticks and rocks. Maybe that'll boost tips. - Maybe what? - What was it? Sticks? What? Ordinarily, I am a fan of the underdog. - I raked the beach out, and I found sticks, and I put a hashtag with sticks and spelled out "beach party" into it. - But Trevor does strike me as an odd duck. All right. Nice job, mate. - Yeah. - So I'm here to help. - Look at that. You look adorable. - I've had a lot of kitchen experience. I used to work in restaurants. And so to be in another department where it's almost like refreshing and quite therapeutic when I do dishes and stuff, 'cause I just zone out. All right, where would you like me? - Why don't we start stacking the trays, stack them all up here, and then put them away? - Emily, is there anything we can do for you? - I don't think so. We're all good. - All right, perfect. - What are you doodling? Just doodling? - I don't know, man. - Just say "doodling" one more time for me. - Doodling. - Yes, thank you. - What's wrong with me saying "doodling"? - It's been five months, people. Five. Women with accents is just wonderful on the ears. - Whoo! - That's a good one. - That is good! Yep. That's just like 1 of 20--yep. - Okay, all the guests are out and ready when you are. - Thank you, baby. - I'm sorry. - No, you're totally fine. - Pretty. - My love, can we get these-- just those-- - Yeah, I can. - It's all good. - Okay, what am I serving? - Pork scaloppini with... - Almonds, barley, butternut? What's the sauce? - It's a veal demi-glacé. - Anything on the chicken? Same way? Demi-glacé? - Yeah, yeah. No, no demi-glacé. - What is it? Teriyaki? - Truffle balsamic. - Whatever. This is chicken with almonds, barley, butternut squash, and a demi-glacé. - I don't think I can have the barley. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Let me get you another plate. I have no idea why Ben is serving barley to a gluten-free guest. - What's up? Is everything okay? - Everything's great. I just didn't want to give Kelsey any that had touched barley, if I could, you know? - Oh, f---. Barley has gluten in it. Yes, I did slip up. It's just really tough to keep up with all of these restrictions. - How good is this food? - You did not have to do that. Thank you so much. - I'm totally following Kelsey. - But it might be weird. Like, this is a bit soon, isn't it? - I just want to find her, and then I have her saved in my searches. - Okay. - Duh. - Kelley is the sweetest thing ever. - He's adorable. - He's so cute. - He's very cute. - She was giving me googly eyes. - She's like, "Oh, my God." - I found love! - They're all cute, though. I mean, what's going on, girls? Get it on. - Yeah. - We can make this happen. - I'm not into rich girls. You got to understand that some rich girls just want to have fun. - Sierra, Sierra, Emily. - She in there? - Oh, Sierra. Sierra, want to join the conversation? - Oh, sh--. - If you really want to know what's going on in the boat, hide in the laundry room for a couple hours. - Sierra, did you copy that? - Yeah, I did. I'm sorry. - Oh, hello. I'm--yeah. No, come down and help me with turn-down. - My wi-fi is not working, and it's driving me up up a f---ing tree. - Oh, my God! Stop it! - Hi, guys. - Sorry about the barley. It slipped my mind. - No, no, not at all. - You guys get my Instagram post? - Mine just dinged really loud. - That was my ding. "Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding." - Oh, wait, you're not even through your filter. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, my God. - I'm actually starting to question whether they're eating the food or just posting it on Instagram. - Your Instagram... - Okay, guys, thank you. F---ing hell. Wow. Next time, like, it would be nice if they spoke English. - Can we get on the walkie-talkies? - Wait, wait, wait. - How do we do it? Kelley, Kelley? - Kelley for Kiki. - This is Kelley. Go ahead, Kiki. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? I have a rule. I can't...touch her. Even though I'd love to put my hands all over her. - Lisa on behalf of Kiki. She's requesting your presence on the sky deck. - Roger that. I'll be up in a few. But it's Kelsey calling. It's like an angel. I laid this rule out with my deckhands, so I sure in the hell can't break it. - Get off the radio. - Okay. - Oh! - Uh-uh. - Whoo! - When a charter guest hits on you, you have to be kind of polite, 'cause you're stuck on a boat with them. But in this case, the charter guest is clearly interested, as is he. It's cute. - I did not do this. - Yeah, uh-huh. Sure. - It wasn't, I swear. - You red or yellow? - The yellow has the smiley faces on it, so you get that, and I want the emojis. The emojis are my favorite part. Current mood. - That's your current mood? - Yeah, this one. - Someone out there, tell me a story where a girl like this hooks up with a guy like me. I'm basically a butler. I'm an outside butler that sets up toys. Like, seriously, though, when does the butler ever get the hot girl that's rich? - Oh, I'm so sorry! - Oh, my God! No! I wasn't even paying attention. Oh! - I'm sorry. - You guys, we should all go to bed. - Thank you for coming up with us. - Yeah, you're welcome. - Good night, ladies. - Bedtime. - Do you like her? - F---. She's so pretty. - Is she? - Yeah. - Coming up... - But it's your job to do the toast. - They just asked me to do the toast. I didn't know there was even toast happening. - Oh, okay! I realize you don't give a f---, Kate, but I still do. - Come here. - For, like, to show the kids. - He's just being the biggest hypocrite I've ever seen. - Are you guys not liking the fact that? - Chelsea's pretty cute, huh? I think Kelsey, and then it goes to Nicole, maybe. - Which Nicole? Top one? - I think the top one, though, is 34. See, the bottom one's 26, so I'm gonna go with the 26. How old are you? - 22 this year. - 22? How old are you? - I'm 22 now. - 24, going on 25. - Oh, wow. - Young crew. - Yeah. That's what I am liking about this crew so far. And everybody seems to know their sh-- real well. Me and Kelley were a little bit nervous at the start. What's your wrist say? - "Relentless." - This one's just a giant jellyfish. - What's the meaning? - A good friend in Puerto Rico passed away surfing big waves, and then on my ribs, it says, "Wash out the fading away with the rising tide." - Were you with him? - Yeah. - That's really hard. - It's just a reminder, like, you know, anybody can be taken at any time. You know, enjoy life to the fullest. You got one chance. Take it. And be who you want to be. - It's good that they mean something. - This one's a black sheep eating a mushroom, so it means never follow the herd. Always be willing to get weird. That's way cool. - Trevor definitely is f---ing weird. - This one says, "Live and let live." The old oxen skull. - Oh, man. Take it in. - Good morning. - Hi, Kate. - Hi. Did you all sleep well? - It was amazing. - Awesome. - I slept well, but I'm so sad to leave. - Aw. - That's a very high compliment. - Sierra, Sierra, Lee. Is anybody from Interior up yet? I'd just like a cup of coffee if somebody's got a second. - I've got it. I'm on my way. I was a nanny prior to working on a boat, so there's a lot of similarities between charter guests and a baby. They need a lot of catering to and attention. So it helped me a lot. Wait'll you see this. Maybe she's not the domestic type. What do you think? The sugar's still in it, though. Time release. - Kate? - Yeah, hi. - Just gonna fess up to you. I overslept this morning. - Okay. - I'm so sorry. - Um, I don't really care if it happens once, but if it happens a couple times-- - It won't. - You know that you didn't do it on purpose. She's learning, and there's error when you're learning. - I'm so sorry. - It happens. - Stand by; we'll be pulling the hook and getting under way. - Roger that. - I'll give the direction. - I'm ready. What the f--- does that mean? I'm not quite sure where Trevor's going with this whole arm signal stuff. Just tell me it's off the bottom. Don't sit there like-- you know, I don't know, with a limp dick motion or whatever the hell that means. - Okay, Captain, anchor's at the water line. - Bring it up and put it home. You see, I just need clear, precise communication. It's really simple. - All right, lovelies. - Thank you. - Wait, did you get his number? - No. It'll be fine. - We're following each other on the 'Gram, so there will be DMs. - Oh! Aw, well, that didn't work, did it? Guys, you need a toaster up here. Did we do that? Did we do that? - Why-- - Did we do that? - No. Why are you yelling? Why are you shouting? - Because I just burnt the toast, and I burnt it yesterday, and it's not my job. It's your job. That's why. - Then just give me the bread and stop screaming. - Just bring the toaster up here. - Let's hide this, because we've got a chef. - What are we hiding? - The toaster. Keep it handy in the bilge. - Come on. It's the stewardesses' job to do the toast. - Okay, I'll handle the toast. Put it in the bilge. I love working with Ben, but there is one time that is a no-safe zone. Anything that happens during breakfast service, Ben is going to have a freak-out. - I realize you don't give a f---, Kate, but I still do. Is that all right? - I totally care about the level of service and quality. I just don't appreciate being interrupted-- - But it's your job to do the toast. - Then just ask me to do the toast. I didn't know there was even toast happening. - Oh, okay. I get it. You take it real personally. - All right, Ben. - Ready to go. - This was an amazing experience. - I like that everyone, like, went out of their comfort zone and, like, went along with the energy of it. - It's a testament to you. - Aw, it's not. It's a testament to everybody. - Thank you so much for organizing this. - Cheers to you guys. Cheers to you guys for coming. - Sorry about that. - Things are exploding. - I know; you're an artist. You had time to sit with your thoughts. - Yeah, I'm good now. - Any peace between Ben and I is always a temporary peace... We're happy again. - I'm telling you that. - I don't want to talk about the past. 'Cause you know there's always gonna be another charter that wants to eat breakfast. - Hugs, a little bit? Just a-- I know; it's awkward and weird. Okay, that was-- - Let's get ready on the aft deck. - Cap, you have 40 feet and closing on your starboard aft quarter. - Got it? - Lock that bow down. - Lock the bow down. Docking's extremely dangerous, because you're moving a couple hundred-ton vessel next to a floating dock that, if you nudge it, gives way. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. All right. No, that line needs to come tighter. - Copy that. - Tight, tight. Come on. - Tighten up on him. - Hey, hey, wait. Tighten up, or he's bringing it back over. - You don't need to take 14 wraps before you... - Lock it down? - Yeah. - You're f---ing killing me, guys. Trevor needs to control his mouth. Just do it. - Pull, pull. - Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. Lock it down. - Get that bow line tight. - Copy. - Happy, Cap? - Can't get it any closer than that. - You never back to the captain, especially Captain Lee. It's just disrespectful. - Whoo! - Coming up... - My deckhands don't listen to me. - You should be guiding them. You shouldn't be bossing them around. I don't boss them around, and I'm the boatswain. - F---. - I just want a picture. - How's it going? - Can you have Kelley, Nico, and Trevor come? - Yeah. I need all the deck crew in the sky lounge, please. They want to take photos with y'all. - Let's go, Trevor. I don't mind attention. I'll eat it up all day long. - Kelley's just look so good. - This is so cute. - You guys all have very nice feet. - They must get pedicures. - I'm gonna be famous now on Instagram. Let me--let me do this. - Come here. - For, like, to show the kids. - Where's the ring? - Where's Skipper? - I don't know. - Kelley gives us this huge splurge on how not to get close to the guests, and then all of a sudden, he's all about Kelsey and just being the biggest hypocrite I've ever seen. - Guys, like, we're all taking selfies? - All crew, I need you on the aft deck in ten. - Is this yours? - Yes. - Well, we had them on three carts on the way here. - Bags, bags. This one ready? - But we only have two carts? Kelley, Kelley, Trevor. - Yeah, this is Kelley. - You want to run and go get another cart for me? - F---ing idiot. - I can--I can do it. - I can't say anything; there's no say-so, 'cause he just comes back with, "I'm your f---ing boss." The captain's our boss. You know, we have the exact same experience. You got to give me some f---ing control. - Oh, my God, I'm, like, sad that it's over. - I thought it was like sleep-away camp for adults. Like, living with girls you don't know, and you're like, "Hi, I'm so-and-so." It's like the best experience of your life. - I don't want to disembark. - Thank you guys so much. It was so awesome. - Good-bye. - Farewell. It was so nice meeting you. See you later. - Okay. - I love you. You're an amazing team. You're so kind. Like, I kind of felt like you were my friends. Your meals--I came out feeling like a little pregnant. I'm leaving feeling like I'm about to have triplets. Everybody was amazing. Your hashtags-- Just all of you were unbelievable. So that's for all of you. - Thank you. - #LoveYouAll. Bye, guys! - Whether me and Kelsey continue talking after she gets off charter is to be foreseen, but I'll keep my fingers crossed. I want that to happen. - Time to go to work. - So what now? - Now we get the boat ready again. Are you loving it? - Yes. - Nico's really cute. How old are you? - 21. - He's 22. He's a year older. - My last boyfriend, he was boatswain, and I was a junior stewardess. And then I ended it with him. - In, like, six years, he's gonna be the hottest thing on the planet. - Really? - Yes. - If I were to have some magic dust and build my own boyfriend, he'd have brains, experience, be witty, not too hairy. And I'm not too fussed about hands or feet or... Genitalia size. - You guys would be a really cute couple. - Maybe. - If he wasn't 22 and I wasn't a lesbian... - Attention, all crew. I need everybody in the crew mess in two minutes. Two minutes, please. - Hey, girl. - Come on. Yup, yup, sit here. Sit here. I just want to see my tip. I want to taste it. I want to eat it. I want to have it in my pants. - All in all, I think everything went really good. Your interior staff, I think, is going to be very good. - Captain Lee never really gives a full compliment. He really means we're amazing. - Your deck staff, I think, is doing okay. What I'd like to see is everybody just dial it back a little bit, especially the new guys. - "Dial it back"? Just, like, I haven't gotten congratulated on anything I've done. I know I raised the charter tips. - This is not a sprint. This is a marathon. And I don't want to see anybody crash and burn. And on that note, the charter was very happy. 15 large. $1,360 per person. Not a bad way to start out. - I'm so happy with the tip. We pulled it off. It was our first charter. And so far, so good. I think we've got a good team. - I'll get up for that, for sure. - Thank you. $1,300 and s-- or it evened out to-- it broke down to 13 and... Um, whatever. My mind was blown. - You can go out this evening, grab dinner, couple pops. But tomorrow is a work day. Exercise good judgment this evening. Okay, good job, everybody. - Thank you. - Whoo! - Go to work. - We have to do the decks as well, don't we? - Okay, I'm gonna grab one more bucket and put this down here. - Let's go around and strip all the beds, put all the sheets in a large pillowcase. You guys can go through this cabin. You do the other one. And then maybe split that one. - You look so happy. - She always looks so happy. - Yay. - Where's Trevor at? - You bought a car? - Toyota 4Runner. - 4Runner, okay. - You've got 154 foot of yacht to clean, and with me sitting right in front of you, you're buying a truck? - I got to go down and get my account number and routing number. - Moron. - Sorry, where you up to here? - The stainless needs washing-- - Nico, Nico, Lauren. - Go ahead. - I'm down here trying to figure out this accounting stuff, but could you just continue on on both stairwells before you start washing the main deck? - Yeah, yeah, we're already on bridge deck aft. - Thank you. - Thanks, boss. - That's ridiculous. If I have a radio, I wouldn't be like, "Oh, hey, I'm up here. Can you please get started on this?" - "Hey, I can't finish this. Can you start it out for me?" - Yeah, exactly. - It's just a nonstop battle that we're having with this guy making us work twice as much 'cause we're spending half our day talking about Trevor, half our day talking to Trevor. So it's just affecting us all as a team. - Hey, Lauren, what's been going on with our toilet? - I don't think it's flushing properly. - You know who to call for that? - Yeah, boss man. Trevor's the second engineer on the boat, so when you have a clogged toilet, who are you gonna call? Number two. - Listen, y'all. Karma's real. - Trevor, Trevor, Kate. - Go ahead, Kate. - There's a plumbing issue in the crew cabin. There's just some stuff that shouldn't be there, and it still is there. If you could get that to go away, that'd be great. - Soon as I finish, I'll come check it out. - Yeah, it'll be there waiting. Sierra, Sierra, Kate. - Hello. - Hi. - Why aren't you flushing, you f---ing bastard? Ugh! Girls, lay off the fiber. God damn! - Just so you know, the roller iron was still on. Just turn it off. - Yeah, it was in the restroom. I'm so sorry. - No, that's okay. I am a little bit worried, because Sierra is always smiling. - It won't happen again. - Just always turn it off when you leave the room. She has happy resting face. You know who has those? Lunatics. And Labradors. - Okay. Thank you. - Thank you. - Oh, so gross. I want a cocktail. - Trevor, hey, you want to come down here to main deck? - I'm busy. - Uh, yeah. Come down here. - Okay. - "I'm busy." F---ing out of your mind. Meet me on main deck aft. Guy has no respect for anybody on this boat. - This is Kelley's first time as a boatswain. I've actually been a boatswain. Oh, f---. If Kelley didn't have such a big ego, he'd realize that I could actually show him how to be a good boatswain. - Hey, next time you tell me you're busy over the f---ing radio, where Captain Lee can hear, I'm gonna have serious f---ing issues. I'm your f---ing boss, so you don't tell me you're f---ing busy. - Coming up... - I'm gonna go to bed now. I'm not dealing with this. - Why do you take everything so harsh? - Good job, senior deckhand. - Hey, hey, hey. - Next time you tell me you're busy over the f---ing radio, where Captain Lee can hear, I'm gonna have serious f---ing issues. The way you communicate is not working out. - I'm trying my best. I'm sweating my ass off. And then, yeah, I get chewed the f--- out by Kelley, and I don't know how much more I can bite my tongue. - All right. - All right. - Ugh, we just finished. - Yes. Favorite shirt. - You happy now? - Not yet. Can't feel it yet. - Did you get an IV or something? Little alcohol drip? Look at your face. Like, "This kid's serious." - Seriously douchey. - That was a good one, dude. Ah! - You guys almost ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. - Are you ready? - Freedom! - Yeah. - I'm so happy right now. - What got us through the last day of the charter is knowing that we can just, like, crack open that first drink and be like, "Ah!" Just shower in it. - All right, you guys. To an awesome crew, an awesome first charter, and to the rest of the f----ing season. - Yay! - Right on! - Chhhh! Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug. - What did y'all think of the tip? - They were super generous, and it was such a short time. - For three days, it's pretty damn good. - Actually, they set the bar very high. - Yeah, they did. This season's gonna be great. Like, for you, it's gonna be awesome. - If you ever, ever need anybody just to vent to, just come talk to me. - Got it. Thank you. - Kelsey's beautiful. She's stunning. But she's not here, whereas Emily's cute. She's got an amazing accent, and she's here. - Can I get a Long Island, please? - Lentil rice and the pan-sued solmon... - Ben, order for us. - Can we get one of everything apart from-- - First order is jerky. - Just to start, get the ball rolling. - I want to get next round. - I'm doing fine, thank you. - Taste mine. Taste mine. - No. - Trevor is looking to go a lot harder than everyone else wants to. - I'll take another Long Island, please. - He just strikes me as the type that could get out of control. - Sierra, you have the f---ing smile of a god. You have the attitude and personality of a god. If I could combine you two... My God. - I'm just an asshole. Don't mind me. Everybody hates me here. - I'm gonna get a drink. - Yeah, let's get one. - Get me a Long Island. - Okay. - The first charter, a little bit of sh-- hit the fan, but I just want to push forward, forget it, and let's go let our hair down. I'm getting everybody shots. - I'm good. - It's not fun if you do that. Ben, would you take a shot? - No. I'm shotted. - I mean, I would rather go back to the boat. - Oh, can we go back? Please. - Liquor, wi-fi... - Let's go! - F--- this bullsh--. No one's gonna just sit here. Are you gonna dance? - What? - Are you gonna dance? - Yeah, man. - You all ready? Where's the truck? - I'm gonna get more twisted than all you guys, and you guys are gonna be like, "Wow, Trevor can handle a lot of liquor." In the morning, I'm gonna be like... - We're gonna go back. - Don't make me stare at your boobs anymore. - Oh, my God, really? - You ready? - It's f---ing bullsh--. - Dude, you need to calm down. Chill, bro, chill. - F---ing kidding me? - It's our first night out. We need to be responsible. - It's not my style. We're making a sh-- ton of money. We're having fun. And yeah, we're going back early, but we're gonna kick it in the hot tub, man. F---. - Oh, are we? - Yeah, I'm not going to bed right now. - Okay, 'cause I thought the whole crew was ready to go to bed, 'cause everybody wouldn't dance. I've never been on a charter yacht that everybody was this f---ing blatant stagnant mother----er. - What a f---ing twat. - Please trust me. - It'll be good. I do trust you. I'm just saying I can't have-- You don't understand how f---ing undermined I feel. I mean, I feel super, like...pfft. Like, dude, I'm just not that-- - Your deckhands know everything. You're treating them like they're greenies, though. - No, I'm not. - You are. How you speak to them on deck, I've heard you. You should be guiding them. You shouldn't be bossing them around. I don't boss them around, and I'm the boatswain. - You've got to understand that they're undermining me when you're gone. - F--- that, man. F--- that. - Right? It's so rude. - No, he's a twat. - Look, let's talk about this in the morning. I want to go get in the hot tub. - Let's talk about it. Talk about it. - Not, like, after you've been drinking. You need to be able to bring it to me sober... - Okay. - With the facts... - I'm talking about I'm being undermined. Okay, this is not alcohol. F--- that sh--. Don't f---ing bring that up. - Why can't he just let it go? If he just chills out... - All right, I'm heading in. - F---. - I'm gonna go grab board shorts. This is my night off. I just want to jump in the Jacuzzi and relax. - Where you going? Where you going? - No, I will come back up. - Who's all up there? - It's the deck crew. You should come too, 'cause there's heaps of tension, and it's really awkward. - I can't wait. Let me get on my bikini, okay? - I was, like, 14. - What? Just shut your mouth. - I'm being honest, dude. - I'm sitting in a Jacuzzi on a Sunday in some dude's basement when I was 14 years old. What does some 14-year-old or 15-year-old kid you're talking about... F---. I'm right. - You weren't being undermined. That was just f---ing plain rude, bro. - How do you expect to lead anybody if you're that disrespectful? - I'm gonna go to bed now. No, I'm not dealing with this. I don't want to hear it. - Why are you taking it so harsh, though? - Because it's sh--. - Why don't you keep your opinion to yourself? 'Cause I don't care how you think about my shading. - Okay, hey. Take him down. - Good job, senior deckhand. - Hey, hey. - I'm not talking sh-- about you, bro. - F---. - Do you have two brain cells? Or do you just have one rubbing up on the side of your head? That right there was the perfect example of what's wrong with your leadership. You don't respect anybody. - That's not true. - That is. Anybody below you, you don't respect. I want you to go down and go to bed. Go. We'll talk in the morning. - You're saying-- - No, no. I'm done with this conversation. Go down. Legit order. Go to bed. Go. - Holy f---. - No, no, I'm done with this conversation. Go down. Legit order. Go to bed. Go. - Holy f---. Sure enough, Kelley has to blow it out of proportion. He thinks he should step in and be some type of father figure. Like, I don't care who you are. You're not gonna do that, 'cause my dad's my dad, and you're not it. - The amount of times he's said sh--, like, he's literally digging himself a hole. - Who? Oh, Trevor. - He's being a dick. He's like, "Oh, so where's your tattoo from? Oh, it looks like sh--." - I really actually like your tattoo. I was gonna say that. - Something's got to be done with whatever the f---'s going on. - It's negative. - Right. - He always takes it to a negative tone, always. - All I'm thinking is, "I got to go back to my cabin, and he's rooming with me." - Nico, I'd prefer if you slept in the guest room. Sleep in one of them, please. - I need to get some space right now. I can't be around this guy. - Nico. - It's not worth it. I don't know what's going on. I really don't, 'cause I wasn't there. It doesn't matter. - I just want you to go to bed. I told you no, we'd talk in the morning... - F---. - Once we've all calmed down, so I want you to go to bed. Dude, go to bed. It's not that hard. Go to bed. - So just go to bed. - I'm going to bed. - All right, good. - This is a yacht and we work together, and we got to figure this out. Or sh--'s hitting the fan soon. - It's either him or me. That's it. - Next time on "Below Deck"... - We have some yachtees, and then we have Scupper. - He has a tuxedo. - Oh. - I'm prepping dog food right now. Please don't disturb. - Could we push dinner to 9:00? - Yes, of course. - When people don't listen to me, this is what happens. I just want to make sure that's clear. - Okay, great, yeah. I don't know what your problem is. You don't know what communication is. - Well, that was the problem, wasn't it? - Last night is unacceptable. If I see anything happen, I will personally have you gone. - What, you think you're f---ing special? - You're the only problem that I have. - I can cheers one with you if it's the last night. - This is a total no-no. - What's one shot gonna do to a guy like me? Oh, sh--. - Know what? You're done with that.
