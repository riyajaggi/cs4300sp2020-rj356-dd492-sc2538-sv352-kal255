Let it go. - Just slacken it out. - Go in, he's drowning! - Get me in. - Jesus Christ. - Go ahead. - Hey, are you okay? - Captain, Captain. Ashton's in the water. - Get his ass out of the water and on board. - Oh, my God. - That was so scary. - What happened? - Are you okay? Jump in the tender. He's getting into the tender right now. He's okay. - He got tangled in the ropes. - I'm gonna get Ashton to bring the towline on board and drop "Intrepid." - I'm having like an adrenaline... - No, I know. - That was frightening. ♪ ♪ - I've never been in a situation like that before. Ashton and I are on the swim deck, and as we're paying out the towline, for the tender to tow behind us, Ashton steps on the line. It wrapped around his ankle very quickly and pulled him off the boat. ♪ ♪ Thank God for Brent, the camera guy. He didn't hesitate for a second, you know? He put that camera down, and he did what he needed to do, and... ♪ ♪ I just--Ashton owes Brent his life. ♪ ♪ - All right, let's just get-- get these fenders up for now. - (BLEEP) sakes. - We're proceeding out.

On my way up. - Mind telling me what happened? - I believe Ashton got caught on the line and dragged in the water, So I don't know if he was trying to get it over the cleat or-- I'm not too sure. - That is a really stupid move. That scares the (BLEEP) out of me. We were within 30 seconds of him dying. I'd have to call his parents and tell them their son's dead. And I'm responsible. [solemn music] I don't know how I'd deal with that. ♪ ♪ All right. Well, go get calmed down. Make sure everything's secured back there. - Yep, my apologies, Cap. ♪ ♪ - I have kids. And I don't know how I'd make that call. ♪ ♪ I need a minute. ♪ ♪ - (BLEEP). - I just heard him and I turned around. - What just happened? - I'm like, "Oh, my God." - Well, when you're gasping for breath and being dragged underwater, it is forever. - So, near death experience... It's scary, man. - It's so scary. We don't want people to know how dangerous the job is, because that would be scary, but it is, and I think Ashton and what happened today, is a very good reminder. - Tender, tender. Bow deck out to "Seanna." - Go ahead, "My Seanna." - Yeah, how you riding back there? - I'm all good, Captain. I'm fine, thank you. - You okay physically? - Uh... - We're gonna get you on board as quick as we can. Get your foot elevated, get some ice on it, and then the doctor will be able to see you at 6:00. - I can't pick the tender up now, because we're out in open water and swells are just too bad to try and make that pick up. It's not a pleasant situation, to say the least. - Just puts life into perspective, you know? It's like, one minute you're here, one minute you're gone. All I'm thinking is, you know, I can't wait to see Ashton. Give him a hug. But also, at the same time, ----ing slap him. Like what the (BLEEP) were you thinking stepping over that line?

I should never have been on the water side of that line. Um, and I know that. These are things that I've been trained not to do. As I hit the water, I was fighting to get my head up to get air. I realized the line is gonna not take tension. It was the most intense force that I've ever felt in my life, the way that that line tightened around my ankle. In that moment, I'd mentally prepared myself for my foot to be ripped off. Nobody would have got to me in time to stop the bleeding, and I would have just bled-out in the water. Brent managed to get those lines off just in time. So, I'm--you know, I owe my life to the guy. ----ing thank God. - Let's see how you're doing. Not too bad. I thought it was gonna be worse. - Well, I've had that whole tender ride to think how stupid I was. I mean... - I would rather focus on how lucky you were. - Yeah. When I was in the tender, there were times I wanted to throw up. There were times I was almost in tears. And then there were times where I was just calm. - So, we'll just keep it iced down, keep it elevated above your head. - Thanks, Cap. Appreciate it. - For dinner tonight, I have these beautiful chicken breasts. - That chicken looks so good. - Who ordered chicken? - Who ordered chicken? - Chicken is what poor people eat. - You're not wrong. - Chicken's not acceptable. - Ashton, are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm good. - Oh, my God. It's swollen. - But it's good compared to what it could have been. - That was scary sh--, man. - So sca--you thank God. - Do you usually tow the tender? Isn't somebody-- - Yeah. Yeah, we normally do it. - Why doesn't someone drive it? - It's just easier. - So, someone will-- - Yeah, easier--easier. - 'Cause a lot of ----ing corners are being cut around here. - It was my fault completely.

Oh, no. Who made this bed? - If Laura had really ever been a Chief Stew, she would put herself in my position and wouldn't come out so hot from the start. - Like, you just arrived. Wait a second to see what's going on before... - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. - Hi, darling. How are you? - I'm ----ing sore, but it could be worse. - Do you want me to get you some dinner? - That would be amazing. - Yeah? - Thanks, man. Thank you. - Of course. - I've worked on deck before, and you do hear all these horror stories, and the main thing that everyone wants to make sure is that Ashton is okay. You know, we just need to look after him until he gets better. - Thanks, brother. I appreciate it. - No worries. - Joe, you ready to hop in? - I'm ready. - It's a blistering 92. - Did you want a drink, as well? Tequila and grapefruit. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. I've never really had a crew member almost die right in front of the charter guests. I think in a situation like this, cocktails are the answer. So, we were just talking about dinner. How does 8:30 sound? - Perfect. - I'm so glad to be a part of this. - Ross. - Ross, we got the tender approaching with the Doc in it. - Copy. - I'm Captain Lee.

Thank you for coming out. - It's okay. [exciting music] - You can start bringing it in. - Right. Once we've got these in, Rhylee, you can do down. You don't need to change in blacks. - And then what time do you want me out? 10:00? - 10:00. ♪ ♪ - So have you got any pain? - It is painful, but she's given me strong painkillers. So I'm hoping it gets better quickly. - You rest up, brother. I'm gonna get back to work and pick up your slack. - Now that I'm not there, you can see how much I actually do. [laughter] ♪ ♪ - Laura, Laura. Kate. Come up and start the turndowns in the lower guest quarters. - Copy that. - Taking this third stew role, I may or may not have shot myself in the foot. I forgot how mundane a third stew position really is. I honestly haven't done turndowns in years, but it probably doesn't matter, because on this yacht, the bar is set kinda low. - Guests are seated. - They did a wonderful job decorating. [exciting music] ♪ ♪ - The guests got off to a rough start this morning, witnessing what happened to Ashton. So for dinner tonight, I have these beautiful chicken breasts. Chicken is comfort food, man. ♪ ♪ - That chicken looks so good. ♪ ♪ [laughter] - For the main course tonight, I made a oven-steamed chicken breast rolled with mozzarella, tomato, and basil, spinach polenta, and asparagus. I love surprising people. I like giving them everyday things and just deconstructing them, making something totally fresh. Giving them new perspective on food in general. Enjoy. - Thank you. - Thank you. - So good. - Who ordered chicken? - Who ordered chicken? - Anyone? It's well done. - But it's delicious. - It is good, but none-- none of us ordered it. - It's still chicken. - It's chicken. Chicken is what poor people eat. [laughs] - You're not wrong. - Is everything okay? - None of us put chicken on our preference sheet. I can have chicken at home. - Would you like him to make you something else? - I would like seafood. - Yeah. - This chicken does look amazing, and while I agree that maybe they should have some shrimp with it, I also wouldn't act like an asshole about it. - Drunk Kari, she said she didn't put chicken... - What? - On her preference sheet. And she's got chicken. This one's Kari, here. - Should I make scallops or salmon? - She likes basic-- - Scallops. - Oh, she does like scallops. - ----ing care if it's on their preference sheet. You can go in the fanciest, 30-star Michelin restaurant, they'll serve you chicken. If you don't put that you don't want chicken on your preference sheet, I'm gonna cook it for you. - So, Adrian's preparing some scallops for both of you guys. - Oh, perfect. - "I didn't have ----ing chicken on my preference sheet." - Chicken's not acceptable. - Are all the turndowns done? - Yeah. Do you need me to clear anything yet or no? - No, we're good. I think you can go to bed. - Night. - Boom. - Thank you. - No, thank you. - Beautiful. - None of us put chicken on our preference sheet. - Pardon, me. So, Adrian's made a creamy leek-seared scallop over a tomato-parmesan risotto. - He should have made this from the beginning. - And he made extra, so I think everybody wins here. - I ate so much. - How are you feeling now? - Feeling good. Yeah. - Better? It was a good day. - Yeah. Well, it was a-- - I mean, not a good day. - Yeah. - But... - Yeah. - Crazy. I started my own insurance agency in Seattle when I was 21 years old and crushed it, but I just knew I didn't wanna be in the corporate world because I live off adrenaline. - Yeah, we had a rough start. There's nothing worse than that. - Ashton getting dragged into the water is not the adrenaline high I was looking for. Rhylee's up. Waiting for her to get dressed. - Once she's done, you go down, and I'll see you at 6:00. - I'm gonna go check the turndowns. Oh, my God. Look, Josiah. "Chief Stew" my heinie. Nobody was using the deck towels since dinner started. - Let's dance and party. - Not having waters by the bed, that was a Caroline-type mistake. [sighs] Honey, if you were a Chief Stew that knows as much as you say you do, you should already know how to do turndowns. What kind of boat are you working on? - That's better. - I don't wanna say you're the best, but you're the best. - Good night. - Sleep well. - Okay, let's see if there's stars. - I can booty shake. - Oh, my God.

Pain? - You haven't happened to see my little... - Yeah, I have it. I'm sorry. I had to go do turndowns that weren't done by the girl who used to be a Chief Stew.

I could really appreciate some positive feedback, and instead, I'm kind of getting a little bit of this mean girl thing going on. - That's right, you're supposed to do the bitch work and shut your mouth about it.

[upbeat music] - So, Carolyn's up. - Yeah, Carolyn's up. Jimmy's on his third coffee. - Good for him. - Yeah. - At nighttime we pre-load the coffee machine, so in the morning all you have to do is press the button. - Okay. - And have you ever done turndowns before in your life? - Yeah, so, what happened last night? Because Adrian came in and he was like, "She's so mad." I was like, "Oh, my God. What happened?" - What did happen? - The only thing I didn't do was the second bed, because I thought there was only one guest sleeping in there. - You don't put waters next to the beds? I mean, I've never even been to a three-star hotel that doesn't give water to guests. - I agree. That's--I totally agree. But I didn't realize like, what we did or--whatever. - You can ask me, the Chief Stew of the interior. - Okay. I thought we weren't caring. I thought that was the vibe, honestly. Yeah, my bad. - Now you can change into Pilates wear. - Yeah. - Morning. - Morning. - This is the towline. - Yep. You said to coil it up like that, right? - That's fine. You stay right here.

When guests are drunken assholes, it blows over my head at a rate that you cannot imagine, because I know that the food that came out was great.
