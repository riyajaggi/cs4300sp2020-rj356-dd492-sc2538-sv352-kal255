 - Previously on "Below Deck"... - Okay. Yeah, that'd be cool. What are you sending money home for? - My daughter. - Oh. - Yeah. - I didn't know you had one. - Didn't you? - Mm-mm. It's kind of a red flag. - It's been five months of no sex. - I'm gonna sweep her off her feet, and she's not gonna know what f---ing hit her.

 - Kyle and Sierra, they're going fishing and for dinner. - We're going. - They want a themed dance party on the yacht, and Steve wants to surprise Rachel by proposing. - Rachel-- let me get on my right-- - Yes! - Will you marry me? - Yes! Yes! - I have a flower order coming. Do you want me to add to it? - I would like that. I would like to take you for dinner. - What's she saying? - I would love to. - That's very good. - Kelley's like, "Maybe if we, like, "ram the tender into the pool and push it out the way,

 it'll happen," but every time he pulled back, the pool just quickly swung in. - What are you doing? - Go ahead, back out of there, Kelley, as soon as she gets it loose. - Guests are standing there watching us, and we're like, "Ugh." - Jesus Christ, he could f--- up a two-car funeral. - Are you guys leaving me? - Oops. - It's f---in' embarrassing. It's 7:40. - Ooh, it looks even better in the daylight. Go like... - Really? - Yeah. - It's so bourgie. - That's how they do it. ♪ Love is in the air ♪ I feel it. I feel it. I feel it. Yep, that's definitely love. We all know Ben. He's usually pretty popular with the ladies. - Can this be our Christmas card next year? Do you like salmon? - I love salmon. I love you, Ben. - But I've never seen Ben this way around any girl. He seems nervous, and it's really cute. - Don't you guys have a job? - Kelley, Kelley, Lee. - Go for Kelley. - To the bridge, please, sir. - Yes, sir. En route. What's going on, Captain? - I wanted to chat with you about yesterday. We had the guests on the aft deck, and that fiasco with the pool was just a total embarrassment. I know you felt it, because I could see it by looking at you. He's in charge of the exterior. He's in charge of water activities. He's in charge of guest satisfaction outside the interior. I mean, it's not rocket science. Your crew, they're looking to you for guidance and direction. You're not always gonna be able to be their friend, and you're gonna have to get their attention and say, "Listen, no, don't do what you think is right. Do what I tell you to do." - I am trying to take everything Captain Lee is teaching me as constructive criticism, instead of getting defensive or anything like that. But at the same time, it's too much at times. - When you're out in the ocean, you don't always have the luxury of being nice about things. You need it done, and you need it done now, because 30 seconds from now is too goddamn late. - Fair enough. - All right, pal. - Thanks, Captain. All right, ready with that. Thank you. - It's French toast. - What? - How cute. - Look at that. - Oh, my God. That bacon's good, too. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, if you want to stay here in the galley, I'm gonna go around and check the rooms... - Okay. - And start planning the dance party. - How are you? Where has the morning gone? It just whizzed past. Hasn't it? - One thing leads into another. Did you catch up on sleep? - Yes, I had a really good sleep. - Good. - I'm seeing Ben in a different light and not with a big bravado and confidence and being very cheeky and witty. I'm suddenly seeing a very sweet side to him. It's thrown me. - I just don't think I'm very good at sleeping, to be honest. - I always have a kind of mild tea before bed. - I should probably take some kind of sedative immediately after service. Yeah. - Deck crew, deck crew, let's put the slide out. - Three, two, one. - Wow. - After yesterday, I think Lee's just got it out for the deck crew. - How are the lines looking up there? - There's no tension on 'em right now. - All right, tighten 'em up where there is tension. - He's just watching us and being like a hawk. - I'm gonna miss Frankie. - You are? - He is so cute. - No. He's so not your type. He reminds me of Turtle from "Entourage." - Yeah, he does. - So what about you and Kyle? - I don't think he wants it to be a group thing. Can they come? - Why don't you guys go? All three of you go, have a f---ing triple date. - Because, you know, you kind of have somebody on land that you're into. - No, I was gonna tell him. I'm currently single, but I met a guy before I came on this boat; he's not my boyfriend. If a guy texts you on Valentine's Day, he's into you. I just want to, like, go and chill out and not kill the vibe before we even get there, you know? - Yeah. - I want to catch the fish. Yeah. - Start back here. Three, two, one. Go. - Oh, my God. - Aw. - Whoo! Ooh! - Oh, ho-ho, she got movin'. - It's freezing! - I can't believe they go off board tomorrow. Do you know what that means? You're gonna go fishing, and then we're going dancin'. - Okay. - Yeah. - Sounds like a plan. My horoscope said I'm gonna be on all day. - What did mine say? - I didn't read yours. - That's a good start to a relationship. F--- your horoscope. - What does this do? So Ben. - Yes. - Let's talk about tonight. - Yeah. - So I'm doing, like, a white chapel wedding Elvis/Vegas theme. So will you be Elvis? You've got the darkest hair. - Oh, phht. No. - Say something Elvis-y. - No. - You don't know how good that looks You should keep those for everyday. - Oh. - Fine. - Has Steve mentioned anything about hitting golf balls to you? - Not today, he hasn't. - He's interested in golfing on the yacht. That's cool. - I'll go talk to him and see what-- - Yeah, see if he-- if he's still up for it, if he wants to do it, because we're running out of daylight. - Okay. Hey, Steve. - Yeah. - I know you talked about golfing. - Yeah. - Are you still... - Sorry. - Interested in doing that? - Yeah. - Okay. So we'll get that set up right now before we start losing all the light so you can actually see how far you hit. - That's pretty awesome. Cool. - All right, great. - Thank you. - No problem. So we're gonna get this removed. I'm gonna go get the stuff up. - No, he's not gonna hit off the bunny pad. - Oh, he's not gonna hit off-- - No, that's not gonna happen. - Okay. - No. - Sorry. I thought that's-- - Go get the mat and we'll set it up right in front of those two handrails. - Okay. Roger that. - It's really getting kind of old. I still have to come up with a plan of action every day for every activity for everything that's getting done. It just doesn't seem to be happening. - So we're gonna hit golf balls. - F---, I was getting dressed already for the night. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Can you throw something casual on? - Mind if I hit one, Cap? - Yes, I do. - I played golf, Cap. - I don't care. - Captain seems to be really on Kelley's ass, and I understand why, but at the same time, I've been there myself before, and it was not fun. - So here's what we got. - Okay. - An antiquated 5 wood. - Uh-huh. You found these on the bottom of the ocean. - May have. - I dove and got 'em for you. - I'm just gonna try not to hit that or any of this. Chipping paint's like 10 grand. I didn't break anything. - Oh, there you go. - This is great. You feeling confident? - No. Try to hit that boat. - I tried it. Into the wind, it's challenging. - It's impossible, huh? - Oh, that sounded good. - Good one. - There you go. - There we go. - That's cool that they set it up. - Dude. - Okay. - We got a couple playing through here. - Hey, Nico. - Hey. - Are you an Elvis fan? - Elvis Presley? Why? - Yeah. Would you like to be Elvis tonight? I mean, you are the most handsome. - Well... - Like, look into this reflection, and just, like, really-- - Be him. - Yeah. - Be Elvis. - Yeah. Hold on. - Maybe I look like Elvis. Chiseled jaw, great looks, charming personality. Oh, thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. A'right? - Kelley, Kelley, Kelley, would you be at all interested in being one of our Vegas entertainers this evening? I'm thinking... - Oh, no! - Ben, are you re-- can I seat the guests? - Yes, please. - How cool! - That's so cool. - Ooh. - It was like-- it's like the Vegas-- - Oh, my gosh, how cute! - And this is your bow tie. - I don't know how to make that into a bow tie. She knows how to tie a bow tie. That's pretty impressive. I'm not sure if Emily's looking for a relationship, if she's looking for nothing, if she's looking just for fun, like me. But as of right now, who knows? - Meow. - I think Kelley is quite sentimental and soft, so I don't want to tell him that I'm going on a date with Ben. Oh, look at that. He's a lovely guy, and I don't want to hurt him, and I don't want this to affect our friendship. - Please take pictures. Now. - Babykins. - Yes. - Here we go. - Thank you. This is the eggplant with? - That's it. Truffle, soy. Spicy crab roll. - Thank you. - So when we were talking about diamonds, I was like, "I want eight carats." And he was like, "Yeah, three is my max." And I was, like, "I'll compromise and give you four." - Go figure. I love it. - Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. - Oh, my God, so good. - I gotta give the kids a little bit more room. - Oh, yeah. - Then stop staring at the moose knuckle. - Coming up... - Ben, your lady is waiting in the main salon. - What lady? - Emily. They're going on a date. - Oh. What? - Yeah, you look great. - Everything was good. - Yeah, it was. - F--- yeah. - F--- that, dude. - No, that looks good. Huh! - Let's do this. - So we'll go have a little dance party. Deck crew, deck crew, we're on our way up. Please start the music. - Copy, baby. - Come in, guys. - Oh, we-- - Come on in! - We got strippers. Yeah, we got strippers! - Come on in. - Uh-oh. - Welcome to Las Valor. - What happens in Las Valor stays in Las Valor. Baby! Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh! - Yeah! - Huh! Huh! Elvis loves performing. The more they have fun, the bigger the tip, hopefully. Enjoy your time together tonight. - Hey. Ready? - Look at that cross your legs. - Oh! - Whoo! Get it, Stace. - Elvis is out, people. Huh! - I'm waking up early. - Good night, Kelly. - Mwah. - I'll see ya. - Good night, boo things. - Night. - Ems, you're way above this. - Well, I felt really bad 'cause I just, um, put something in the top of the bin and it dropped out. - Oh, gosh. I'd love to just spend the rest of the evening with Emily. - I empty trash bags for a living. - Yeah, it's a nice feeling. Unfortunately, yachts don't work like that. Emily's got me a little rattled, and, uh, I have high hopes for--for this date. I'm gonna hit the hay. - You're smiling. You can't stop smiling. Stop. I'm happy about, you know, tomorrow, 'cause I'm looking forward to... - Yeah? - Spend some time with Benjamin. I feel bad, 'cause... - Why do you feel bad? - Kelley wanted to take me out too. - Listen, this is the best thing for that situation, 'cause it's never gonna happen with Kelley and you, right? Never. I wouldn't even bring it up. - Ah, I get to plan a wedding, and you just have to say, "Yes, babe." - Yeah, like, okay. - I love it. - How'd you sleep? All right? - Yeah. - We should do breakfast in here 'cause it's very windy outside. - Okay, cool. - Would you like some eggs? - Love some eggs. Let me make some room. - You gonna let me throw him a bachelor party? - Okay, let's do this. Let's bring it up. - Copy. - Cap, we're moving over to 12:00 here. - Perfect. - Anchor's off the bottom, Cap. Anchor's off the bottom. - Roger that. Bring it up. - Mm, have you got it on? - Yeah, I want it on all the time. - I love that she has tiny fingers, 'cause then it makes it look so much bigger. - Good morning. - You look stunning this morning. - Thank you. You too. So, Kyle, is your family still in the U.K.? - I'm not very close to my family. I left home at 15 and 8 months. I signed the dotted line, said good-bye to my dad, and walked out the door and joined the army. - Why'd you be homeless? - No, no, no. And I'd be like, "Well, ladies and gentlemen, "at the end of the day, what's my favorite nation? A donation," you know? - Ay. - When did you decide, "You know what? I'm just gonna go to London and work as a performer?" - Wait, did she live on the streets with you? - No, no, she had a great job. She was the lead design-- - Why didn't she let you stay at her place? - This is so romantic. So you were homeless, trying to create a life in London for this girl? - Yeah. - I don't think Kyle's embarrassed about anything. I love it when people have no apologies for who they really are. It's refreshing. Wow, Kyle. - Let's go, Kyle. - I love you so much. - I've got to rock and roll. Be back in a sec. - Okay. - Right, where do you want me, on the bow? - Yeah, you're up on the bow. - I just want to stay here forever. - Pull that line up. - I'm on my mark right here. - I think we look pretty good right there. - Lock it off. - Nope, always do a figure eight. - Locked in, looking good. Good on the bow. - Go ahead and shut the mains down. - Deck crew, go ahead and start grabbing guest luggage. - Nice job, deck crew. Thank you. - Any time Captain Lee's happy with what the deck crew's done, that makes me very happy. - Sierra, we have to talk. - About what? - This is an intervention. - What's going on? - You have to give Kyle a chance. - Why? - He is courageous, generous, kindhearted. He's-- - So why don't you date him? - 'Cause I'm in love with Ro. He is real-life British Ryan Gosling. - He does look like him. Looks aren't, like, the end-all to end all for me. I'm more focused between what's a guy's ears than what's between his head and his knees. - The lengths he went for a girl he loves is mind-blowing. - Guess I'm gonna have to wait and see. - Attention all crew, attention all crew. I need everybody on the aft deck in 15. - Almost ready. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. - There she is. - I'm here. - I never had anybody wait on me. You're so nice. - Kelley. - It was a pleasure. - Great to meet you. - Definitely a pleasure. I had a great time. Thank you. - Put it here. Thank you for everything, buddy. Nice to see you in South Florida, man. - Thanks for everything. Being out on the water, snorkeling, getting engaged, you set up a great trip. - It's our pleasure. You guys were great. - You got a great crew, - It was so awesome. - And I really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - And that is to show my appreciation. - Oh. - Bye! Thank you. - Thank you. - Let's go to work. - Trip of a lifetime. - Thank you so much for taking me. I love you. - Do you know what I really want to do today? - What? - I wanna get drunk. You know, it's funny, unless I have a girl with me, I don't get wasted. If I have a girl with me, I try to get as wasted as possible. - I'm really ecstatic to go out tonight. I go, like, porn star when I'm drunk. - Really? - Oh, man. All I really wanna do is spend some time with Emily. And I was like, "Oh, it's on." - Attention all crew, attention all crew. I need everybody in the crew mess ASAP. - Copy. - I'm getting there. - Hey, I want to-- - Whoa. - Mm. - That's all the room you get. Is this table moving? 'Cause that's a new thing I've noticed. I always put my leg up. Clearly Kelley doesn't know yet Ben's asked me out on a date, because he's lounging on me. Bless him. - How we doing? Good. - So all in all, I think it went well. Interior, you guys just nailed it. Sweet. Exterior, we had some hiccups. - Oh, f---! - Coming up... - Are you upset at me? - No, I just don't want you playing with Kyle. You did not tell him the truth. - You shouldn't be judging me. Kelley, I'm not done talking to you. - Interior, you guys just nailed it. Sweet. Exterior, we had some hiccups. Okay, it might have been a good idea for us to be a little more proactive. - All right. Can do next time. - Okay. Let's get rid of some money. They tipped us 15 grand. That's $1,350 apiece. - 48 hours of work, $1,350 each. Very happy with that. Can't complain. - You guys can get busy flipping the boat. - What do you need? - You can go fishing for a couple of hours - Thank you. - And-- but I do expect you to make it up. You can go out to dinner tonight. - Sounds good. - Thanks, Captain. - Thank you. - Thanks, guys. - I need to charter a boat. Crackin'. Do you want to start getting ready? - Mm-hmm. - Maybe they are skinny. I'm very, very happy, that I'm going out with Sierra. I like fishing. I like nice women. So f---in' either way, I'm winning. - Pink is in. - I love that! - You're not going to a baby shower. You kids have fun. - Ems, he's not wearing that shirt. Burn it. - It's cute. - Let's do it. Come on, we're gonna miss the boat. We're late. Kyle. - Welcome aboard. Okay, let's go try to catch some fish. - Champagne. - Thanks so much. - Kyle! You better catch something! - Well, the aim of the game today is catch a bunch of fish. Let's have a load of fun. And then we'll go get some dinner, and then we'll meet up with everybody else. - Sounds good. - You happy with that? It's a deal. Sierra doesn't know what it's like to be romanced, so tonight, I'm pulling out all the stops, and she's having it. - Oh, I'm tired. - So do you know the plan for tonight? - Do I know the plan? - Yeah. - Well, I'm going to dinner with Ben. - With Ben? - Yeah, girl, you little cheeky sod. No to Kelley and yes to Ben, hey? - Who asked me first? - Well, that's true. - Kelley. - Ben. Kelley didn't already ask me anything. I said, "Oh, they're going on a date." He was like, "Oh, are they?" I said, "Yeah, they're going fishing." He was like, "Oh, we should go." He wasn't like, "Oh, let's go fishing tomorrow." Kelley is gonna flip. He really does like her, so I'm staying out of this. Like, I'm not gonna tell him. He can figure it out himself. - Two cool people... - Two cool people. Having a cool meal. - How are you feeling now? - Got your little throw. - Do you want to sit here? - Um...maybe. - Let's try. Let's try. - Probably not. - Let's try. Let's try. I'll sit on you. - No. - There we go. - Well... - Jump in. - No, I'm good. - Let me get my arm around you. - I'm great here. - That's fine. - Okay. - I'm happy with that. - This is fun. It makes me slightly uncomfortable the way Kyle is so persistent and adamant about being flirty. But for me, I thought it would be a cool opportunity for two adults to go and hang out and get to know each other outside of work. - Are you a fisherwoman? Do you love fish? - Yeah, I'll bait my hook. - Might bite the end off it. - No, f--- that. - Come on. - Or I could be in the hot tub, you know, doing some yoga, just like that. - Oh, you're that bored of me right now? - No, not bored at all. - Are we on? Oh, no. - No. - This is not the kind of fishing I expected. Where you going? - It's so late in the day. - Kelley? - Yeah! - I'm in here. - I'm coming in. No, don't. - So Ben's rooming with Kelley, and Kelley likes Emily. This is, like, a bad situation. - Hey, sporty, what's up? - Sh--, man. - Hey, can you plug in that iron? - F---. - Thanks, mate. - Oh, my God, I have Wi-Fi here. This is awesome. - Yeah. - There is, is there? - Yeah, there is. - I'm just gonna sip my wine over here by myself. - This is the best date ever. - Oh, it's fine. I'm a boat person. - How did the date go? - Well, she f---in'-- She was texting her f---in' guy friend the entire f---in' time. - What? - Yeah. - Why would she do that? Is that first time she's mentioned it? - Yeah. - And she waited for the date. Yeah. - My biggest belief in life is, no one can blame you for being honest. So if you're truthful, doesn't matter. If you're a liar, then it does matter. - Did she make you feel special at least? There you go, buddy. - Love you. - Never leave me. - How was it? - Did you have fun? - It was fun, yeah. It was good to be out on the water. - I have no idea. - I don't know. I wasn't texting my boyfriend, actually. - Yeah, dick--dick move. - It was fun. You're the meanest. Mm-hmm. - Oh, hello. - Ooh, yeah! - You don't want it too perfect. It's the Caribbean. - Do you want to get him? - I feel like he should--like, I don't feel like you should go get him for a date. - Yeah. - I'll get him. Ben, your lady is waiting in the main salon. - Oh. - Your lady? What lady? - Emily. They're going on a date. - Oh. What? Bro, like, I thought we were buddies, but you've just left me in the cold dark. - Hello. - Hey, how are you doing? - Good. - Good, good. - Yeah, you look great. After you. It's a very snazzy little dress you've got on. - Oh, thank you. - I'm really thankful for sharing time with Emily, to get away from all of the personalities and just have a really civilized, nice dinner. - Emily's going with him. - I do think it's a bit of a harsh move, though. - Mm-hmm. It's funny, because he goes through a girl every charter, for every charter season, different girl. - So it happened before? - Mm, every charter season he's been on. When did Ben get interested in Emily and Emily interested in Ben? This is like a fly ball to left field, and I'm sitting out there picking daisies. - Oh, dude, that would have pissed me the f--- off. - I'm still taking her for dinner. - You're still taking her for dinner? F--- that, bro. If she's texting-- texting a guy back home, why waste your time? Leave her here on the boat. You're just like me; you're just gonna end up getting hurt. I'm not gonna let Kyle get f---ed over, not now. Tonight, it--I just want it to be about the deck crew. - Okay. - Coming up... - I need, like, a grilled cheese before I go to bed. - God damn it. That's a fire hazard. That can go bad. I'm a bit worried about that. - What do you have there? - Someone left the toaster on. - And the hits keep coming. - It's very nice. After you, Em. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hello, good evening. - Good evening. - All right. Oof. - There we go with a wine. - Oh, perfect. Nice. Thank you. - Oh, thank you so much. - You're welcome. - I think I know exactly what I'm looking at. I'm very decisive. - I think you are, as well, after that speedy decision. - There's no pressure. You take your time. - Do you have any questions so far? - Oh, I've pretty much made my mind up. Okay, um, seared scallops, please. - Yes. - Okay. I would love to get the foie gras and the--okay, I'll get the scallops then. - Yeah, try that too? - Yeah, yeah. That would be awesome. Thanks. - Yeah, I generally think I'm on the f---in' road to nowhere there. - If she's sitting on a boat and texting her boyfriend back home-- - No, apparently wasn't. I just-- - No, she told me she was messaging her friend. - Yeah, yeah. - She said she was messaging a girlfriend. She's like, "What are you up to?" - Oh, it's a girlfriend now. I'm sorry, but she's lying to your f---in' faces. I'm sorry; she's got a boyfriend back home. If a girl texts while I'm taking her out to dinner, I will say, "Excuse me. I'm going to the bathroom," and then walk the f--- out of that restaurant. - Yeah. - Okay. - You tell her. - All right. - God, Kelley's being such a prick. - Why? - He was like, "Don't f---ing go out with a chick that's, like, talk-- you know, texting her boyfriend." - Kelley, just, like, doesn't know anything. - We're all going as a group. So we can go. Just don't sit next to Kelley. - All right, well, if Kelley's gonna be a dick, than I'll just leave. - I can taste the dill. You like dill, don't you? - I'm kind of a big dill. No, I'm just kidding. Um... I don't actually like dill that much. - You don't? - Dill has a time and a place. - Yeah. - This is really nice. - I value time one-on-one with people and also time on my own. It's what surprised people about especially taking this job. - What did--like, what did your folks say to that? - I mean, I'm always one to just plan things and go ahead and do it. They knew they wouldn't have been able to stop me. - Okay, so you're just very independent, right? - Yeah, I'm very independent. - Mm-hmm. - All in all, I wasn't happy, and I just changed my circumstances and--and became happy. It's nice spending one-on-one time together with someone. You know, we're getting to know each other more, and I know that I enjoy his company. It feels very easy and natural. What did your parents think of you starting yachting? - Oh, they were glad to get me out of the country. - Were they? - Hey. - Hi. Kelley, can I talk to you? - Sure. - Hey. - You all right? - Yeah. - Lauren said you're, like, upset at me. Are you? - No. No, I just don't want you playing with Kyle. - I didn't do anything to play with him. - Okay. - I couldn't have been more straight up, 'cause I feel like he... - Yeah, but his feelings-- - Doesn't understand. - No, I don't think he does. You did not put the point across well enough to him for him to understand. You did not tell him the truth. That's it. End of story. That's why I'm upset. - Telling the truth-- - So I-- - About telling the truth? - About telling the truth. - Oh, okay. Gotcha. - Yeah, keep smiling. - All right. Kelley, I'm not done talking to you. - I'm done. - I feel like we don't understand each other. - I'm done. - All right, well, I'm not going out with you guys. - Okay. She's drama. She's not coming out. - I don't feel like that'll be a fun time; I'm gonna stay here. - No, no, please come out. - Wait, wait, wait, wait... - No. No way I'm going. - Babe, you and me, let's f---ing go out. - We're not gonna have fun 'cause-- - This is, like, making more drama. Like, this is what he wants. - Making more drama? - Kelley. - Stop. - Stop. Go. - No, I'm just tired of her lying to him because she said-- - Kell-- - I'm not gonna be treated like this. I'm sorry. - Okay. F--- it. - Yeah, let's go to dinner. - I'm sorry, I'm not gonna sit there and let her lie to me. - I'll step out of it. Kyle got denied. It happens. Let's move on. - Let's go. - Jesus f---ing Christ. But now Kelley's causing the scene. He's way out of line, probably because Emily's out to dinner with Ben and so he's just lashing out on people. - No, no, really. - What's the problem here? - I told her she didn't tell Kyle that--that-- - It's--Kelley, it's really none of your business. - It is because it's affecting my crew. - No, no. - She didn't tell him-- when he's coming to me-- - You shouldn't be judging me. At all. - I'm not judging you. - I'm not doing anything that affects you. I've never been anything but nice to you. - Listen, he was just sticking up. You--nobody did anything wrong. - Guys, can we just go out to dinner? - You're barking up the wrong tree looking at me like that. - It's gonna be wonderful. - I'm sorry. I'll see you later. - No, no. I'm here. - No, I'm fine. - I'm waiting here. I'm waiting here. - Lauren, come. F---! - He's jealous because he just found out that Ben is going to dinner with Emily, very abruptly. - You good? - Yeah. - And he's taking it out on you and it's not fair and it's not right, but that doesn't mean you've done anything wrong. Jealousy's not a good look on anyone. You can't always get what you want. And part of growing up is learning how to handle rejection. And that's just not a life skill Kelley's mastered yet. - Well, she started this. She came up to me saying I was upset with her. - I'm going for you. Let me get dressed for a sec, okay? - What is it? - Three, two, one, go. - It tastes like cough syrup and ass. - Oh, it does. - You seemed slightly nervous yesterday when you were asking me out to dinner. - Well, I was because you could have said no. - It was a breath of fresh air for someone to actually verbally come and ask me out for a meal. - Did Kelley try and invite you out or something last night? - Kyle has this idea that we're going on a date tomorrow. Kelley's like, "Oh, you know, we should go." Emily is, like, all weirded out. Like, I don't know how to handle this. - I was very happy that you did, actually. - Well, I'm glad I did. - Yeah, no. - And I'm glad I'm sitting here and not Kelley. - So am I. - Oh, perfect. Emily's an absolute joy to talk to. She's very sophisticated, incredibly intelligent. It's nice to get to know her better. All right, we will-- I'll get the bill. - Cheers! - Cheers, mate. To Kelley not being here. - Oh, that's bad. I'm just kidding. - One shot. - Why does all your stuff taste like sh--? - Thank you very much for dinner. - Oh, no, you're welcome. Thank you. - You should know better. Like... - Yeah. Definitely. - Yours is a little bitch pussy. You have so much left over. - 'Cause mine's--look. 'Cause it's stuck. There we go. - Okay. - I don't know what we're walking into, so you might have to protect me. Yeah. - Uh-oh. - You can go to the table. I'm gonna use the loo. - Coming up... - I just have one issue. - What's that? - The pizza trail coming up the stairs leading into my quarters. - Things are out of control. - Deal with it accordingly. - I'm going to. - All right, are we ready, Em? - Yeah. - You can go to the table. I'm gonna use the loo. You want to go to the table together? - Wow. - Hi. - Hey. - Hello. - Ben and Emily going on a date did surprise me. I knew nothing of this. Like, what? We're roommates. Hello, bro. Yes! I'm so happy to see you guys. - How's it going, y'all? - Look who's here, Ben. - I see that. Hey, guys. - Kind feel like I got hit by a bus. Like, I hate, like, confrontations, and, like, Kelley and I got in an argument. Kyle apparently flipped out, and I think, like, to me, it just seems like a little bit, like, overbearing and expecting too much, like-- - Hi, I was wondering where you were. - Thank you. - Here, scoot in. - It wasn't the fact it was a date. I know you have someone back home that likes you. I felt like, I'm on a date with a girl, and she's giving interest back home while I'm with her. - I respect that. - And I always said that I think the sun shines out your ass, though. I think you're amazing. And it f---in' hurt me. - Well, I'm sorry. - That's how I felt. Let's just call it a day now, and let's just get on with our lives. - Okay, this is us getting on with our lives. - Oh, I feel better. - It's super awkward, like, you know, someone's emotional, someone's piss drunk, someone's trying to get to know someone else, someone's trying to diffuse a situation from earlier, and I'm stuck in the middle of all this emotions, and I'm like, "I'm gonna order a pizza, and I'm gonna go home." I'm gonna pay for the pizza and take it in a box to go. - Sure. - F---. - I just hope this guy back home is really what you need. - I hope he looks after you. Time and effort is what you need. - I can't believe I'm not paying for this. - I genuinely do believe that every woman deserves the best, but when she acts the way she acts, she's never gonna have that. I'm gonna be nice, but deep down, it's like... For some f---ing miracle Sierra comes knocking, the door will be locked. Once bitten, twice shy. - Grilled cheese sandwich, okay. Let's do it. Cheese, everything. - What kind? Everything. - Give me that sh--. No. - No. - You didn't even see what I got in there. - No, girl, I've got your sh--. I'm gonna eat your pizza. You think you're cute, but you ain't getting that sh--. - Kyle, come over here for a second. - Oui. Agree. - Cut out early. - Actually, we should just leave now. What about that? - Go, go. Move, people, move. - I'm fine with Ben and Emily, but it's not something I want to see tonight. Screw this day. Kelley's gonna have a fun night. - Where did they go? Oh, gone off. Cheers. - Cheers. - I had a really good time tonight. - I did too. - No, I honestly did. - Did you? - Yes! - I just have one issue. - What's that? - Pizza trail leading into my quarters, yeah. - Well, we don't need to live in filth. - I don't appreciate it. - Thank you for showing me. - If the captain is finding half-eaten pizza on the way to his cabin, things are out of control. - I accept the fact that you'll deal with it accordingly. - I'm going to. - Yeah, f--- the system! Ugh! - God damn it. F---. Oh, sh--. That's a fire hazard. - No, no. That can go bad. I'm a bit worried about that. - What do you have there? - Someone left the toaster on. - And what's wrong with it? - Uh, it's just smoking a bit. - Are you joking? - No, I don't think he's joking. And the hits keep coming. - I finally have the captain calmed down, and could not be worse timing. You don't run in front of the captain with a boat bomb in your hands. - The mistakes that they're making could be a lesson that they would never forget. - I will tell them that. Nico. - Yeah. - I'm asking you what the situation was. - The sandwich maker was on. - I honestly wasn't here. If I knew who it was, I would tell you right now. - And that's it. - Hey. - Dude. - Where have you been? - Yeah. - Yeah. Talk legit. - Excuse me, you need to realize that we're talking about a safety thing. I'm sorry to interrupt. - No, that's okay. No, no, it's okay. - Yeah. - Nico? - No, no. - Who do you think you guys are? I'm a pretty generous chief stew. Everyone makes mistakes. But if you're gonna be rude to me, I'm gonna be less forgiving. - It was kind of nice to find pizza laying on the floor going up to my quarters. - It's pretty embarrassing. - We cannot find you. We cannot find Sierra. - What happened was, I'm cleaning the crew mess, 'cause I just-- - Why are you cleaning the crew mess right now? - Do you know what just happened? No. Exactly. - I'll show you the photo. And then I was talking to Nico about what happened to the grill, and it was like, "Lauren, right now, we're having an incident report. I want to know, was it plugged in?" And she's like, "No, no." - We'll talk about it. Kate's trying to throw me under the bus in front of the captain. So it was a little bit of a dick move, yes. Yeah? - Ben's very good at reading signals, and he's very respectful. And I feel like there's genuine feelings there. - Before tonight, I really didn't know much about Emily, and there was no real chemistry between us. And--and I feel there is now, and I hope that we can continue this. - Oh, hi. - The skillet was on me. The pizza, I don't know who that was. - I know who it was. - Here's the thing, Kate. There's been times where we've cleaned up on deck that hasn't been always us. - That's not exactly what bothered me the most. I don't mind doing it. I don't like how when there's a safety issue, Lauren-- - At the same time, though, Nico handled it. He took the skillet out. - It was a dangerous situation. - Still to come this season on "Below Deck"... - Surprise! - Whoo! We're sorry. - I came out to my father to this song. - Whoa, we're both gay? To me, it's weird. Like, he felt so hurt by me. You're a queen. - F--- off. - Emily is the jewel of the Caribbean. - The poor connection me or you? It's hard to manage a full-time relationship with someone on land in a different country. - It's a lot. - I'm really just asking whether you think Ems and I can work out. - No. - Somebody we all know and love. - Hello, Dean. - It just didn't have-- didn't have a lot of flavor. - It's the only dish that has ever been sent back. - I don't know what Ben's been doing. His head is not in the game. - Kate can go f--- herself. The root of all evil on this boat is Kate. - Do you think we're not working hard enough? - I'm wasted. - Whoa. - Oh, sh--. - This is not your personal f---ing party palace. - Do you expect her to just stand in front of them all day long? - Kate, Ben, I can hear you guys on the bridge. - I don't like working with you anymore. - You know what? Guess what. - Don't come at me. Tell me. - I can come at you however the f--- I want. - When I leave this boat, I'm not talking to you anymore. - Just stirring the pot. - If you don't want to go to your happy, groovy place, you can go make beds and clean the toilets. - God damn it! - My ass is about to be handed to me, and it might be the last time. - What I'd like to do is rip your f---in' head off. - Nico just got promoted to boatswain. - What? Oh, dear.
