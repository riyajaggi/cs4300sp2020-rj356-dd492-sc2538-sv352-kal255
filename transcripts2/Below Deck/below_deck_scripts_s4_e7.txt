 - Previously on "Below Deck"... - Nice to meet you. You do realize that, though, I find you very attractive? - I think it's wild. I don't know if it's just a switch you can just flip. - You and I both look out the same windows and we see the same dirt. How come nobody's taking care of it? I'm willing to go out on a limb  and give him a second shot. Just to show you  that it's not on the inside. I want it done.

 - Is this our anniversary today?  - Yeah. Made it to our first week. This is like awkwardly romantic. - I know something's wrong. I know her energy.  I know her so well. - Well, she likes you, man. - You know I don't  want anything to change. We work really well. - It's a bit of  a smack in the face to know that you've  just been "friend-zoned." - Would I be wasting time  with Emily? - I mean, I would give it a go. - I'm gonna sweep her  off her feet and she's not gonna know  what f---ing hit her.

 - Surprise!  - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God, Ben is, like, hating his life right now. - It's great. It's awesome. I need to cool off. ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ - You are burnt  on your back there. - Am I?  - Yeah. - Is that sunscreen?  Oh, thank you. Is it bad? - Little bit. - Pick it up, center-fielder. - Hi. - Has anybody caught your eye or have you got someone back home? - Mm, I don't have anyone. I don't really know  how to deal with this one. It's taking me by surprise. - Where have you guys been? - What do you want to drink, babe? - I don't know. What do you want? - You all right, bro? - Yeah, I've got to, um... - Okay. - Some of the relationships  I've had in my past, I knew that I wouldn't  end up with that person. And the older you get,  time is of the essence. So I should probably take it  a little bit more seriously and actually meet someone that I can see myself with. ¶ ¶ - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yes. - Glad you're here. - Look, I can make a pussy and a heart together. - Shh. - Absence makes  the heart grow fonder, or it doesn't. - Oh, baby girl. - And for us, it has. Romance is definitely  in the air. You know, Kate's got Ro. Kyle's just having a field day  with Sierra. And, you know, here I am  with my good friend Nico. - Why? - He's lovely, but I'm not attracted to him in that way. - I think she thinks  I'm a muscle-head. - Yeah, but she's  definitely interested. - He's obviously absolutely gorgeous and-- - He is! He's like a freaking superhuman. - But he is not my type. - She's from the south, mate.  - Oh. - She's a Londoner.  - Oh, a Londoner. - And she's from Northwest London; she's very f---ing posh. - Hello. - What are you thinking about,  about... No, it's great. It's a beautiful thing. I love it.  - Well... - See, I think it's the biggest compliment in the world. - Well, maybe, you know, if we're not meant to be together, she's done with men. - All right.  Y'all ready? - Let's do it. ¶ ¶ - Hi, how are you? Thank you. ¶ ¶ - There's no invite to that. You know, sell me a ticket. - And we live on it, guys. - Things with Ro  got intense real fast. I think anybody who's ever fallen in love knows  that the first three months are just like  you can't get enough. ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ - I'll help.  - You do the healthy sh--. - Okay.  - And I'll do the gunk-- junk stuff. - We should get one of these. - I don't want it. - But why? - Kelley, Kelley; Lee. Can I get you  up at the bridge, please? - Yes, sir.  Heading your way now. ¶ ¶ - Just wanted to go over a couple of things with you. Try to keep in your mind to--to be a little bit more proactive. 'Cause your crew's gonna follow your lead. - Yeah. - So if you're just sitting down in the crew mess, waiting for me to tell you what to do, they're gonna sit down in the crew mess waiting for you to tell them what I tell you.  - Yeah. - Go to the charter guests after they get settled in and find out what they want to do. It's a good skill to develop. - No, that's fine.  Yeah, I can definitely do that. - I don't get overly impressed  with somebody just doing what they're supposed to do. I get impressed with somebody  going beyond what they're supposed to do. Just a little bit more proactive. - Can do.  - Thanks, Kelley. - No problem, Captain. Oh, f--- me. - Did you see Ro today? - Yes.  They both slept on the boat. - In a cabin, yeah?  - Yeah, I guess a cabin. - They're a noisy couple. - Nice. I'm sure you like to hear that. - Hey, guys.  - Oh, I would love it. - Hello.  - Ro's leaving. - Aw.  - Buh-bye. - Good to meet you. - Hey, babe.  - Hey, love. - It was great to meet you. - Very nice to meet you. Wow, look at all this. So you are talented  at something. - I can do one thing. Meeting Ro was a little odd. But honestly, I'm happy  if Kate's happy. Seriously. - Bye, Kyle. - That's the real deal.  - Mwuah. - Ciao.  - Be good. - You too. Bye. - Take care of this one, yeah?  - I will. I'll look out for her.  - Thanks. - It's always hard to  say good-bye to Ro. It's hard to say good-bye  to Ro on FaceTime. So in person,  it's more difficult. - All right, homegirl.  - See you, bye. Let me see that bag. Ha, oh, you're leaving things  behind, huh? - Uh-huh. I won't be seeing Ro in person until after the season's over  and I fly back. But at least we had this  little midpoint check-in. - One more?  - Mm-hmm. - One more? - That might have been  the best night of sleep I've had in  at least three weeks. - Good-bye, baby girl.  - Bye. - Bye. Ta-ta for now. - Kelley, Kelley; Lee. Your latest project has arrived. - Roger that. Nico and Kyle to the dock,  please. This thing's gonna be heavy.  It's the slide. I hate slides. Oh, Jesus.  Ready? Oh. Oh, I hope I never have to set  this f---ing thing up again. I'm gonna go into  this positive and say I'm gonna whoop that  mother----er's ass. That's a big f---ing box. - Wait.  - Is he out the door? F---ing f---! - There it is. Casualty number one. - All right, three, two, one. - Ow!  - Again? - Right, this f--- is gonna-- - I'm quitting.  I'm out of here. That slide changed my life. I f---ing banged me head,  me legs, me hands. Just a pain in the ass. - Down. All right, now we got to get it strapped around this  mother----er. - Let's pick it up.  I'm gonna go get the davit. - Wait a minute, Kelley. The best thing we can do  with this thing right now is unfold it here on the dock, because we don't have any room  up there to unroll it. - Roger that. Just dump 'er  and open 'er up. Ready?  One, two, three. - See anything that looks like  any paperwork or anything yet? - Pump.  Repair kit. There's our lifting harness. - That's good. Yep, yep. - All right,  back up for a sec. - Kelley, for deployment, this is gonna have to be  out of the way. Come on over a little bit,  Kelley, to the right.  - Yes, sir. Captain holds me  to high standards, but he's also trying to micromanage the sh-- out of me. Is it frustrating as hell?  F--- yeah. Awesome.  - Little bit more. - Roger that. ¶ ¶ - What's up?  - Nothing, I'm just thinking. So how'd you get into boats?  - I was in the army. And then I got into fishing trawlers and yachts. So how long have you been in yachting now? - Three months. - And how old did you say you were? - I'm 27.  - 27... - Yeah. What? I'd love to take you on a date with me. - Okay.  Yeah, that'd be cool. You're nice. Cool. Dinner? Let's do it. Which... I love fishing and I love food. - So, like, I'm either getting  a free meal... - Up top. - Or a fishing trip.  - Free meal? - Yeah.  - So I'm paying for dinner? - That's what  "take you out" usually means. - Oh, I--I thought you were gonna pay for me, but I don't really care; cool.  - Oh. Kyle's definitely  an entertaining guy, even if I don't understand  every word he says. We'll go Dutch.  - No. I'll pay for dinner.  - That's your steez, right? Belgian? - Belgian's Flemish, but okay. - Coming up... - What the hell? - Ems, do you want a cup of tea? - Yes, please.  Thank you. - You know,  they could be really cute. What kind of tea  did you make her? - I made her green tea with acai. - Wow; you guys can have  after-dinner tea together too. - Yeah. Uh--yeah, yeah. - Yeah, go walk down  to the dock. - Yeah?  - Yeah. - Okay. Sierra? - Yes.  - Just get my shoes on, okay? Soon as I get a paycheck  it's going straight to her. Let's go. I took her out on a date... - It's Valentine's Day tomorrow.  - It is. - What you gonna do? - I always have really  bad luck on Valentine's Day. What are you sending money home for? - My daughter. - Oh.  - Yeah. - I didn't know you had one. - Didn't you?  - Mm-mm. So why aren't you guys together? - 'Cause it might--  it's just the way it is. But she'll never have a work--  have to work again. I'll make sure of that. - I think it's so noble for Kyle to want to provide  for the mother of his child, but, like, it's kind of  a red flag. How old is she? - I don't like to say--  'cause it turns people off a little bit.  - In what way? - Well, if you're trying to,  like, get to know a girl and when they found out you got  a kid, it's like "Whoa!" - It's a lot of pressure.  - Yeah. - Yeah. So how old is she? - Oh, wow. ¶ ¶ - Kate, Ben, Kelley,  I need all of you in the crew mess for  a preference sheet meeting. - Roger.  - Copy. - Let's go, sports fans. All right, Steve Haug and Rachel Belmont are the primaries. - They're a--attractive couple. This looks like a  "Dancing with the Stars" posing photo. - He's a financial planner. He wants this trip with his friends to celebrate "life and Valentine's Day." So Frank is their best friend. Gail is a business partner turned friend. And her daughter, Madison, is coming with. And Steve wants to surprise Rachel by proposing on the first night of the charter so they can celebrate the whole trip.  - Wow. - Don't you think he should  do it the second night because it might ruin the trip  if she says no. - That's not my call.  - Oh, okay. - But we should have a contingency plan. In case she does. - Lifeboats. How did you propose  to your wife, Captain Lee? ¶ ¶ - I just asked her if she wanted to marry me. Anyhow, back to the preferences. Hey, do you want sushi?  - Yes, thank you. ¶ ¶ - Wow, that salmon looks amazing. - What a feast. - Rainbows are so in  in 2016. - I think it's a very  free-spirited outlook. I think it's incredible. - Thanks, babe. - I mean, I like women as well. I mean, I don't blame her,  to be honest. I would be a big, big lesbian  if I could. Given the chance. Okay, that's looking  fine and dandy. Good night. ¶ ¶ - Happy Valentine's Day, Emily. - Did you get any messages?  - No. - No?  - What about you? - No. - So you don't have a valentine is what you're saying? - I don't have a valentine, no. - We might have to change that. - I'm trying to signal, "No, don't ask me out, please." ¶ ¶ Christ, what the hell  happened here? It's rude. I don't want to get up  and see that crap. - Hello.  - Hi. So laundry's being turned over.  - Yes. - Oh, we've got some wine  in the main salon that I think we should  just divide. - Okay. - Uh, did you call anybody  for Valentine's Day? - Sent a couple messages to friends and things. - Yeah?  - Don't have a valentine. - What?  - I know. ¶ ¶ - I just talked to Emily. She said no one's ever sent her flowers ever. Wouldn't it be nice if somebody on the crew gave her flowers? - That would be lovely. - I have a flower order coming. You want me to add to it? - I would like that.  - Okay. I think maybe you could do a little bit of yellow, with, like, maybe some light pink in there 'cause it's like, "we're friends, but there could be something going closer to red." - Mm, I don't want  to scare the poor girl. - Oh, I don't think she'll be scared. - Oh. - I think she'll be super flattered. - Really?  - Yeah. I've seen the kind of girls  Ben likes to date. They're always much younger  and very thin. So I think the fact that  Emily is also intelligent and has a nice  British upbringing makes her perfect. - Cheers. - Kelley, Kelley; Lee. - Go for Kelley. - I need you to come up  to the dining area and clean up some leftover food.  - Roger that. - I'm not your mother. I'm not gonna  clean up after you. - How the f--- is the sushi  the deck crew? Because that was  Ben, Kate, Emily, and me. - Oy. - Off who? - Lee, for the sushi, for leaving the sushi out. ¶ ¶ - Kate, Kate, you have  a delivery on the dock. - Thank you. ¶ ¶ Ben, the eagle has landed. - What? - We're gonna make them look not so cheeseball. - I don't know.  - What's the matter? - I think maybe there should be  a little bit of baby breath between the roses.  - What? You seem a little nervous, Benji. we have 30 minutes till guests' arrival. 30 minutes till guests' arrival. ¶ ¶ - I'm not sure if it's a presumptuous position  for me to be the first one to ever give her flowers. - Here we go, sports fan. - But I'm gonna do it anyway. I think this is rock and roll. - Hi.  Happy Valentine's Day. - Oh, my gosh, it's so big. - Where is Ben? - Uh. - Ben, get up here now. - After you, my love. - It's so pretty. ¶ ¶ - I am so excited. - Coming up... - The wind's going one way; The current's going  the other way. What are you doing?  This is f---ing embarrassing. - I'm on my way down.  It's not that goddamn tough. - Where is Ben? - I am so excited. - I'm--no, I'm not gonna say it.  - I'm still late. - Hi.  - How you doing? - I'm Rachel.  - Rachel, I'm Captain Lee. - Nice to meet you. - How are you? - Steve.  - Hi, welcome Rachel. - Hi, I'm Gail.  - Madison. - Kelley.  - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you, Lauren. - Happy Valentine's Day  to everyone. - Ooh.  - Happy Valentine's Day. - We're gonna get underway rather quickly so I'm gonna have Kate, she'll give you a tour of the boat. - Let's do it.  - Right this way, guys. So this is our main salon. We have a formal dining table.  - Oh, wow. - And now we'll go on to the master suite first. It's a really beautiful boat.  It just got refitted, so everything's new.  - Beautiful. - And then,  your master bathroom is here. The best part of this bathroom  is the robot toilet. I like to call it  "R2-Poo2." - And this is the sun deck. This is our Jacuzzi  with a nice view. Very nice.  - Yeah, real cool. - We're bigger than those boats.  - We are. - We make them  look like our bitches. - We're f----ing crushing it. ¶ ¶ - Oh. What the hell? It's so sweet. I was totally shocked. It really touched my heart. And I felt that feeling  when you can't take a smile off your mouth. Wow. - I need a hidden conversation  with you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hi. - Did you want to do it in front  of your friends or in private? - Yeah, yeah.  - Yes? Okay. Set up candles;  we've got roses. Be a little bit romantic?  - Awesome. - Yeah.  - Also, the ring is in my backpack in a sock.  - Okay. - If someone could get it  from my backpack and give it to Frank?  - Sure, okay. - Yeah.  - Awesome, this is exciting. - Happy Valentine's Day. I'm gonna have to-- everybody's gonna have to share. - Ben. - How's it going? - That was amazing.  I loved it. - Happy Valentine's Day. - Thank you.  - What happened? - Well, you're welcome. - Some blue roses  in my bed. - Aw. This guy. - I surprise people sometimes. - One of the main things  I was surprised about is how a gesture like that can change  your feelings about someone. I'll be smiling all day. - That's what I wanted, so, perfect. - Thank you. - I just couldn't believe it, so I had to do it. - Everybody in position. - Kyle's in position. - Em's in position. - Roger that. We'll go bow to stern. Bow to stern. - The ring is in  his backpack in a sock. When you find that,  give it to me, yeah. Okay, they're out.  - Gonna go? - Yeah. - Thanks, man.  Stern's all clear. All lines clear, Captain. ¶ ¶ - I'm--I'm so old;  it's insane. - All right, let's do this.  - Roger that. ¶ ¶ - How many people get to  experience something this amazing?  - No, I agree, it's beautiful. - I'll tell you right now,  I am definitely jumping off  the top of this boat. - Let's check it out. - Sierra, I'll never  find another third stew quite like you. - If you would be  my laundry girl? - I don't think I can commit to that. - It's damn--  it does look good on me. This ring is huge, but gorgeous. - There's your future. - It feels so right. So obviously I'm gonna  go give this to somebody else. - Okay. - On my mark,  give me two shots. Lock it into deuce. - She's not gonna  go in any of these drawers so we can put it in here.  - This is good? - Yeah, that's fine.  - Okay. - There's a bunch of flowers  on my bed. Blue roses. - Who are they from?  - Guess. - Is it Kyle? - No.  - Ben? - Yeah.  - No. - I'm so happy. How cute. - Hey, Ben, the guests  are at the table. - Just give me one second, please. ¶ ¶ Seared ahi, spicy mayo. - Okay.  - Cheers. - Here we have seared ahi tuna, sushi rice, spicy mayonnaise,  and sweet glass noodles. - Cool.  - Beautiful. - This is amazing. - Oh, my God,  they are unbelievably good. - Oh, beautiful.  - Spicy lobster salad. - Love it. He's not playing around.  - No. - That's fire. - Get under there and untie it now. - I've been doing this  long enough now that I know the guests usually  just want all the toys. Let it go a little bit longer. Let it go, let it go. No, no, no. So you want proactive, Captain? All the toys are going out. Give it about 15 seconds longer. - So you guys are gonna snorkel too? - Mm-hmm.  - Awesome. - Are you--  - I'll probably not. - Hi, guys, how's it going?  - Good. - Love to do some snorkeling.  - Snorkel? Yeah, want to get in the water? - Yeah.  - All right, awesome. I'll check with everyone else.  We'll get that set up for you. - Awesome.  - Thank you. - You ready? - That's one. All the way down. - Control it.  Controlled pull-up. - How many's going? - Um, they all want to go. - I'll take Kyle.  - Yeah. - So what are we doing? - What are the plans, Stans?  - I don't know. - Let's just give 'em goggles  and put 'em in the hot tub. - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. - Hey, you guys know  if we're going out soon? - Yeah, do--do you want to go snorkeling? - Yeah.  - When? Right now? - Yeah.  - All right, we'll get the boat pulled around.  - Cool. - Oh, sh--. - Good lunch, Ben.  The guests are so happy. - That's awesome. Now, for the most important dinner in the world... Apparently. The proposal-- do you think a red velvet cake, like a red, yeah.  - Oh, good idea. - Yeah. - Red, and it's Valentine's Day. - Yeah.  - All the rest of it. - Do you think she's gonna cry?  She might cry. - She's not in love if she doesn't cry. Let's do--let's say that. - So you're staying here?  - Yeah, yeah, yeah. We just got to let  the pool off of it. - We got to let the pool  slide out to the side. That way, once I'm alongside, you can just hand 'em over to me. Nico, just under your corner,  let it swing out. Then attach that yellow line  to the port aft corner. - With the current,  it's not gonna work this way. - So we're trying to get  the Intrepid in so we can line it up for the guests to  come onboard for snorkeling. But the pool  is just in the way. - Kelley, you ready? - Just got to wait. I got it. - That means he's serious. - The wind's going one way, the  current's going the other way. And, you know,  it's a recipe for disaster. - There you go. - This thing is  a pain in the ass, isn't it? - Kelley's like, maybe if we,  like, ram the tender into the pool  and push it out the way, it'll happen,  but every time he pulled back, the pool just quickly swung in. - Go ahead, back out of there,  Kelley, as soon as she gets it loose. - The guests are  standing there watching us, and we're like. ¶ ¶ - I'm on my way down. - Oh, God, just let me  do this alone. Here we go again with  Captain Lee, micromanaging. - Jesus Christ, could f--- up  a two-car funeral. It's not that goddamn tough. - Coming up... - I'd like to, uh, make a little toast. - Aw. - This could either be  really good or really bad. - Rachel... - Just go ahead and back out of  there, Kelley, as soon as she gets it loose. - Yeah, she's got it  all tangled up. - Never mind.  I'm on my way down. - I don't need you  a part of this right now. - F--- up a two-car funeral. - F---ing terrible idea. - Okay, what you need to do is pay attention to what this is doing. You got to adapt to whatever's happening in the water. - Yes, sir.  - Kelley, bring it in starboard side two, you have plenty of room. - Okay, Cap. - He didn't bring the bow line in tight, so then the pool got wedged between the boat and the thing. Go ahead, bring it in. - F---.  - Take it around again. - Yeah.  - Take that line up here. - I think Kelley's  feeling the pressure. He's constantly having  his progress evaluated. You know, he puts  that pressure onto us when Captain puts that on him,  and that's sort of how the ranking trickles. - Why do you keep leaving  the bow lines out like that? And now you got so many  wrapped, you can't control it. - Get that bow tighter.  - Come on. We really don't look like  seasoned professionals. They teach you how to do that  in the Navy? You need some lessons  in line handling. We look more like the Keystone Kops meets  the Three Stooges. - Let's get people down here  and get 'em moving so they can enjoy  some of this day. - Yes, sir.  - Give me your radio. I want you pushing the pool off. Kelley, turn your wheel starboard. Get the stern off. And take it forward. Get it up. - Bye.  - Bye. - Finally. - Are you guys leaving me? - Oops. - Run back in the same way  you did before, Kelley. - Roger that. What are you guys doing? I've worked on big boats  and I've never really seen such a sh-- show. - Line up.  - Ah. - There you go.  - Thank you. - You're good. - That was f---ing embarrassing. - Is that smoke? - F---. That is really bad. Sh--e. - Did you know that  Kyle has a daughter? - You don't know?  - No, I didn't know. - Yeah, I knew on the first day.  - Literally, had no one-- said anything to me. I had no idea. I'm not gonna say it put me off, like... - But?  - It's a lot of pressure. - Well, understandably, yes. - So, defogging their masks,  yours goes last. Be careful, go--watch this. ¶ ¶ Keep an eye on the guests. ¶ ¶ Worst day ever. Why does everything  backfire on me? Being proactive backfires on me,  I mean, it just-- this charter season  is kicking my ass. - Time to put this bad boy to bed. Hang on, Nico,  we'll get you in. The pool's coming in. - Thank you, bosun. You're gonna go  on a snorkeling trip, and we're gonna have fun  putting away the pool. I mean, the guests  didn't ask for it. They didn't use it. So thanks a lot, pal. - Whoo! I need some more  lead in my pencil. ¶ ¶ - Motor, yacht "Valor,"  motor, yacht "Valor," I'm about five minutes out  with the guests. - Copy, thank you. - Nico and Lauren, can you get on the, uh,  aft deck to help get the guests off? - All right.  Copy that. - The pool's up! Just watch your head  when you step up. All right, man. - Thank you, sir.  - No worries. - You looking forward  to getting off again? - Yeah, I am. Hopefully no drama and no one gets attitude. - I know. And Kyle and, um,  Sierra are going on a date. - Are they?  - Yes. They're going fishing  over dinner. - Fishing?  - Yes. - We're going. - Do you want to go on a date with me? I want to go fishing. - Fishing's not really my thing. - Yeah. - I feel bad because I know that Kelley  has feelings for me, and I don't want to hurt him. And I don't want this  to affect our friendship. But I like Ben; I clearly  get on very well with him. It's slightly awkward. - All right, I got to get back there and help them. I'll chat with you in a bit.  Enjoy your break. - Thank you. I'll try not to fall overboard. ¶ ¶ - This is like the witching hour right now. I've actually never cooked  a proposal dinner before. So it's actually a little bit  nerve-wracking. Can you imagine if  she said no because I overcooked her steak  or something? ¶ ¶ - Oh, that's awesome.  - They did a great job, huh? - Thank you so much.  - I'm so excited. I just got goose bumps.  It's so exciting. There is so much love  everywhere. The charter guests  are celebrating love. The crew members are in love. It's Valentine's Day. Ah--it's just too much. - He got to practice on me.  - Yeah. - I said yes.  - I was practicing with him before. - Oh that's--that's really cute. - 'Cause I--I haven't  said it out loud yet. I haven't, like, gone  through it all, so I was like, "I need to practice on you."  - That was smart. - Hope--hopefully I'm not a mumbling idiot. Who's Ryan? He just wanted to talk, I guess. So we could hang out. - But you're going  fishing with him? - He says it's on.  He's like, "We can go to dinner after  if you want." I was like, "Yeah, we can totally go to dinner." - You could, like,  barbeque on the beach. - It's just dinner. In my mind,  it's not a date. I don't want  to make it a big deal. I just want to  go and hang out and get to know each other. He doesn't even know me yet. I could--have two heads. You know, for all he knows. - No, but it's nice he actually came and spoke to you though. That he's wanting to court you. - Oh, Rachel, come sit by me.  - Okay. - Sit next to the boys. - Wait, are you a lefty? - I love that you colored it  red. - Love is in the air. - Come on, let's not get too,  you know... - You've been infected by the love bug. - Babe--just--come on. I think being in love  takes a certain maturity. And I think I'm  getting to the point where this could  actually happen. And I look forward to it  because apparently, it's a really  warm, fuzzy feeling. - You ready?  - Filet mignon. Uh, red wine demi glace with a beetroot puree. Thank you. - Filet mignon,  beetroot puree. ¶ ¶ - Okay, appreciate it. Thanks, love. - Here we are.  My pleasure. - Aw, in a heart. - Looks amazing. - Oh, my gosh,  this is so good. - Mmm. ¶ ¶ - I'm scared. This could either be  really good or really bad. - I'd like to, uh, make a little toast. - Aww.  - For everyone. First, today was, like, one of the best, most memorable days of my life. I like to really just soak it in and just know how fortunate I am. It's a lot of the little things, like, I know I wake up in the morning and give my girlfriend a kiss. And I want to keep those days going. Hopefully for the rest of my life. With that being said, Rachel. Um... - Coming up... - You're a man. You're a man.  - All right. All right, ready? Ready, champ? - Mm. Hello, Emily, how are you?  - Hello. - First, today was, like, one of the best, most memorable days of my life. I want to keep those days going. So with--with that being said... - Oh, my God. - Rachel-- let me get on my right-- - Yes.  - Will you marry me? - Yes. ¶ ¶ - He's crying; she's crying.  - Aww. - The guests are crying. - Is this real? - So cute. Aww.  - It makes me so happy. - There's just so much  love in the air. This story is a story  they're gonna tell their friends when they get home, their parents  when they get home. When their children ask  how he proposed, their grandchildren; this day is gonna be  talked about for a long time. - Oh, my God,  I love you. - Yeah, don't worry about that.  - That's tomorrow--tomorrow. - Yeah? - That'll be fun. Let's go on a double date! Dude, f--- yeah,  we can go fishing. Have you ever been fishing?  It's so fun. I'm not nervous, I think, if Kyle and I went by ourselves. I just thought if Emily  and Kelley would come along, it would take a little bit  of the, like, heaviness out of the vibe. Think about it, girl. - Crew? - Who is it?  - No one's here! No one's here. - What are you guys doing? We're watching the video.  - Just chilling. - You're coming? - Huh?  - What are you talking about? - To be fair, isn't that my choice? - Why?  - Since I was the that in-- that's paying for the  f---ing thing, though. - Can't they come?  - Why don't you guys go? All three of you go,  have a f---ing triple date. Can't believe this sh--. - I heard you guys wanted to go. - When?  - I got to go. - I think it'd be fun. - Why don't you all  go in her room, yeah? Have a double date in there. - I mean, I wouldn't mind  going fishing. - Yeah, I know.  - But it's your date. - Yeah, it's your date.  - That's what I'm thinking. - Why don't you do something else on the same night and you could even fish together  and then do your own thing. - I don't know, we just have  a lot to do on the boat. - So you're both  gonna go fishing? It's a bit concerning that  you guys are just gonna go f--- off while me and Lauren  have to clean the boat. Uh, that's not really fair. - Good night, Frank.  - Good night, guys. - Good night, Frank. - Oh, yeah, I got it. - Ooh. What my baby wants,  my baby gets. Oh, my God.  It's so cute. - Ooh.  - Ah. - Mm.  - I love you. - I love you. - Things are starting  to feel a little weird. It makes me slightly  uncomfortable the way Kyle is so persistent. I don't understand, like,  why it's expected that it's gonna be this, like,  full-blown romantic thing. - Jokes... - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. It's fine. - No, no, no.  - I just think like the more the merrier.  - All right, okay. No, no, no, it's fine.  I'll think about it. - I totally think it's really cool that they're going fishing and everything, but, like, do it on your own time. You know, if it is  all four of 'em gone, like, they shouldn't expect us... - To do, like, a full wash down. - To carry on  because they have plans. Whatever. - Shake some booty. - What would your dwarf name be? There's Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Happy, Grumpy, Bashful.  - Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy. It depends what mood I'm in.  Right now I'm sleepy. - Yeah. Grumpy, Bashful,  - Bashful, Grumpy. I'm a little bashful  right now, to be honest. - What?  - Well, because... - Emily? - Well, yeah, I'm thinking about taking her out to dinner. - You're bashful around her? That's a very good sign. - How you gonna do it? - I feel like  a young schoolgirl. - Aw, that's so romantic.  - I know. - You should just use that on her. - "Hey, Emily, you make me  feel like a young schoolgirl." - Yeah. - I am a little nervous  about asking Emily out. It's been many years since  I have asked an English rose  on a date. Actually, I don't even think  I've ever done it before. So, yeah, nerve-wracking stuff. - Hey, by the way. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah? - What? - What are you, scared? - I just told you I was bashful; was that not enough? - Don't overthink it. - Well, now you're scaring me. I was gonna ask her anyway, and now you're pressurizing me to.  - No, I'm not. - Kate, I just need to digest this one by myself. - Okay.  - But I appreciate it. - Okay. - I really do, I appreciate it. - Good.  - Thank you. - Bye. - I'm not going to bed.  - I'm--going away. - Huh? Kate?  - What? - That whole  "if she says no" speech... - I was just being sarcastic.  - That--no--that-- oh, that was great. - Take it outside, take it out.  - Because then maybe... - Take it outside.  - Well, because then maybe-- - You started it.  - Why would you do that to anyone?  - Are you being sarcastic right now?  - No, I'm being-- - You used to be--  - I'm actually--I'm curious. - You actually--  - Yell it; just yell it. - She knows she's gonna go. It's always--it's always going to happen... - How does she know--  she's gonna go? - She know-- 'cause she likes you. - Just look at her, she's--  she's like--in there-- she's in there  like Cinderella, like, ¶ One day my prince  will come ¶ - All right, fine.  - Do some jumping jacks. Get the adrenaline going. You're a man. You're a man. You're a hot man. You're a hot man.  - Ahh... - You got this. Yeah.  - All right. - All right, ready? Ready, champ? Ready, champ?  - Yeah, all right. - Go get 'em, tiger.  - So what do I do? - You say, "Hey, Em."  - Tell me what-- What do I do?  What do I do? - All right, you're like...  - Are you coming with me? - No. I've never seen  Ben this way around any girl. - Hello, Emily, how are you? - Hello.  I'm good. - Good. I would like to take you for dinner. Would that be okay? - What's she saying? - Where did this come from? - I--I don't know, I just thought of it, and, like. - That'd be lovely.  - Really? - I'd love to.  - That's very good. - Is it a giggle?  - He's a bit flustered. - He does. - See you in the morning and then probably in the afternoon and then... And then probably at dinner. I mean, definitely at dinner. That--that's the definite time I'll see you. - Yes.  - Okay, well, perfect. - Okay, cool.  - Thank you. - Oh, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming. - What happened?  - Oh--what--you did well. - Are you trying to  make her jealous now? - No, I'm not. That's why I want you over here. - Why, why, why? - Because you forced me to do that one. - Oh, so she said yes?  - She wants to go, yeah. - Aw! Yee!  - She does, yeah, she does. - I could tell. Normally, Ben would be like so proud of himself. But actually he seems  more nervous than proud. And it's really cute. You are so cute. - Next on "Below Deck"... - Miss Emily, she has got  the cabin love fever. - I'm going to dinner  with, um, Ben. - Yeah, girl,  you little cheeky sod. Kelley is gonna flip. - You have to give Kyle a chance. He is real-life, British Ryan Gosling. - I felt like  I'm on a date with a girl and she's giving interest  back home while I am with her. And it f---ing hurt me. - Ben?  - He's right here. - Your lady is waiting  in the main salon. - Oh.  - Your lady? What lady? - Emily. They're going on a date. - Oh. - Cheers, Emily.  - Cheers. - To Kelley-- not being here. - Are you upset at me?  - No. I just don't want  you playing with Kyle. You did not tell him the truth. - You shouldn't be judging me. Kelley, I'm not done  talking to you. - And the hits keep coming.
