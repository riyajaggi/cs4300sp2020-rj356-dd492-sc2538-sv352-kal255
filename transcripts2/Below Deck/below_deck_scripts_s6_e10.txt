I'm looking at myself, I'm like, what am I doing wrong to Rhylee? Is it an issue with me? Am I teaching her something wrong? - Me personally, I would be exhausted... - I am, I'm... - Having to explain myself every time why I'm asking you to do something. - You know, I'm happy Ross is putting his foot down, because, you know, I'm having to eat the sh--.

I never learned how to swim. - Someone has to go down. - I know. - Maybe I can rally some people. - Ah. - That's a good idea. - I feel slightly bad because I just told Shannon that I don't know how to swim, and I think she believed me, because she's like, "Kate, "nobody will go down the slide with me. Will you go down?" And I'm not going. I got too much work to do. So, um, does anybody want to go down? - You wanna do it with me? - Yeah, bro. - Are you serious? Yes! - Hey, Ashton, Ashton.

[glasses clink] - So [mumbles] tell me, your last relationship... - [inhales sharply] Great guy, but I kind of lost myself in it. And I believe strongly that the right relationship that you will become the best version of yourself. - I--I come from a broken home with my mom and dad going at each other. So love, for me, is balance. I would get involved with somebody that adds value to my life. But I need to also add value to that person's life. - Entirely. - My parents got divorced when I was quite young, I was five years old. Divorce is not a nice thing to go through. And it's why I haven't had many relationships in the past, because I don't believe in getting so involved in somebody else's life if I don't potentially see that person as somebody that I can marry.

It's just drunken making out. Are we leaving these? - Uh, yeah, we can do that. both: Yeah. - So what's the game plan? - Why don't you start in the master? You know, get the cabin ready. - Yeah. both: Okay. - Why didn't you bring a whole roll out? - Only needed this much. - Oh. - What, alcohol first? - Yep. Alcohol. - Hey, want to know what last night? - What? - Um, Ross... - [soft laugh] I'm shocked. Whoo! But hate is the first sign of love.

Last but not least, Janet and her boyfriend, Jimmy, round out the group. Brandy, Kari, and Janet are taking a trip to celebrate their birthdays and have requested tequila in their hands at all times. We got gluten-free, but other than that, pretty basic. Uh, water toys, Jet Skis, paddleboards, workout and yoga on the yacht. - Laura's a yogi master. - Works for me. How's your new girl doing? She gets it? - She gets it, I think, as much as I need her to get it. I'm happy to have a third stew who has some experience. However, Laura's been here a day. And she's just really annoying. - That about wraps it up. - Whoo, I'm so excited! Charter six! [upbeat music] Should we go down to laundry and fold? - Yeah. - Thank you.

Tyler. - My pleasure. Have a seat. We've got four charters left. Ross will give you all the information that you need. We've got charter guests getting on board, so gonna have to be a quick study. - Okay. - I get a good vibe from Tyler. You're not successful on sailboats without a good work ethic. There's a lot more work, a lot more moving parts on a sailboat than there is on a motor yacht. So all of that is gonna serve Tyler really well, I think. Thanks. - Thank you.
