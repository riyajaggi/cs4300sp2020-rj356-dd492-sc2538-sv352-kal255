 - Previously on "Below Deck"... - Shut the f--- up, dude. - Hey. - Dude, get the f--- out of the car! - This isn't the right place for you. Pack your stuff and leave the boat. - Thank you, God. - You're so adorable. Emily, if something should happen to my wife... - Jesus. This feels like D-list Quentin Tarantino characters. - Is this our anniversary today?

 - Yeah, made it through our first week. - Nico, girlfriend back home? - We just recently started talking. - Oh, so it's just fresh. - What about you there, Lauren? - Single as a Pringle, let's put it that way. This is, like, awkwardly romantic. - Good night, Emily. - Night, night. - Battle is on. No matter who wins, friendship doesn't change. - Oh, no, no. - That tuna's f---ed. Can you just take that away? - Cannot deal with this. I just want to f---ing go home. - Good morning. - Morning.

 - Oh, last day. Back to reality. - What's cracking, yo? - We're working hard out here. For real, though, um, maybe have a chat with Sierra today. She, like, broke down last night. She was cleaning up and she was just like, "I don't know if this is for me." So she's thinking about leaving. - That would be f---ed. Talk about two crew members down. - F---. - She's just got to realize Ben in the kitchen is brutal. - Coming. - Hey, baby. - How'd you sleep? All right? - I didn't go to bed until, like, 2:00, but pretty good, though. - Sierra freaked out last night. - 12 courses is really demanding. I was intense. It probably rubbed off on Sierra. Hopefully we're in better frames of mind today 'cause there's a miraculous thing called sleep. - I don't want her to become discouraged. Maybe if you took her aside and said, "You know, "last night, there was a lot going on. You did a great job." - Absolutely. - Hi. - Hey, baby. - I miss you. - I miss you too. What's going on? - It's been really crazy, Mom. Like, the chef is a really intense person. I really flipped out because I just was so overwhelmed. - I'm pretty thick-skinned, but at the same time, like, I need to have positivity around me. - Yes, Mom. - I love you. - Love you too. - Mostly bacon. - I have a mascarpone and smoked salmon omelet. Would you like some? - A little bit. - All right, we're gonna have-- - That's fantastic wrapping paper. - I'm gonna give you two sheets of uncut $2 bills. - It's amazing. - Hey, it's Sierra. Where would you like me? - Please turn over laundry. - Copy. - ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ - Hey. - Hey, baby. - How are you? - Good. - I think I should be more bashful when delegating a part of my job. - All good. - You good? - Yeah. I'm just trying to chill and stick to myself. - We've all been there, and I promise you, I can't even f---ing explain to you how many times I've been there. We don't have to chat about it. - Yeah. Thanks. - Yeah? Okay, cool. Cool. - ♪ Are you eatin' my fruit? Are you eatin' my fruit? ♪ - Mmm. - Quit eating my fruit, Emily. That papaya is so good. - Is it? - Mm-hmm. - I already know that tomorrow is gonna be f---ing epic. - Ooh, Trevor's not here. This is the first night out we've had without him. I'm not kidding myself. Like, I have a crush on Nico. Like, I feel like he has a crush on me. It's definitely mutual. So I'm excited to see where things go. - So just to let you know, there's a great bar near us called Foxy's. It's, like, a local favorite. Does that sound fun? - Let's go to Foxy's. - Let's go to Foxy's. - Perfect. - Hi, how are you doing? - I'm fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. - So breakfast is wrapping up. The guests are going off the boat. You guys can both go for a dip. - Oh, yay. - Nice, awesome. Thank you. - Okay? It always drove me crazy when anybody ever thought I was, like, too harsh of a leader. I'm actually really lenient. Let me take my break now so that while you guys are swimming, I'll be working. - Okay. - Finally, I have two stewardesses who are enthusiastic and willing to learn, and for that kind of stewardess, I will have all the time in the world and be so patient. I'll be back. - Thank you. - All right, Lauren. - Attention, all crew, all guests are off the boat. - Emily and Sierra, if you want to go for a swim, now is the time. - Captain, is it cool if we join the girls for a dip in the water? - Roger that. - Emily reminds me of my ex, kind of. Just, like, little, fun, outgoing. She's hot. And if Kelley's not here and if it's a competition that he wants, then it's a competition that he gets. - The battle is on. Work first, friendship second, women third. - I mean, he knows. He knows that, you know, I'm gonna win. - Yeah. Come on. - All right, kids. Guests want to come back, so everybody out of the pool. - Hello, welcome back. Can I get you anything to drink? - Can I get a vodka and something? - Ken, you've got some big arms. You're like one of those keg-throwing European guys. - I can do push-ups. - I can do, like, two. - I think we should make a bet. You two guys for a push-up contest. - Okay, it's on. Who loses gets a bikini wax. We could do it in a V for valor. - Valor. - I think I got you. - No. - Oh, that's cool. - Seriously, it's not gonna be pretty. - Smell like lavender. - It's, like, an old wives' tale that people respond to you better if you put lavender oil on your hair. I'm an emotional person, but I'm not gonna let one temper tantrum from a chef derail me from what I want to do. - Well, I hope-- let's hope that works tonight. - Kate, we were asking about getting some bikini wax. We're gonna have a push-up competition, and whoever wins loses... - Okay. - One of the ladies that's with us gets to wax our chest. - It's pretty cool. It's not strange for yachts to host spa parties. So clearly, this yacht has hosted one before. And thankfully, they left their wax. - I'll know in, like, the first one if I'm gonna--okay. - Okay. Legs. - Okay. - Okay, go. - Two. - It's like walruses mating. - Seven. I'm f---ed. - Yeah! - Yeah. - All right. - That's gotta be heated up, right? - Yeah. - I'll get a little bit of my back waxed just to be a good sport too. - Yeah, but we do it on your ass then. - No problem. I got hair there too. - Okay, we have vodka. - Say good-bye to Jeremy. - We have the mobile spa coming out. - How can you have so much hair? - It's very hot. You're gonna put it in the direction the hair is growing. and then pull the opposite way. - In the direction-- - Hurry before it melts. - Just watch the nipples. You'll rip a nipple off. Not good. - Aww. - And you have to do it quick. You have to let it rip. - One, two. - Just f---ing do it. - Three! - Ahh! - Ugh, God. - Rip fast. - Ahh! - Did it hurt? - What the hell's wrong with you? - The look of pain on Jeremy's face broke my heart a little bit... - Yeah, look, there is blood coming out. Now he's bleeding. - Oh, my God. - When I got done laughing. - You did it. - You deserve that. Well done. - I deserve a kiss on the cheek. - Yeah. - Aww, well done. Yeah! - Now bless my back fat. - Whoa. - We're gonna need more wax. Did you really want to do it? - Look at him. Of course he wants to do it. - Wow. - Oh, my God. - Why is Bigfoot getting waxed right now? - How does it look? - It looks like sh--. - Thank you. - Wow. That's pretty impressive. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. You did not say that. - Wow, that's quite demeaning. I find as a female, in life, we're going to get comments from men, whether it be walking down the street and you get car honks, or whether you're on a yacht and you get a drunk man asking to see your V. It's always going-- you're going to get something. Can I get anyone else anything to drink? - I'll just get some water. - Water? - Thank you. - Okay. - Ooh! - Ah. - Hi. - Hello, love. - Thank you very much for inviting me. God bless America. Let's have f---ing fun. - Truffle mash, rib eye with lobster. Okay, that's Dover sole for Carolina. - Oh, surf and turf. - And for you, we've got Dover sole. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - This is the Chianti, but if you want to start a new wine after that, we've got other options. - What? He just tried to kiss me. He just tried... Are you f---ing kidding me? - Come in. - This is the Chianti, but if you want to start a new wine after that, we've got other options. - Creepy is creepy, and I can't wait for these guests to leave. He's like, "I'll try that wine." I was like, "Certainly." And he goes, "And I'll try you too." - No. Okay, Nico, so tonight if I call you on the radio and tell you that zucchinis are burning, that means you come ASAP to my rescue. - Please keep your zucchini away from my oven. - Deal. That was so amazing. - Mr. Chow liked it, right? - They loved it, the guys. - This is a very easy evening. - Let's go to sleep. - Yep. - I'm so tired. - No 12-course dinner. And no tears in the galley. Good night. - Okay. - You can start pulling whenever you're ready. - I love bacon. God bless America. - God bless America. - For bacon. - The anchor's home and secure. - Pull the snubber off and let's get out of here. - You guys don't even know what's under this. It's so gross. Come here. - Kate-- - Oh, God. - Oh, my God. - I love laminating things. I think it's the perfect gift. - Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. - Oh, God. Oh, no. Okay. - This channel keeps getting smaller and smaller. - Cap, you got 60 feet in opening on your starboard aft. - I tell you what, if stupid could fly, these guys would be 7-4s. - Phew. - Does it smell like burned hair? - It's disgusting. - We're gonna present it to our guest. - Do it after the tip. - Hey, we'll put the stern line on first, and the rest, you'll hand to me. No, no, no, no, no. We're gonna hand it to you. We'll worry about that later. Can you hand me that line? Jesus Christ. This dude on the dock is moving like a frickin' turtle. Yeah, yeah, put the eyelet. - Pull in that bowline. - Way up there. - Hey, Nico, Nico. Can you come to the bow? - Yeah, Kelley. Hold on one second. We need a spring here. - Lauren? - Yeah? - Kelley, pull that forward spring in a little bit, can you? - Everything factors in, whether it's the lines, the fenders. To be down a man now, it's-- you know, it could potentially lead to damaging the boat or having an accident. - Hey, Captain, I can't get that one. It's underneath the spring. I need someone up-- oh, f---. Nico, can you come to the bow? - On my way, one second. Take that off. - Yep. - I'm gonna jump back on right now. - Dude, don't jump off the boat in the middle of docking. Can't get the, uh... - No worries, man. - Abreast line. Tighten that one up. - Pull up on that. - We can shut 'em down. Attention all crew, I need everybody on the aft deck in ten. - Deck crew acknowledges. - Just got to... I mean, they're f---ing crinkled, whatever. Really? - Yeah. - Okay, let's line 'em up. - Hello. It was great to meet you. I hope you all enjoyed your trip, okay. - Thank you. - Have safe travels home, okay. - This is for the guys. - Okay. Jeremy, it was so lovely having you on board. - You--oh, my goodness. Unbelievable. - We made you a little something. - Thank you. Thank you for this. I'll remember this. - I bet you will. - Unbelievable. I think I speak for everyone. Amazing life experience. - Fantastic job. I was really looking forward to tasting your cooking. You did not disappoint. - Thank you. - You guys did an amazing job. We have something for you, Captain. - Oh. - Thank you very much. - Well, thank you. - Well deserved. - Thanks, Jeremy. - Thank you very much. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - "Do you have anything to declare?" "Yes, uh, chest hair." - Chest hair. That's awesome. - Let's get to work. Flip the boat. - Thanks. - We gotta have a little talk. - All right. - Today when we were coming in docking... - Yeah. - Just don't hop off the boat again. - Okay. - Just in case he gets blown off the dock or something like that. - Yeah. Sorry about that. - Nico jumping off the boat is a bad reflection on me. The captain's watching me like a hawk, and after the sh-- show that was Trevor, I need the Captain to know that I can run my deck team. - 100% agree. - Cool. - And it won't happen again. - Awesome. - Attention all crew, I need everybody in the crew mess in two minutes. - Hello people. - Hi. - So I know we touched on communication in the last charter. How'd that work out in the interior? Is it working better? - Yep. - Oh, yeah. - I know you had a bit of a, uh, wrench thrown into things with the one guest who didn't like anything in the world. But it must have gone fairly well because... Strip club? - Yeah. - Oh, there we go. - That looks pretty good. - 20. - Ho, ho, ho, ho. - Split ten ways, thank you, Trevor. $2,000 apiece. - Wow. - From Jeremy having his waxing done to inappropriate attention, we've definitely earned this tip. - You can go out this evening. And on that note, you can all count 'em out and give me a hand. - One, two, three, four, five. Can we get leftover ones that I can marry with my leftover ones? - Yes, I have six. - What have you got? What do you need? - I have two ones left over. Anybody? - Here, I've got leftover ones. - You've got 76? - Here's 24. That makes 100. - This is not gonna be as easy as I anticipated at all. - Yeah, we killed it. You killed it. We all killed it. - I'm so happy right now. Can't even mess with this right here. See this vibe going? You could try to mess with it. Try. I dare you. - I don't want to try. - No, no energy. - I will lose against your vibage. - You can't, you can't. - I will lose. - You're gonna lose. - I will lose. - I really enjoy working with Lauren. She's just good vibes. It's become like a brother/sister bond. - I always sat next to a guy in class who used to pick his scabs and eat it. And he would take it all off so it's like one big corn flake and just, like... - She's super open with me, and I'm super open with her, and it's just a friendship that's forming into something really nice. This is a zone. - Yeah. - It's a bubble. - Yeah, and it cannot be popped. - I don't know what's going on between Nico and Lauren. I think for Nico, Lauren's been friend-zoned. I'm not sure Lauren's aware of that. - Kate, Ben, and Kelley, I need all three of you in the crew mess in two. - Kelley and Ben rogers. - Copy. - Hi. - Hi. Charter four. We have Marc Empey and Heidi Homme on a family retreat. They each have two daughters from previous marriages. Kinda like "The Brady Bunch." - "Brady Bunch." - Yeah. - They look so sweet. - She's limited on most seafood. - That's about as wild as it's gonna get. We've got no weirdos. They want to take advantage of all the water toys that are on the yacht. - Roger that. - And they would like an all-white dinner party. - Love. - And we have a new deckhand coming. - Oh, really? - Be here in the morning. Kyle Adam Dixon. - That's a very artistic profile pic. - Oh, wow. - Staring off into a horizon. - And what is that in his right hand? - It's an apple. - A happy napple. It's an apple. - He is a little green. - I can work with green. - He does have some white boat experience. Not a lot, but the labor pool when you don't have a lot of time to waste gets smaller and smaller. - Either he's got the best sense of humor ever, or he's weird. - Let's go to work. - Nico, Lauren, you wanna come down to my cabin for just a sec? - Copy. - Uh, so yeah, we will be getting our new deckhand. He's former British Army. He's pretty green. - Is he? - Yeah. - If he accepts that he's green, then it'll be fine, but if he's green with attitude, then we're gonna have a problem. - Well, he's either gonna be a nob or he's not. - Yeah. - We'll see. - What's going on? - I know something's wrong. I know her so well. - What's she doing? - She just sent me a voice mail, freaked out. - What? - 'Cause she, like, was like, "Oh, okay, bye. Love ya." And she was like, "F---. Like, I said love." There's a difference between "love ya" and "I love you." - Yeah, yeah. - Huge. - I'm thrilled to bits that Kate's happy with Ro. I think being in love takes a certain maturity. And I'm not sure that I've ever really been there. It's when they look into your eyes and say, "I love you." That's when you know you're truly buggered. - That's when you know it's about to go downhill real fast. - Real quick. - Like that. We'd like four 50/50 each cup, okay? - But we don't want to put anyone with 49 and, you know, "Oh, f---." The number one rule of yachting is just don't screw the crew. When you start getting feelings for someone, it's like, "Ugh, sh--." It's confusing. - That PK's gone right to the dome, isn't it? Yeah. - I'd wear something long-sleeve 'cause it's gonna be cold on the way back. - Wow, look at you all dolled up. - Look at you. - Huh, you look nice. - You look very nice. - We're gonna have such a good night tonight. - About to go and get... - The girls are all in black tonight. - Ciao. - Oh, we're going to sit here. Yeah. - Where are you going? And it looks like-- Yeah. - Currently my relationship status is, uh, undefined. Before I left, I was talking to someone back home, but they don't call me Freako for nothing. There's a reason. - I honestly can't figure out what's going on with Nico and Lauren. Like, are they friends? Are they more than friends? Should they be more than friends? I think it's kind of hard for them to even decide. - We're here. - Ooh. - Off the boat. - Thank you. - Off the boat. - Thank you. - Go for it. - Lauren. - I'm gonna help you anyways. - Oh, f---. - Good evening, welcome to The Rock Cafe. - Ooh, lobster tank. - Just look at those spines. - So pretty. - Ooh, it is nice here, isn't it? - I'll take a gin and tonic. - That sounds really good, actually. - Can I have a vodka, fresh lime, and soda water? - What kind of apps are we into, guys? Anything? - Bruschetta. - Okay. - Easy to share. - Em, you want to split one? - Yeah. - Let's get it on. - I'm actually good for drink, thank you. - You're not getting a drink? - What? - I'm putting you in charge. If she comes, that with fettuccine. - Sure. - Well... Sit down here. Have a laugh. It's actually really nice in here. - Nico's coming in hot, and I respect that. But this is like the tortoise and the hare. I'm the tortoise. I'm gonna play the long game. - Hey, baby. Oh, cheeky. - That looks beautiful. - I'll share, guys. - Thank you. Amazing. - Yeah. Amazing. - How's your food? - Really impressive. - What'd you get? - You got the calamari again. Clever. - Yeah. - What the f---? I don't know what's going on with Lauren. - Yeah. - I'll lead the way, boys. Let's make bad decisions. - No, come with me. - No, really. - Don't sulk. - What do you think? I say something, and she just ignores me. - I know something's wrong. I know her energy. I know her so well. - Well, she likes you, man. So just--just trust me on this, um... - Ugh, Lauren, Lauren, Lauren. I feel so bad for her that I don't have those feelings, and the last thing I want to do is hurt her. - This type of emotion will just blow over, and she'll get it. - I would never want to hurt her. - All right, big guy. - Come on, let's go. - We're gonna make sure you have fun. Let's just get in a better place-- - I'm not gonna have fun tonight. - Yeah, you are. Look at me. - What do you mean if they're having fun? - You know what I'm talking about. - Who? Him and Emily? - Lis--I don't want to talk about it. - No, no, no, no. - CocoMaya, Asian Latino fusion. - Nico and I are still getting to know each other, but he's a very interesting character, and he's quite attractive. - Nico! Nico! - I feel, like, embarrassed within myself that I thought we were on the same page, and then now he's flirting with Emily, and I just had no idea that was even anything on his mind. It just-- it's painful to watch, really. Like... Okay. - Dude. - F---. - Oops. I disapprove of anyone making moves on people when they have other connections. I love you all. - Good evening. - Yeah. - All right, off. - Okay, sounds good. - We need to get off. - Lauren, you good? - Good night, guys. - Good night, hon. What? What? No, Nico, no. I go in my room, Nico knocks on my door. And he's like, "Come here." And I'm like, "Oh, what? What?" Like, "What do you have to tell me?" He just tried to kiss me. He just tried... Are you f---ing kidding me? - I think he's just confused. - Come in. Hello. - This is your other deckhand. - I was on motor yacht "Milo." I spent a bit of time in Monaco and the south of France. I've been doing offshore suppling, working on fishing trawlers since then. - What? - We're not in Kansas anymore. - No. - He just tried to kiss me. He just tried to... Are you f---ing kidding me? - I don't--I'm not that kind of girl, and you got a girlfriend. - Oh, really? - What? - Kelley told me you had a girlfriend. - I'm going to bed. Good night. - I think he's just confused. - All crew, all crew, anybody in the crew mess who can help me with provisions? - I hate provisions so much. - I don't want to see Nico this morning. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want him to give me that look that's like, "Hey, you okay?" It's like I do-- I just want--let's just get up and just go to work. - I don't know when our new deckhand is showing up. I thought he was gonna be here at 8:00. - Hiya. Do you want to do a cover? - Sweating out the toxins. - You were pretty sauced up. - Woke up, still had my clothes on. Didn't have anyone else in my bed. - You almost did. - Yeah, I tried making out with everyone. - There was only Nico up there, but he was so drunk. And then we came down to the crew area, and he tried to kiss me. - What? - He tried to kiss me. - No. - Yes, as soon as we got back. - As soon as you got back? - Yes. His name's Freako. But I know that's not who he is. He doesn't--he's not, like, a bad guy. He's not trying to, like, play us all. He just wanted to get a little kiss. - I thought he was getting on really well with Lauren on the exterior as well. - I don't know what the deal is there. - I just want to kinda clarify where we stand, and I don't want to hurt her feelings ever, you know. I care about her a lot. - Yeah. - Just not in a sexual way, you know. - You gotta be real careful with that. When Lauren and Nico work together, they're like best friends. And for a girl to act that way around a guy, no matter how cool she says she is and how she's a bro, she's not. Like, girls catch feelings. As long as it doesn't affect work, I'm gonna let y'all handle it. - Yeah, yeah, no. I mean, there's no need for it to affect our work, and it's not going to. - Like, what was he thinking? - Freako Nico. - How's it going? - Great. - Isn't it great? - I know. - I couldn't wait to get out of bed today, it's so great. - I jumped out like this, "Hello, good morning." Sarcastic. - Hi, pal, how you doing? - Good, how are you? - Kyle. - Kelley. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Is the Captain about? - Yeah, you're the new deckhand, I'm guessing. - Yeah, I believe so, yeah. - All right. Come on, follow me. - Captain. - How are you? - I'm all right, how are you? - I'm good. Welcome aboard. My view on beards, obviously I have one. I like 'em short and trimmed and well-groomed. - Yeah. - So you haven't done much white boat work, huh? For a while. - Mm-hmm. - I spent a bit of time in Monaco and the south of France. - What? That's a crazy British accent, ya wanker. - We're starting out right away with a charter on board in about three hours. So if you want to take him down, get him settled in, and then put him to work. - All right, will do, Captain. - Cheers. We're not in Kansas anymore. - No. So working on a trawler, it's a very dangerous job. So for me, getting into yachting is better because, number one, there's women on the boat. And, number two, it's not deadly. So it kinda sums it up for me that it's a better option. - This will be your cabin. Nico's your roommate. He'll be on top. - Yeah. - We'll change over and then put you to work. - I'm happy with that. Awesome. - All right, cool. Sierra, can I get his uniforms? - You want the whole bag? - Yep. Thank you. - Yeah? - Ah, it's Kelley. Here you go, bud. - Awesome. Cheers, pal. - Did you meet the new deckhand, Captain? - Mm-hmm. - And? - Way too early. - Here's your radio. - Sweet. - Hi, you guys all right? - Hi. - Kyle, nice to meet you. - Apple? I got it for you. - I'll take it. - What's the deal with the CV photo? I want to know now. - I'll explain it, so... I had a photo of me just posing on a yacht with an apple, and I--I liked that one. I'll give it a go. And here I am, so maybe the apple worked. - Hey, yeah. - I love it. - I can barely understand one word he says, and I'm from England. - I'm gonna crack on. - All right, man. Yeah. - Awesome. Cheers, pal. - Stop by anytime, bro. - So this is your other deckhand. - Hi. - Hi, you all right? - Lauren. - Yeah, Lauren. Nice to meet you. Hi, Kyle. - Kyle. Absolute pleasure. - Where's Nico? - I have no idea. - Hey, Em. - Hello. - Um...I wanted to apologize for my actions last night. I was--I think I drank a little bit too much. It was a little bit inappropriate. - I don't think it's very fair that you try and make out with Sierra and myself. - Yeah. - None of us should be made to feel like you were just trying to get with the easiest girl. - Yeah. I'm really sorry about that. I kind of got caught up in the fun, and Freako gets me in trouble sometimes. - How's your head feeling this morning? Yeah. It's getting a beating. - Has the boat lost a bit of respect for Nico, out of interest? - Yeah, kind of. - Really? - Yeah, 'cause he tried making out with every stewardess. But you'll give him extra respect for that, so I understand why you're confused. - Yeah, I know. - Hey, man, how's it going? - How you doing? You all right? - Yeah, Nico. - Kyle. Absolute pleasure. - Kyle. Nice to meet you as well. - Well, go ahead and get with Nico. It's just a little tidy-up right now before the guests get here. - All right. Okay. - So where are you from? - Manchester. - Oh, nice. - I live in London. - Oh, my daughter lives in London. - Your? - Daughter. I met ex missus quite rapidly on a pub crawl, and we had a child unexpectedly. - Are you jet-lagged at all? - I'm all right. I FaceTimed my daughter when I landed. I got to watch her eat raisins for ten minutes today. That was--that was nice. So what do you want me to do right now? - Maybe just, like, go over the stainless just with a chamois, make sure there's no, like, water spots. - Okay, and the chamois are in that locker? - Um, yeah. Check it out. Go through it. Check out the materials that we got, and if you have any questions-- - Port side or starboard? - Starboard side, aft. - Right. - It's just kind of weird right now with Lauren. Just--we just need to fix this. - These guys are not gluten free or lactose intolerant. - No matter what, they're gonna be better than the last group. - You gonna be ready five, ten minutes? - Yeah. - I just want you to go in the laz with Nico to open up all the hatches, find every tool we've got, and make me a list. - Yep. Nico, what a f---ing idiot. - She told him off for trying to kiss her after he tried to kiss me. - What the f---? Not cool. Not cool. - I just hope everything's all right with us. - I guess I want to know what the f--- you were thinking. - She told him off for trying to kiss her after he tried to kiss me. - What the f---? Boy, you did not make any smart moves. I know Nico was wasted last night, but I can't believe he tried to kiss Emily and Sierra. He's just not the guy that I thought he was. - Lauren. - Yeah. - Game time. - All right. - So what's up, chica? - Hey. - How you feeling today? - Fine. You know. - Yeah, you know, I just hope everything's all right with us. You seemed really stressed out, like, you know, I-- - Yeah, I guess I wanna know what the f--- you were thinking? - Just, you know, f---ing alcohol, man. You know, I got super drunk. - Yeah. - Yeah, we all were pretty drunk, but when we sat at the table, you weren't really, like, talking to me at all, so I just felt like maybe I did something to upset you. You know, I don't want anything to change. We work really well. You know what I'm trying to say? - I know, yeah. - You know? - It's a bit of a smack in the face to know that you've just been "friend zoned," but I'm good at just putting it aside and just hoping that the feelings will just trickle away with time. We know where we stand. We know how f---ing good we are together. - I'm glad that we're okay. - We're good. You can't get through us. We're good and we're sweet. - We're cool. - I'm sorry. What was your name again? - Kyle. - Kyle? What you doing? - Ironing. - I don't mind. It's just 'cause, uh, I thought you guys were a bit busy, so I just thought I'd do it 'cause I've got some time to burn. - Okay, well-- - Unless you-- do you wanna do it or-- - No, I'd love to see your skills, though, so I'll let you do these one pants and maybe the captain's. - Oh, I can see this now. Delegation. - Maybe. - To delegate is to inspire. - That's a high honor to iron the captain's pants. - Attention all crew, we have 30 minutes until guest arrival. - I don't think your feet have seen sunlight in, like, four years. That's a good-size boat. - All right, they're coming on. - Welcome aboard. - Thank you. Got a perfect day. - Captain Lee. - Hello. - Hi there. Welcome. - Hi. How are you? Captain Lee. - I'm good. I'm Claire. - Megan. - Hi. - Kelley. - Nice to meet you, Kelley. - Marc, Heidi, welcome aboard "Valor." We've got a lot of fun in store for you. Kate will show you to your rooms, and we'll get out of here and get this party going. - All right, whoo! Ready. - Right this way. - Thank you. - My pleasure. So this is the main salon. - Ooh. - This boat was recently refit, so all of this is brand-new. This is our master, and the bathroom is quite large. - I'll just load 'em up here with you? - Yeah. - There's a bathtub, a huge shower. - You don't get that everywhere. - And then we're gonna go to sun deck. - Oh, wow. - So we've got a Jacuzzi. And then we call this the bunny pad. It's great for laying out while we're under way. - Gorgeous. - Okay, let's go. Bow to stern starting now. Let's go ahead and get the bowlines off. - The spring line, you're gonna drop. The breast line, you're gonna bring up. - That goes to the mom. This goes to the dad. - So it's like drop spring first and just pull that one in, yeah? - Go ahead and uncoil it off. - I got one line standing here. Let's get it off. - Okay, Cap. All lines clear astern. - All right, we're coming out of here. - This is awesome. - Yeah, it's ridiculous. - Kyle was sent from heaven. - We're all meshing very well; we're doing our job well. It's awesome. - Can I get anybody a refill or something to drink besides champagne? - A Captain and Sprite for me, please. - How hungry are y'all? You want to do lunch around 2:00? - Can I get another mojito, please? - Mojito, yeah, of course. - Thank you. - As long as they have cocktails, they can do-- They don't care. - My kind of people. - I think this primary has accepted his fate that he's gonna be surrounded by drunk women all the time, and he handles it with grace. Ben. - Yes. - I asked them if they would like lunch around 2:00. Is that good for you? - Okay. So they're not like, "Oh, we're really hungry" or-- - No, they're like, "Hey, who needs food when you've got drinks?" - She wants to try mojitos, but she hates mojitos. - It tastes like salad in your drink, bro. - No, it doesn't. - Why do I want to eat my drink? - No, thank you. - Hi, Kyle. I'm Sierra. I know we met earlier. - Been very busy, so I haven't bothered you all day. - Yeah, I felt like I was dying earlier, and then I got really busy. Busy's good, though; I feel like it makes the time go by and, like, the way these charters are set up, like, it just flies. - So where's all, like, the treats? Where's the fat food? - The fat food? Oh, you can, like, face me. Face me and then, like, under that cabinet, like, under-- - We just met, Sierra; you're making me bend over already. - No, no, you can just, like, lean. - Sierra's looking nice. She's just exactly what I need. She's very, like, cold weather, like, Norwegian. And I'm a Viking. So she can come sailing with me anytime. - If you and Claire got in a fight, like a fistfight-- - Like a fistfight? I feel like we're both scrappy as f---. - So, Ben, what are you making for lunch? - Asparagus salad with roast beet, goat cheese, Mediterranean sea bass, and I'm gonna go in strong with a potato salad. - Yeah. - Trufflize the hell out of it. - Oh, boy. - Give me three shots. - Roger, three shots. - Lock it down at three. You're good. - Those tie up at the top there like that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, perfect. - Kyle seems really cool. - So nice. Very nice. - Somebody needs to get lucky on this boat. - There's a lot of sexual tension on the boat. Emily should just take her pick. Someone. Whatever. All of them. I don't care. - Whoo! - You all right, Kyle? - Is he all right? What happened? - You all right? - F---ing hell. - Oh, my God. - Holy sh--. - F---. - Hey, Kyle, go throw on your swim shorts and rash guard. - So just to let you know, Ben's starting to platter up lunch, and I've got the table set downstairs whenever you guys are ready. - Okay, terrific. Downstairs for lunch. - Get started on getting the toys in. - We're already on it, Captain. - Thank you, sir. - No, we gotta go out this way, right? - That's the way. - There it is. - Got you. This is the first time I've ever been to the Caribbean, and I'm so excited to be here. I'm in the BVIs, man. You know? And I'm getting somewhere in my life. It's great. - Would you like some potato salad? - Yes, I would. Great. - Goat cheese, kiwi, roasted beets. - Ooh, beets. I see beets. - Goat cheese. - Ben gets an A on this one. - Kids are messed up. - Who raised us? - Not me. - It's actually kind of surprising to me that these parents are encouraging and allowing their daughters to drink so much. - Kit Kats and Coors Light. Killing it. - I want them to remember their vacation, so maybe it's time we start serving them a little bit lighter drinks. - You like it. You like it. - Look at that. Whoo! - So one of those in each bag and then we'll give you these lighter ones afterwards. - All right. - F---. - You all right, Kyle? - Is he all right? What happened? - You all right? - F---. F---ing hell. - Oh, my God. - Holy sh--. Did he dislocate his shoulder? - Next on "Below Deck"... - Oh, Ro's coming to visit. - Who the f--- is that? What? - Oh, my God, Ben is, like, hating his life right now. - Come on. - I need to cool off. - Whoa! - I like my girls tiny, like, "Oh, I'm gonna protect you." - What are you doing? Kelley. - You do realize, though, that I find you very attractive? You're stunning, absolutely beautiful. Kelley, Kelley, Lee. I've been looking at dirty f---ing windows for three f---ing days. - That's all inside. - Do you really want to go to war on this? I want it done. - They're properly sauced up now, right? - They're drinking at a rate that even impresses and scares me. - Oh! - Whoo! - You guys are over the reef. - For more info, go to:
