 - Previously on "Below Deck"... - Hello, lovely to meet you. - Oh, good to meet you. Kelley. It's been five months of no sex. Trouble. It's just gonna be trouble for me. Oh, sh--. - I think it's wild. - My girlfriend's name is Ro. I was never in the closet. I just kind of went in the closet for a second, picked out a new outfit, and came right back out. - Just make sure when you're done with any hose, drain it. So yeah, these windows, and then flats.

 Just scrub this deck. - All right. - I was, like, 14. - Really? - You weren't being undermined. That was f---ing plain rude, bro. - No, it wasn't. - Good job, senior deckhand. - Hey, hey, hey. I modeled for Paul Mitchell for two years almost. You go into a Paul Mitchell catalogue still to this day you'll see me in the long hair. - Yeah, let's get weird. - I hear that. - Cheers. - Yay. - Did you just chug that? - Trevor did. - Can I get a Bud Light, and two filthy martinis? - Just chill the f--- out. - Oh sh--.

 Whoa. - You're sh--faced. - I'm sh--faced? Because I'm telling you something different? - You're not telling me anything. - Of Ben being a dick and you being a bitch? - You need to chill out. - Sorry, Trevor. - Ah! - Oh, my God, it was such a fun night, why is he being weird now? - Trevor is this belligerent little redneck, you know, I'm just not into it. - Shut the f--- up. - Shut the f--- up, dude. - Hey, bro, stop. - Just sit the f--- down, man. - Yeah, f---ing do it, dude. - Everyone! - We're all intoxicated. They're talking sh--. - That's crossing the line. - Guys! Stop! - We need to stop, we're walking, I'm serious. - Nico, Nico. - Mother----er. - You're a joke. - It's nothing. - You're a joke. - You're a dick. - You don't insult people that have fought for you, especially my brothers. Guess what. You're not coming back on the boat tonight. - Thank you. - You can go stay in a f---ing hotel room. - I don't give a f---, dude. You shouldn't have gone in the military. - Yeah, you're right, dude. You-- You're a sh-- yachtie. Go f--- yourself. - Right, right! You're a joke. - Dude's running his mouth about my marines. They're my brothers, man. - He's an asshole. He's got nothing to do with you or your boys. F--- him. - Yeah. - F---ing wanker. - You haven't seen my radio, have you? - No, I'm sorry I haven't. - Okay. - I haven't woken up yet. Oh, f---. I'm still drunk. - Did you talk to the captain? - Nope, not yet. - Yeah? - Soon I get to have that fun conversation. - Good morning. How are you? - Good, has anyone seen my radio? I seem to have misplaced it. - Well, you can use Trevor's radio 'cause he's not on the boat. - Huh? - Let me grab your cereal and then we can chat. - Trevor was a lot more drunk than everyone realized. It reminds me, 'cause I've got, like, an alcoholic in my family, and it's exactly the same sh--, like, they just keep doing it. - Nice jammies, Kate. - Thank you. - How are you after last night? - I was pretty pissed off, but I appreciate you having my back, you know? - Hey, always. - So we have no Trevor on board, huh? Where did we lose him at? - The ride home. - Wow. - But I think it's best if Kelley tells you how it ended. - Mm-kay, and we'll handle it. Kelley, Kelley, Lee. - Go for Kelley. - Can I see you in the wheelhouse, please? - Yes sir, en route. Morning, Captain. - Good morning. - Another fun night off. - Want to give me a synopsis? - He got wasted again. He was being rude to Ben. Ben goes "quit annoying me," and that just set off a trigger. He got in my face, and on the bus ride back he was wanting to fight people. Yeah, and then he started talking sh-- about marines that passed away, and he hit a real bad nerve on me, and so I told him he wasn't coming back on the boat last night. - Okay. Sometimes in the heat of the moment people say one thing and somebody interprets it totally different. - Yeah. - So, I'd like to hear what everybody else has to say. - What's in there? - Blueberries, bananas, green powder, macka, which, like, keeps your sexy juices flowing. - Uh-huh, my sexy juices flow just fine. - It's like an herb. Oh, no. I know it, God. - Hey, Lauren? - Yeah. - Go see the Captain. - Oh, f---, really? - Yeah. - Hola, had an eventful evening last night, huh? - Yeah. - Want to just give me a synopsis of what transpired? - Trevor had a few more drinks, and all of us were-- - It all started from him basically arguing with Ben, and it was like a ticking time bomb. - He drinks too much, and when he does he just becomes really mouthy. - When coming back on the bus he was just starting to get really, really aggressive. - Yeah, he was just being quite threatening and-- - Really? - He's a f---ing hothead. - It wasn't okay, and the girls were really freaked out. - Okay, well, I appreciate your input. - Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - I will deal with it... - Thank you. - One way or another. - I hope so. - I will. - All right. - You know, the way he was talking... - He was digging himself a hole, like. - It was a grave, man. - Do you think he should be fired? - Yeah, because he doesn't want to learn. - I think he deserves one more chance. - So we should wait till he actually kills someone? - Oh, there we go. - Oh f---. Turn around. - Yeah. - Hey, Trevor. - Morning, Cap. - How you doing this morning? - I'm good. I didn't get much sleep. - No? - No, sir. Look, I know you probably know what happened last night. I mean, it was fine for the entire night until we got back on that bus with just the whole them figuring out I was a hair model. - What? - I want to figure this out, 'cause I mean, I'm a hard worker but I'm still in the learning process and some people don't get it the same way. Like, when I say something, it comes off a bit rash or short, and I don't want that to happen. I think it's a communication issue honestly, but I'm coming to you for guidance. - I think I know how to handle this. Kelley, Kelley, Lee. - Go for Kelley. - Yeah, can I get you to the bridge, please? The reason I asked Kelley up here is because I want him to hear what I have to say. I think that once is an accident, twice is a pattern. Do I believe in my gut there'll be a third time? Without a doubt. We still have a long way to go this season, and I cannot afford to babysit. I think this isn't the right place for you at this point in time. I'm gonna give you an opportunity to pack your stuff and leave the boat on good terms. You can go say good-bye to the crew, make apologies if you like. If you don't, that's fine too. - That's bullsh--, man, I'm gonna let you bow out and apologize to the crew, like, where is the crew apologizing to me? - Sorry it worked out this way, but I have the whole boat and the whole season to think of, okay? - Yes, sir. I owe you an apology though. - Sorry it didn't work out, bud. You should go back to being a f---ing hair model. - Hey man, I apologize. I'm leaving. - Are you? - Yeah, I just got kicked off. - Oh, dude. We've all woken up with really bad feelings, and sometimes we're forgiven, sometimes we're not. But in this profession, it's pretty tough to be forgiven twice. - I just talked to Trevor and the Captain. There's three of us now. He's gone. - I'm staying out of it. I don't want to stir anymore sh--. Thank you God for sending this bad energy out of my life. - I just need y'all to be easy. Just let him go. Let him go on a good note. - It's tough to leave and not know what your next destination's gonna be. I don't know who could come in and replace me. It's gonna be tough. Hey, Kate? - Yes? - Is that all my laundry out of there? - There's some on the counter over there if you want to look through it. We all have to hit rock bottom before we make good life changes. So hopefully this'll be the best thing that ever happened to him. You're welcome, Trevor. - All right, Trev, take care of yourself. Good luck to you. - All right, thanks, Cap. - I kind of feel like I failed a little bit. - Well, yeah, maybe a little, but you're still learning. - I think it'll be smoother without him. - Better be. - That's done and over with. - One guest doesn't eat meat, gluten-free, dairy-free, wheat-free, and then they wanted a formal dinner on the first night with 12-course tasting menu. - Sh--. - I think us three as a team is powerful, so... - Exactly. I'm not worried about us anyway. We'll be great. - I don't need to think about it twice. - We got a strong trio. - Maybe a little more physically tired, but we'll be good. - Yeah. - Did he say anything to y'all? - He didn't say a word. Didn't look at me, didn't... - Nada. - And I don't know if that's him being embarrassed or if that's just him being a dick. - Yeah. - F--- you, Trevor. I'm moving to the top bunk. - Moving back to top bunk, mother----er. - Hi. - Oh, hey, hon. - So Trevor is gone. - Yeah, I didn't get a chance to say bye. - I hate to see him go, but it just wasn't a good fit. Trevor never did anything to me. He was always friendly, like, there was a lot of negative energy on the boat and I could tell that he was having a hard time. - Trevor just got off on the wrong foot, and he carried on that path. - I'm tired today. - Nice night. It was fun though apart from everything else. - The swings were legendary. - How fun are they? No, these are on the swings. - Yeah, you're like, "Have you seen the other swings?" And I was like, "Where is she taking me?" Emily's hot, she's cool. Oh, f---. I'm gonna get in trouble, I know it. I don't care. It was awesome. - Never underestimate. - Kate, Ben, and Kelley, I need you guys in the crew mess immediately. We need a preference sheet meeting. - Yeah. - So this is a group of entrepreneurs that have met and developed a strong friendship through their internet companies. We have John Chow and the co-primary Jeremy Schoemaker. We have John's daughter, Ashley, we have some interesting aspects to this charter. They want to do a lot of exploring, and a beach bar. Do you see any issues with being a man down on this thing? - No, we'll make it. - And I'll get somebody as soon as I can to help us out, all right? So one guest likes absolutely nothing. She doesn't eat meat, chicken, or pork. She doesn't eat seafood, except fish. - So she eats fish. - And she's gluten-free, dairy-free, wheat-free, and water has to be pH above 7.5. - Sh--. - And then they want to do a formal dinner on the first night with 12-course tasting menu. - Whoa. - Wow. - Whoa. - 12 courses is, like, insane. We should be starting at 3:00 p.m. 12 courses is crazy. - So what are your concerns, Benjamin? Besides everything? - Ben is stressed. - F---. F--- it. - Okay. Trevor was a quintessential idiot. The guy wears his baseball cap backwards with sunglasses. - Another charter, man. - Another one. - I'm already looking forward for them to leave. We should just do, like, a pre-thing, like, where they get on and they just hand us the envelope to begin with. It's, like, just give me your money. - Mm-hmm, let's look at these bad boys, huh? - They look intimidating though, don't they? - They want all the water toys, sea bobs, water skiing, inflatable toys. - You guys are going to have a lot on your plate. - Especially 'cause there's three of us now. The inflatable pool, for example, that, like, takes four if not five people. - Yeah. - We're such an effective team. But we'll have him out of our mind. - That's what I'm saying is, I might pick up, like, an extra hobby, maybe play guitar or something. There's gonna be so much extra time we're gonna have. - I will leave that there for other people to read. - I'm going to bed. - All right. - Night-night. - Night, hon. I'll see you in the morning. - Catch you in the morning. - Babe, I can't hear you. Open it. I want to Skype. Open it. F---, I hate you. Open it. I've always just left land life behind, but now that I have someone I want to talk to on a regular basis, this Wi-Fi's really become an issue. I've been trying to get in touch with you for two hours. I mean, getting a wire coat hanger wrapped in foil and standing on the radar might be a better idea... I am so tired. - You look great. - Than trying to connect to "Valor" Wi-Fi. - Oh, baby, what you want to do? I know what I want to do. - Oh, you're funny. - What are you doing? You... - Oh, sh--. Babe, hello? F---. - Hey, Babe, good morning. - 12-course tasting menu tonight. - Ben is gonna lose his mind. One of the guests is gluten-free, some kind of vegan hippy crap. - That's how I prefer to eat. - Yeah? - Yeah, I just always like healthier stuff. Like, I started juicing, and it became a business. - Wow. - But it was really hard, because I was really broke, and I found out about yachting, and I was like, "Okay, this is what I'm gonna do." I want to make a ton of money and return to the industry of juice. Like, it's what I'm really passionate about. It's changed my life, and I want to change others. - Well, you should make juice for the crew. - I would love to. - Yeah. - The trinamic trio. - The trinamic? - The terrific trio. - F---ing effective deck team we are. - Yeah. - I need gluten-free f---ing everything. - If you need any help, like, I used to do catering. For her, we could do fresh rolls and get some avocado, mint, veggies inside. - Great idea. - Like, a roasted beet and goat cheese salad. Or some fruit, maybe a cream, that would be so good. - Sierra and Carolina are a match made in gluten-free heaven, which for most people is actually hell. You should be her personal chef. - Okay. - Stop it. - Attention all crew, we got provisions out on the dock. I need some people up here. - Oh, it is a bit windy today. - He's gonna have a hell of a time getting off the dock. All right, their charter a man down sucks, but it's us three doing the work anyways. Watch schedule, I'm 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Lauren, you're in the kitchen till 11:00. - Okay. - Nico, you're 9:00 to whenever the guests go down. I'm gonna be up on bow for lines. y'all are gonna stay where y'all are. You're gonna be draining the hot tub. So before we pull out of port, you've got to run up there and drain it. - Okay, so are we still doing the pool this charter? - Yeah. - Okay, okay. - All right, you guys, y'all ready? - Yeah, I think it's gonna be a good charter. - Hell, yeah. - Oh, please work. Don't do this. - Sh--. It's not working. - Do you need help? - If you can make this work for me, that would be good. Sorry, Sierra, but you're dumb as a box of rocks. - You got it to work? You're the best. - No problem. Uh-uh, you got to use this. - Thank you. - No problem. - Okay, I need all the crew out here, now. Guests are on their way, and they're walking down the dock. Let's go. - That is a beauty. - I can't wait to get on that puppy. - Of course the wind comes right back up. - So great having the most top-heavy drinks. - F---. - ♪ Time to make that money ♪ Oh, f---. Sh--. - They're here. - Hello. - Hi. - Welcome aboard "Valor." Captain Lee. - John Chow, pleasure to meet you. - My pleasure. - Welcome. - Thank you very much. - Hello. - Hello. - Welcome. - Hello, lovely to meet you. - Cheers, guys. Cheers. - Welcome aboard "Valor," everybody. We've got a great few days planned for you. Kate will give you a tour of the boat and I'd like to get off the dock so we can get your party started. - Awesome, sounds good, thank you. - Right this way, guys. So this is the main salon. - Oh, wow beautiful. - The boat was just refitted, so this is all brand-new. - Wow. - So now we're going onto the master suite. - Yay. - Yeah, you love? - My room. - It's awesome. - Oh, my God. Heavy, huh? - Watch out, watch out, watch out. Jesus. - We've got two mirror-image rooms. that are exactly the same, and then this room with the two twin beds. And then we'll continue down the hallway, and I'll show y'all... - I am getting a strange vibe from these people. Mr. Chow, Gene the Russian, the creepy white-haired guy that wants to kill you with his eyeballs. This feels like D-list Quentin Tarantino characters. - Male bonding right there. - This room's got our name on it. - Okay, let's get all our deckhands in position so we can get out of here, please. - Copy that, standing by. - And we're gonna go up to the sun deck. So we've got a nice, large Jacuzzi. - There's the Jacuzzi. - Let's get naked. - Deckhands are ready when you are. - Copy that. - Get that floating fender on that corner! - That wind's kicking off, man. - I've got two fenders on the stern. - Why don't you run back and single up that stern line as well. - Okay, what flag is that? Is that a country I should know? - You really are geographically challenged, aren't you? - Oh, very, very much so. - Stern line's clear, Captain. - All lines are clear. - Roger that, we're coming off. - F---, they're just, like, bouncing off. - Yeah, I don't think we're gonna be able to get off this. - This boat is a little under-powered with the wind blowing against it, and you're trying to go the other direction and then the tide's trying to take you in a third direction. F---, come on. - We got a break in this gust. - I'm cranking the thrusters. She's coming out. - Yes. - Okay, let's do this. - Whoo, nice job. We killed it. It's nice out once you're moving. - Look at that small boat. - 5 percenters. - How can you live? Do you want to borrow some money? - Okay, give me three shots. - Roger. Okay, here we go. That's three shots. - Lock it in. - What time is it in New York right now? - You have a business call? - Yeah, I do. - We're on vacation. - I'm never on vacation. - Always on vacation. That's the great thing about doing it autopilot. It's just making the money while I'm sitting here. - We're making more money right now than most people make in a year. - And we're on a boat. - How do you guys think 2:00 for lunch sounds? - Good. - Is that good? - Perfect. - Hey, Kelley, I'm just gonna straighten up the bridge deck aft. - Roger that. Thank you, Nico. - Hi, Ben. - Hello. - 2:00 works. - Brilliant, thank you. - What do you want to make? - I'm doing duck breast, some seared tuna. - Okay. - Right now, I just want to give the guests lunch, because I need a good amount of time to prepare for this 12-course dinner. - That looks good, spicy. - We do have one girl. - Yeah, your best friend? - Yeah, my best buddy. - Yeah. - She doesn't like spicy. - It's not that spicy. - So are they in the water? Or what are they doing, baby? Oh. - I hope you were talking to Kate. I--I was. - You guys want to have a seat? We can start bringing out lunch. - Oh, thank you. - You're so adorable. Emily, if something should happen to my wife... - Is that what he said? - And then... - If my wife dies? Jesus, she's probably gonna commit suicide. - ♪ It's charter time ♪ - Nothing. - Would you like some conch salad? - What's in that salad? - Conch. - What's conch? - It's a fish. - I love the beet salad. - ♪ Time to make that money ♪ ♪ Make that money ♪ F---. Sh--. Oh, sh--. F---, f---. - It seems like a very diverse group. Diverse preferences. - I know, we'll have to deal with that. - You want some lemonade? It's so good. - F---ing hell. - What? - It's sweet, very sweet. Sierra's lemonade is awful. I hope her culinary skills are better than her juicing skills. - I like it, whatever. - Yeah, Kelley, whenever you have a moment will you come to the sun deck? - Yeah, coming to the sun deck. - So good. - Would you like some tuna? - I would, and could I get more quinoa? - Of course. - Holy, hey, was it raining again? - No, it's not raining, it over-filled. I thought it stops. - No. - Yeah, man, that's totally my bad. I'm draining it now. - All right. I'm gonna grab a shammy and help. - Yeah, thanks. F---ing hot tub. F---ing Jacuzzi, are you serious? Like, really? F---ing Jacuzzi. - It happened at the best time it could, 'cause they're down there eating, so nobody's gonna be up here for a minute. Everything will be dry. It'll all be good. - Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I should've checked it. - It's no big deal. Don't beat yourself up. - He likes food. - Who? Chow? - Yeah, I'm looking at, like, his Instagram. He loves food. There's so many food photos. - I wish it was just him. - Yeah. - But I can have Sierra from now on, right, baby? - She's gonna come talk to you about meal plan and everything? - Yeah, of course. - You gonna go swimming? I think that we-- - I'm always ready to go swimming. - Where is--can we go to the Jacuzzi? - Kelley, Kelley, Lee, break out every toy we got. I want the pool-- all the sea bobs. If it floats, I want it behind the boat, okay? - Roger that. - Right now. I believe that Kelley has the skill to manage the team being a man down, but only time will tell. - Ready? One, two, three. - It's heavy as f---. - Ready and one, two, three. - All right, hold on, push this way a bit more. - Yeah, ready one, two, three. - Oh, f---. Damn it, man. - You all right? - Let's do this. - Like, augh, there's so much stuff we need to bring out. That needs to come. We need to f---. So with a man down, it's, like.... Oh, sh--. Well done, Lauren. - I've seen horses that have manes that had shorter hair than this guy on his back. - Can I stand on this? - Just carefully. It's a bit slippy, but it's hard, so you'll be okay. - All right. I don't think people actually appreciate how difficult it is to do a 12-course tasting menu in a tiny kitchen on a boat. - So, Ben? - Yes. - I have not done a 12-course service before. What should I expect? - Chaos. - You might cry. - Whoa. - Nico, pick up this bob, please. - We're running around everywhere like chickens with our heads cut off. I am completely exhausted right now. - Yeah! - Right here, conch, scallop, foie gras. She's excluded from all three of them, so why not just give her a really nice salad with every f---ing vegetable I have. - Okay. - All right? That way she'll be tide over. The game plan for Carolina is to give her food that she can eat while the others are eating courses that she won't eat. So I'm hoping Sierra will be able to lift that burden and deal with Carolina tonight. Yeah, I think a nice sautéed bit of tuna or something like that. - Yeah, she likes the fish. - All right, so let's write that down. Sorry, I'm a little freaked out. - Yeah. Part of me is afraid that sending Sierra in to help Ben is like sending a cute little innocent bunny into a rabid lion's den, but the bunny's helping the rabid lion, so I hope the rabid lion can keep it in check. - Just hold on. - So she can have scallop? - She can't have scallop, she doesn't eat shellfish. - Oh, sashimi? - No, 'cause conch's in a shell. - Oh, okay. So is the scallop. Okay, just if I were you, I'd just take--just f---ing get some veggies up here. - Okay. - Cool. - Whatever. - All right, hold on. - Ooh, I'm so sorry. - Yeah, I can see you're a little rattled. - What's going on? - That tuna's f---ed. I don't want to serve it anymore. - Can't deal with this. So f---ed up. - What list are you writing? - What I'm making. We're substituting two of the courses for the woman with a lot of dietary restrictions. Things are just getting, like, lost in translation. It's very important for me to make a good impression on Ben with the guests, so this is kind of a test. - Hello, ladies. So are you both gonna be in the galley then? The dynamic duo? - Have they asked what time's dinner? 8:30, 9:00? - Okay, thank you. - Ow, f---. Dinner is 8:30, 9:00-ish. Closer to 8:30 would be good. - Yeah? Okay. - All right, here we go. Hey, baby. - Yes, under the fridge, you'll find muffin trays please. Spray the hell out of that muffin. A 12-course tasting menu is a ton of work. It's just very overwhelming, and I'm just trying to get my head round it. Can you just pull out some all-purpose flour, please? No, that's gluten-free. - Oh, sorry. So I need someone who actually can distinguish clear thoughts in a very small amount of time. We need to pass this through the strainer, the big spoon--here, these are quite good for that. Augh, okay, so the garlic will go through. It's soft enough. - Sorry. - Right, let's pull out eight shot glasses and just line them up in the freezer nicely so they don't fall. No, no, no, babe, babe, babe, they've all got to be the same. - Sorry. - My stress level's a little high in here tonight, baby. - Okay, I'm trying to give you some Zen. - I like that. That's why you're here, baby. - Okay, let's go. - Hello. - Oh, wow. - Whoo. - Saving the best for last. - Ben, all the guests are seated and ready. Yeah, and I can take the gazpacho right here. - All righty, baby, let's bring it on. - Every meal with Ben should be 12 courses, because then he'd always be on time. - Very smart. - Thank you, yeah. All right, here we go. - What kind of gazpacho? - Beetroot and ginger. - Okay. For our first course, we have beetroot and ginger gazpacho. - Cheers everybody. - Here we go, cheers, cheers. - Oh, yeah. - That was good. - If you had the option of making it the Love Boat, who would you love? - Emily, all day. - Emily huh? - Emily, yeah. What about you? - Yeah, probably Emily. - Similar tastes. Sierra, what do you think? She just seems a little cray-cray. - Yeah, man. - Something's just a little off with her. - She has the eyes of a crazy woman. I mean, she's very pretty. But she smiles kind of crazily. - Seared foie gras. - Seared foie gras. - Strawberry jam. Sierra, how are you, baby? - Good, I just have to put the salad together. - Wait, hold on. I don't--I mean... What have you been doing this whole f---ing time? - I'll be done in five seconds. - Amazing. - Yeah, thank you. - This is incredible. - Seared foie gras with strawberry jam. - Oh, I love that. - Yeah, we have a salad for you coming out next. - Oh. - Mmm, I love foie gras. - Do they like it? - They seem very happy, but they're finished. Ben, do you want to toss and vinaigrette? - What is it, hon? - The salad? - Do I want to what? - Toss it before it goes out? - Your baby, all right? - Sure. I'm pretty thick-skinned, but at the same time, like, I need to have positivity around me. - Maybe we'll have, like, 50 people and 50 girls. We can have 100 girls just taking care of everybody in every way possible. - Yes, of course. - John Chow's daughter's at the table. This is just gross. - I have venues. I'll set it up. - Thank you, girls. - This course is a lemon ginger truffle caviar sashimi of scallops. - Ooh, caviar. - These are very good. Never had them raw. - I don't like caviar. - I'll be done in five seconds. This will take a while. - I'm beginning to wonder what is going on with Sierra. She has two courses to do tonight and all she's doing is making the world's biggest salad. All right, let's get those frosties over here, please. - Sierra, you're plating yours? - Ready to go. - Perfect. So this course, we have sashimi of conch. - Mmm. That's actually good. - Carolina. - Oh, thank you. Here's a special salad for you. - Wow. - But am I gonna skip all the 12 courses then? - Yes. Yes, is that okay? - No, I don't want to stare when they get all the courses and I don't. - Okay. - Everyone stare at her. Everyone stare at Carolina. - No, I'm disappointed. - How are we doing, Ben? - So far so good. - How you doing? - Good. I'm just, like, on standby, kitchen hand. - Yeah, she's amazing. - Ben? - Yes? - She said she would like to participate in the courses, so could you make her a conch salad quickly? - What the actual f---? - Sorry, Ben. - The preference sheet reads in a very specific way-- - She ate conch at lunch, so maybe she's confused. - I just left all of it over there. - She's confused. - This is the conch sashimi if you want to try it. - Thank you. - My pleasure. - Hmm-hmm-hmm. - Ohh. - All right, good. - A raspberry sorbet. - Coconut lobster fritter. - Pumpkin puree, ginger, and lime. - Oh, here we go. - Tuna's next, honey bunny. - How many seconds would you do it for? A minute? - Just sear the hell out of it. In the oil, yeah, yeah, that's it. Now lay it on the oil. - Ooh. - Kate, we need some glasses. - I heard. - Good. - Okay, bring the tuna here. - Tuna's next course? Is that what you're making next, so I know what cutlery to put out next? - Yeah. Wait, hold on. - All right, just it's... the seared ahi tuna, it needs to be as aesthetically pleasing as the raw tuna. That tuna's f---ed. But this is not the case. I don't want to serve it anymore. It's just--it's f---ed. - We'll catch you in the morning. - The battle is on, no matter who wins... - Oh, no, no. - That tuna's f---ed. I don't want to serve it anymore. It's just--it's f---ed. Can you just take that away, please? And then dump the rest. - Can I set it there? - Okay, that has baba ghanoush on it, all right? - I was just doing what I was told. I...I don't know. - Let's keep it going. Ready? - Cheers. Level's, you know... - Making you nervous? Making you nervous? - Kind of ruins the shape of it to be honest. - It's not ruining the shape. Here we have a blockade of tuna over an orange Cointreau vinaigrette. - It looks like watermelon. - Yay, watermelon. - Yeah, I can't. I'm just not big on raw fish. It's too much. - You're not done yet, so... - I understand that, baby. I understand that. Actually, I thought I was done. - Ooh, I'm so sorry. - F---. It's all right. - Sorry. It's fine. It's--it's an honest mistake. Sierra, I can see you're a little rattled; it's all good. - What's going on? - Nothing's going on. Chill, would you? - Well, I just took plates out. - We had a little accident, and that's okay, all right? - Yeah. - All right? Good. - Like, ooh, I'm just gonna let that happen by itself. - Can I take it then? - Yeah, just--please, all right? - Well-- - You're making Sierra very nervous tonight, babe. - Uh-huh. - Ready to go? - Yeah. Grilled calamari steak with a roasted garlic tomato. Okay, I'll try it. I'm not picky. Oh, it's 10:30. - What course are we on? - I have no idea. - Just do the edges on that. That's good. - Thank you. - Thank you, Kate. - This is a mango sorbet to get you ready for the next course. - All right, let's get this lamb dish out the way. - Babe, Emily? - Yes? - Emily, since you're on earlies why don't you go ahead and go down for the night? - Okay, night-night. - Good night. - Thank you. - What time do we need to be up by tomorrow? - I think they're getting kind of tired and-- - How's John? - Mmm. - He's happy. - That's all that matters. - Okay, and I'll only tell you about him. Lamb. - All right, thanks. - Ooh. - Here we have lamb lollipops. - Oh, that's good lamb. - Oh, f---. - I won't, do worry, Kate will kill me. - Nothing, I've just got to fold this machine, and then I'm done. I'm done. - Give me some of that. I'm not sure where Emily stands. I've thrown out some hints to her that I'm interested, but she gives off the weirdest signs though. - You looked so sleepy when you got up this morning. I wish I could read British. - Obviously. - Bang. Gosh, let's do it. - All right, all right, here we go. - Flourless chocolate cake, chocolate sauce, homemade vanilla ice cream, spun sugar. - This is the final grand finale 12th course. - Wow look at that. - I told you. - Cheers to this. - Mmm. - How's it going, Em? How'd tonight go? - Is she? - I want to get the full picture before I decipher anything. I just don't really-- I'll talk to her, kind of figure out what happened. - Are you doing them in quarters? - Well, I just go like that. - Okay. - I've done stew work before. - Oh, really? - My first boat was an all-male crew. - The guys good at? - We were very good. - He's a sneaky one, that Kelley. He's kind of just cock-blocking. He puts his shirt off. How's everything going interior-wise? - I think really good. I like our team. - That's good. That's all that matters, you know. You put out positive things, and you'll get positive things back towards you. You know what I mean? - That's a good thing really to think. Yeah. - What up? - What's up? - It's nice getting male attention. It's needed sometimes, and who doesn't like it? But Nico and Kelley, it's quite amusing, and it's very sweet. - Have a good night. - Night, all. Sleep well. - We'll catch you in the morning. - Yeah, we'll have a good day tomorrow. - Thanks. - See you later. - Thought you were going to bed? - Work first, friendship second, women third. The battle is on. No matter who wins, friendship doesn't change. - Oh, no, no. - Or I'll have you scrubbing the hull. - You did it. - Yeah. - Give me a hug. That was incredible. We're all done. - I couldn't have done it without you, honestly. - This--I'm just really upset. I just wanted to f---ing, like, go home, like... - Whoo, unbelievable. - How was it? Was it? - Awesome. - You are most welcome. That was a fantastic meal. - One, two, three. - It was a pleasure and a privilege, cheers. - Thank you. - Enjoy. - We had a good time. - Good night. - Better make it a night. The 12-course meal might be the way forward, 'cause it keeps the guests at the table for so long, by the end of it, they're begging to go to bed. It's genius. - All right, hon, I'm off to bed. - All right, honey bun. It's not cool. It's just not. - Are you okay? - Oh, I don't know. - She's not happy. - Listen... - Just chill. It's all good. - You're not the chef on this boat. There's no reason you should feel bad about anything that happened this evening. You're a hard worker. You have a positive attitude. - You dealt with a very stressful situation tonight. It was 12 courses. The old school of cooking was brutal. You know, we used to get plates thrown at us, sauce pans around the back of the f---ing head. - I know, I know. - I mean, you know, obviously, I was stressed out about it. Now it's like, if I shout at someone it's like "Oh, God." - I can't deal with this. It's so f---ed up. - If you're sensitive, stay out of the f---ing kitchen. - I'm over it. - Try and just get through the next few days. - This negative energy, like, this is not for me. - Next on "Below Deck"... - Sierra, she, like, broke down last night. She lost it. - I don't want her to become discouraged. - Absolutely. - I can't wait to come home. - We will be getting our new deckhand. - For this shadow? - Yep, he's pretty green. - Oh, f---. - Like, under that cabinet, like, under? - We just met, Sierra, you're making me bend over already? - No, no, you're-- - Sierra's looking nice. She has the Alaskan face. - I turned into the freak--freak machine. - Oh, my God, he just tried to kiss me. He just tried to... - Come in. - But I find you so attractive. - F---, you all right, Kyle? Is he all right? What happened? - You all right? - F---ing hell. - Oh, my God. Holy sh--. - For more "Below Deck," go to:
