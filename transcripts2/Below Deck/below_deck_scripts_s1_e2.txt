 YOU WERE KIND OF STANDOFFISH. - NO. - BULL[bleep]. SHE'S MAKING THINGS AWKWARD BETWEEN US. - I'M BUSTING MY ASS ALL DAY. - NO, YOU'VE BEEN SITTING AROUND CHITCHATTING. - YOU ARE SO RIGHT. - DON'T GET A [bleep] ATTITUDE, 'CAUSE THEN IT WILL GET BAD. - ANDREW'S PORTHOLE WAS LEFT OPEN WHILE WE WERE TRAVELING. - YOU'RE STARTING TO SCARE ME, ANDREW. - I'M SCARED TOO.

NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER OPENED A PORTHOLE ON A BOAT. IT'S BEEN IN REVERSE THE WHOLE TIME. THE FRICKEN-- [indistinct] - HOLD ON, BABY! - YOU HAVE THREE SISTERS, DON'T YOU? - TWO. - ALWAYS WANTED A "SISTAH." - AWW. - I MADE KELLEY MY SISTER. I PUT MAKEUP AND, LIKE, CURLERS IN HIS HAIR ALL THE TIME. - THAT'S FUNNY. - ON A YACHT, YOU GET TO KNOW YOUR CREW MEMBERS SO WELL. SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW DAYS, I ALMOST FEEL SOME OF THEM ARE ALREADY LIKE FAMILY. YOU KNOW, KELLEY AND I, WE WERE ALL WE HAD FOR A WHILE. - REALLY? - AND, LIKE... MY DAD HAD HIS MIDLIFE CRISIS AND LEFT, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, MY MOM WAS LIKE AN EMOTIONAL WRECK AND DIDN'T GET OUT OF BED FOR DAYS. - WOW, REALLY? - THEY HAD BEEN SUCH A CONSTANT AND IT WAS SO SHOCKING HOW MUCH IT WENT FROM, LIKE, GOOD TO BAD WITH THEM. GROWING UP THEY WERE OUR EVERYTHING, AND WHEN THEY SPLIT UP, MY WORLD WAS GONE. FOR KIDS, YOUR IDENTITY IS LIKE THE FAMILY. AND WHEN THAT'S GONE, IT'S LIKE, WHO AM I? - HOW OLD WERE YOU THEN? - 17. - OH, THAT'S AN AWFUL TIME. - BUT AT LEAST I HAD A CAR, BECAUSE I TOOK KELLEY AND I TO SCHOOL, AND, LIKE, PICKED HIM UP. KELLEY AND I COULD RELY ON EACH OTHER. THAT IS WHY WE ARE AS CLOSE AS WE ARE. AND, NOW, IT HAS BEEN TEN-PLUS YEARS THAT WE'VE EVEN LIVED TOGETHER. - REALLY? - BUT I THINK I HAD TO GET OUT OF TEXAS TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHO I AM. KELLEY AND I HAVE BOTH CHANGED A LOT SINCE WE'VE LIVED UNDER THE SAME ROOF. BUT WE HAVE BOTH MANAGED TO SEE THAT THERE IS A MUCH BIGGER WORLD OUT THERE THAN SMALL-TOWN TEXAS, AND I'M REALLY THANKFUL FOR THAT. - HE'S SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. - OH, I FEEL SO LUCKY TO HAVE HIM. I REALLY DO. - WOULD YOU GIRLS LIKE ANYTHING? SNACKS OR-- - NO, GOSH. - YOU'RE OKAY FOR THE MOMENT? - WHAT WE WANT IS SOME BEEFCAKES UP HERE, IF YOU GOT ONE OR TWO HANGING OUT. - BEEFCAKES? - YEAH. - I JUST THINK, YOU KNOW, I'LL RADIO BEN AND I CAN GET THAT UP ON A PLATE FOR HER RIGHT AWAY. - SOME GOOD-LOOKING GUYS. THE GUYS ARE GONE. WE WANT GEISHA BOYS TO WAIT ON US. - OKAY, SO YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU-- LIKE, ORDER SOME MEN? - WE DON'T WANT YOU TO IMPORT THEM IN. - I'VE NEVER HAD A REQUEST LIKE THIS. ANDREW, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE TO COME TO THE STEW PANTRY? BUT I'VE NEVER HAD AN ANDREW EITHER. IT'S JUST THE LADIES ON THE SUN DECK. THEY JUST WANT TO KIND OF CELEBRATE, LIKE, THE WHOLE CABANA BOY THEME, YOU KNOW? - OKAY, OKAY. - SO DO YOU HAVE ANY SMALL POLOS AND SMALL T-SHIRTS AVAILABLE? ANDREW'S GOING TO COME DOWN AND CHANGE. - MY DECKHAND SKILLS, I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO ON THAT. BUT THIS IS ONE OF MY STRONG SUITS AND I'M JUST GLAD THAT I CAN BRING THIS TO THE TABLE. - WE NEED SOME STRIPPER MUSIC OR SOMETHING. - IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN GET A LITTLE BIT OF STRIPPER MUSIC FOR THIS? I MEAN, RESPECTABLE DANCER MUSIC FOR THIS? - OH, BOY. - GIVE Y'ALL A MIX OF MONEY. - AWW. [laughter] - LADIES. all: WHOO! - THIS FOR ME? - SEE THAT POLE? - OH, YES. - WHY DON'T YOU START BY GETTING UP THERE? - WHOO! - TAKE A VIDEO. [all cheering] RIDE 'EM, COWBOY! - ANDREW LOVES THAT ATTENTION. HE EATS IT UP, AND THAT'S WHY WE THREW HIM TO THE WOLVES. [cheering] - GOOD JOB. - GOOD JOB. - HE'S A MORON. - THAT WAS WORTH AT LEAST $50. GOOD JOB. - WHOO! - OH, MY PAYMENT. - THERE YOU GO. - COME IN. - HOW ARE YOU? - MY LOVE. - HOW'S IT GOING? - GOOD. - IT SEEMS LIKE-- - WELCOME TO MY LAIR. - I KNOW. I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN IN HERE. IT'S WICKED. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ALL THIS EXTRA SPACE? YOU SHOULD, LIKE, RUN A GYM OR SOMETHING. KAT WAS ADORABLY AWFUL ON MOTOR YACHT HONOR. - WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO? - AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ENTERTAINED BY IT. - YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO KEEP THINGS PROFESSIONAL RIGHT NOW. - I KNOW, I CAN SEE THAT. - YOU KNOW, I NEED TO. - ALMOST A LITTLE TOO PROFESSIONAL. - TOO PROFESSIONAL? - WELL, I WAS HOPING TO, YOU KNOW, BREAK THE RULES A LITTLE BIT. - BREAK THE RULES. - BEND THE RULES. - BEN AND I HAD A HISTORY, BUT I HAVE A BOYFRIEND. HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND. SO I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A NORMAL RELATIONSHIP. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO INVOLVE SEX. THERE IS A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL, AND THE LIGHT IS MY BOYFRIEND'S FACE. SO I'VE JUST GOT TO GET THROUGH THAT TUNNEL AND DON'T LOOK AROUND. I'M ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE CAPTAIN NOW. SINCE IT'S THE FIRST CHARTER, REALLY TRYING TO, LIKE, GET TO KNOW HOW EVERYONE WORKS, YOU KNOW? - WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ANDREW? - ANDREW'S A COMPLETE TOOL. - HE'S THE HOTTEST GUY ON THE SHORT BUS. KATE IS WICKED. - YEAH, SHE REALLY IS. - AND SHE TALKS TO ME REALLY WELL. AND SHE COULD WRITE A BOOK ON HOW TO STROKE A CHEF'S EGO. - THAT SOUNDS PERVERTED, AND I'M NOT SURE KATE'S REALLY BEN'S TYPE. - BE COOL, AND I WANT TO SEE THAT SMILE MORE. - YEAH, OKAY. - YOU LITTLE BUGGER. - DON'T INTERRUPT ME ON MY BREAK ANYMORE. - HEY, LADIES. - HELLO. - OH, GIRL! - Y'ALL LOOK SO CUTE IN YOUR PAJAMAS. - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? - OH, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR Y'ALL. I DIDN'T REALIZE Y'ALL WERE HAVING A PJ PARTY IN HERE. THIS WOMAN IS LIKE MY KINDRED SPIRIT. - ALL RIGHT, HERE YOU GO. IT'S TIME, SORRY. - SHE'S A WOMAN LIKE I HOPE TO BE AT HER AGE. I AM FROM TEXAS WHERE THEY WEAR THE RED LIPSTICK, THE BIG HAIR, SO I'M JUST USED TO POPPING IT ON, YOU KNOW? - GIRL, THAT'S WHAT WE GOT GOING ON. - THE BIGGER THE HAIR, THE CLOSER TO GOD. THAT'S WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY IN TEXAS. - EDDIE, EDDIE. LEE. - HEY. - YEAH, WHAT'S YOUR ANCHOR SCHEDULE LOOK LIKE? - I'M ON ANCHOR WATCH UNTIL 7:00. ANCHOR WATCH CAN BE A VERY TOUGH SHIFT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT, LIKE, GOING TO SLEEP WHEN YOU NEED TO. IF YOU'RE AN ANTSY PERSON, YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT SLEEPING DURING THE DAY, YOU KNOW, IT CAN BE TOUGH BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE UP ALL NIGHT. SO, YEAH, IT'S A PAIN, BUT THAT'S PART OF THE JOB. - CRAMP, CRAMP. - WHERE? - MY BICEP. - I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU STRETCH OUT A BICEP, TRUTHFULLY. - YOU'RE, LIKE, "OH, OH." - NO, IT'S JUST-- - "I'VE GOT TO STRETCH OUT MY BICEPS. I'M GETTING--" - "DID YOU SEE MY BEACH BALL? DID IT GO THAT WAY OR THAT WAY?" - KELLEY'S JUST LIKE A BIG PIECE OF MEAT. I HAVE TO GET AN M&M.; OH, GOD. - OH, THE ONLY THING I WISH I HAD RIGHT NOW IS MY DOG. MY DOG COULD FIT, LIKE, PERFECTLY RIGHT HERE AND I WOULD JUST HOLD HIM AND PASS THE [bleep] OUT. MY GIRLFRIEND, SHE GOES, "WHAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING YOU'RE GOING TO MISS?" AND I GO, "MY DOG." I-I'VE KNOWN HER FOR A MONTH AND A HALF. THERE'S NO WAY THAT I'M GOING TO SAY HER OVER MY DOG. RIGHT NOW, I AM CASUALLY DATING SOMEONE, BUT WE ARE IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DATING GUIDELINES FALL IN THERE. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. AND I DO HAVE A HISTORY OF DATING MY COWORKERS, YES. YOU DON'T EVEN GO UP TO MY MIDDLE KNUCKLE. [laughter] - IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE A LITTLE PICNIC. - I [bleep] HATE BEACH PICNICS. I SHOULD MAKE WHAT I'M MAKING IN A MONTH JUST DOING THIS FOR A DAY. - SHE'S COMPLAINING ABOUT EVERYTHING. - THIS IS RIDICULOUS. - DON'T MAKE ME HATE YOU. - UGH! - EDDIE, EDDIE. LEE. GRAB KELLEY AND GET THE WATERLINE CLEAN, PLEASE. - WE'RE CLEANING THE WATERLINE. - ALL RIGHT, WE ABOUT READY FOR THIS? - I'M ABOUT READY. - THE WATERLINE ACTUALLY GETS DIRTY PRETTY OFTEN AND I LEAD BY EXAMPLE AND SO IF THERE'S A JOB AT HAND THAT NEEDS TO GET DONE, I'LL GET IT DONE. - ARE YOU MISSING YOUR GIRL BACK HOME? - YEAH, I DEFINITELY MISS MY GIRL A LOT. - IT'S HARD BEING AWAY FOR THIS LONG. - YEAH, DEFINITELY. - AND THEN, LIKE, THE BOATS THAT I WORK ON BACK HOME, YOU KNOW, I'M, LIKE, AWAY FOR TWO WEEKS AT A TIME ALSO, SO BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE, I HADN'T SEEN HER FOR A WHILE ALREADY. YOU KNOW, LIVING ON A BOAT WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER GIRLS REALLY PUTS A LOT OF STRESS ON A RELATIONSHIP. I MEAN I'VE GOT TO KEEP THE LADIES AT BAY SOMETIMES. YOU KNOW? I NEED TO GET A CATTLE PROD SOMETIMES. GET BACK. - THAT'S PROBABLY THE [bleep] THING. I MISS MY GIRL AND I MISS MY DOG. - YEAH, DUDE. - I WANT TO KNOW WHO'S GOING TO HOOK UP WITH WHO ON THIS FREAKIN' CHARTER. - I THINK ANDREW WILL HOOK UP WITH SOMEBODY. - I THINK SO. - YEAH! YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, MAN. - I THINK, IF ANYTHING... - WHAT? - SHE--SHE DID NOT TELL ME SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND. - [laughs] NO! OH, WELL THEN! - HOLY [bleep]. THAT'S INTERESTING. SHE DIDN'T MENTION THAT TO ME. NOW... - YEAH. - ANDREW, WHAT'S YOUR 20? ANDREW? DOES ANYBODY HAVE EYES ON ANDREW? ANDREW, WHAT THE [bleep] IS GOING ON? SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO GET STABBED. - YEAH, I JUST DIDN'T HAVE MY EARPIECE IN. - YOU GOT UP AT WHAT, 6:50? YOU GOT TO BE ON DECK AT 6:00. ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, I WAS JUST-- - YOU NEED TO GET UP EARLIER. - OKAY. I DON'T GET TO MAKE MY OWN SCHEDULE. IT IS UP TO THEM WHEN I EAT, SLEEP, FART, WHATEVER. - HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING? YOU GUYS READY TO HAVE SOME MORE FUN? - ABSOLUTELY. WE'RE GOING TO DO THE BATHS TODAY. IT'S A REALLY UNIQUE GRANITE STRUCTURE, GRANITE BOULDERS, AND JUST GORGEOUS, LITTLE SANDY BEACHES. AND THEN WE HAVE A LITTLE PICNIC LUNCH FOR YOU ON THE BEACH. - IT'S GONNA TO BE LIKE A LITTLE PICNIC. WE'RE GOING TO DO COOL, LITTLE SANDWICHES AND STUFF. RIGHT? - UH-HUH. - YEAH. - IF I WAS GOING TO HAVE A BEACH PICNIC, I'D WANT ME TO SET IT UP. THE SECRET IS A CHECKLIST. BECAUSE IF YOU GET TO THE BEACH AND YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ONE SPOON, THE WHOLE BEACH PARTY, IT'S ALL FOR NOTHING. - SO AM I GOING TO COME TO THE BEACH WITH YOU? - YEAH. - I [bleep] HATE BEACH PICNICS. - I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE FLIES. - I KNOW, YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THAT. - DO WE NEED MAYONNAISE? - NO. - YOU KNOW, THE CHECKLIST IS [bleep] THREE PAGES LONG. I'M JUST, LIKE, [bleep] IT. THIS IS HELL. OH, MY GOD, THIS IS GOING TO BE SUCH A PAIN. YOU HAVE TO GET ALL THIS STUFF TOGETHER. EVERY GODDAMN THING YOU CAN THINK OF FROM YOUR FORK, TO YOUR MAYONNAISE, TO YOUR KETCHUP, TO YOUR BEER, TO YOUR VODKA, TO YOUR PLATES, TO YOUR TABLE LINENS. IT'S A GODDAMN NIGHTMARE. ARE WE BRINGING MAYONNAISE? NO. - NO. WELL, YOU JUST ASKED THAT. COME ON. GET WITH THE PROGRAM. - I DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER. - NO. - SHE SAID, "NO." - OKAY, ALREADY. WE DON'T NEED MAYO. I DON'T NEED EVERYONE PILING ON ME. ALL RIGHT, TABLECLOTH, MAIN PLATES-- - WAIT, STOP. THE PURPOSE OF THE LIST IS TO SEE THAT WE HAVE IT. - I DON'T WANT TO CARRY ALL THIS STUFF. THAT WASN'T IN THE CONTRACT. I SHOULD MAKE WHAT I'M MAKING IN A MONTH JUST DOING THIS FOR A DAY. - DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT PART OF THE JOB IS HAVING BEACH PARTIES AND MAKING DRINKS? SHE'S COMPLAINING ABOUT EVERYTHING. - THIS IS RIDICULOUS. - NO, NOT THAT MUCH. IT'S ANNOYING. - I'D DO ANYTHING TO TAKE A NAP RIGHT NOW. - HEY. - HEY, ANDREW. - WHAT'S THAT COOLER FOR? - A BEACH PARTY. - RIGHT, I'M--SEE? - SO YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE GROUP IS GOING TO THE-- WELL, THE GUEST ARE GOING TO THE BATHS TODAY? - RIGHT. - YOU EVER BEEN THERE? - THE BATHS. OH, NO, I HAVE NOT. IT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL THOUGH. - IT IS AN AMAZING PLACE. IT REALLY IS. - I DOUBT I'M GOING. - THERE IS A CREW MEMBER THAT IS GOING, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE YOU, MAN. YOU HAVEN'T STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE YET. - I KNOW. I LOOK CUTE RIGHT NOW. - NO, YOU DON'T. TAKE THAT OFF YOUR HEAD. YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. - WHO'S GOING ANYWAYS? - JENNICE. - OH, SHE DESERVES IT. - SHE DOES. GETTING OFF THE BOAT AND GOING ASHORE AND HANGING OUT WITH THE GUESTS IS A TREAT. IF YOU DESERVE IT, YOU GET TO DO IT, AND THAT'S WHY ANDREW CAN'T DO IT. IF YOU WANT TO GO ON THESE EXCURSIONS WITH GUESTS, AND YOU WANT TO SCHMOOZE WITH GUESTS, YOU NEED TO DO YOUR FIRST JOB, AND THAT IS CLEANING THIS BOAT. WORK COMES FIRST. SO, I WANT YOU TO DO THE WINDOWS ON THE BRIDGE. BY WATCHING ANDREW, I'M LEARNING THAT HE REALLY HAS NO WORK ETHIC OR MOTIVATION. MY JOB IS RIDING ON THIS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T AFFORD RIGHT NOW. GET IT DONE. - SURE THING. - ALL RIGHT, MAN. - WIPE DOWN THE TENDER REAL QUICK, GET IT GUEST-READY. - SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUR PRIVATE TOUR GUIDE? - I'M GOING TO TRY. HAVE YOU BEEN HERE TO VIRGIN GORDA BEFORE? NEITHER HAVE I. - NONE OF THEM HAVE EVER BEEN. - SO WE'LL ALL EXPERIENCE IT TOGETHER. - I'VE STILL GOT TIME, RIGHT? - YOU HAVE AN HOUR AND 15. - AND THAT'S IT. - YEP. - BYE-BYE. - ENJOY. - BYE-BYE. - ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TAKE IT EASY, NOW. - AND THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME TOO? - IT IS, YEAH. - IF YOU'RE FEELING LIKE YOU WANT TO EXPLORE, WE CAN DO IT. - OKAY, I'M GONNA PULL OUT OF HERE. - TALL IS-- - JEEZ! [laughter] - WATER. [indistinct chatter] - DON'T GO TOO DEEP. - ONE, TWO, THREE. all: AH! - [bleep]. - I'LL GIVE YOU A CHOPPING BOARD AND A KNIFE. JUST CUT THE SANDWICHES INTO KIND OF THREE. I'M NOT FREAKING OUT. DON'T WORRY. - IT'S NOT FREAKING OUT, BUT THERE IS A SENSE OF URGENCY. - YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME TO THE BEACH? - NO, LOVE. I HATE THE BEACH. - HOW DID YOU GET INTO ALL THIS? - I WANTED TO TRAVEL, AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY AND TRAVEL AT THE SAME TIME. - YOU'RE A SMART GIRL. - I WORK ON DECK, SO IT'S VERY PHYSICALLY DEMANDING, ESPECIALLY-- - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - I WORK WITH THE BOYS. - WHO IS YOUR ROOMMATE? - KELLEY. - OH, KELLEY'S YOUR ROOMMATE. - GOT MYSELF SET UP NICE, DON'T I? - YOU DID. NICE WORK. - AMY? - YEAH? - YOU EVER GET, LIKE, HOMESICK AND JUST, LIKE, WANT TO GET OFF THE BOAT AND, LIKE--JUST PEOPLE AND STUFF? - OH, MY GOSH. YEAH, OF COURSE, ESPECIALLY LIKE-- - I'M SERIOUSLY, LIKE, OVERWHELMED AS HELL. - OH, HONEY. - MY FAMILY IS A VERY CLOSE-KNIT FAMILY. SO BEING AWAY FROM PEOPLE THAT I CAN JUST RELY ON AND I KNOW INSIDE-OUT AND I JUST FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IS HARD. I WENT TO BOARDING SCHOOL AS A KID. I JUST--I WAS, LIKE, "YEAH, BOARDING SCHOOL, "I'M AWAY FROM MY PARENTS, LIKE, ALL MY FRIENDS ARE HERE. THIS IS SO SICK." AND THEN, LIKE, BY THE THIRD NIGHT, IT JUST DAWNED ON ME, LIKE, "I'M ALL ALONE." LIKE, "WHERE'S MOM? WHERE'S DAD? WHERE'S, LIKE-- WHERE'S MY DOG?" THE BOAT THAT I WORKED ON PREVIOUSLY WAS A FAMILY FRIEND. IT'S JUST--IT'S QUITE EASYGOING COMPARED TO THIS BOAT WHERE I'M PRETTY SURE EVERYBODY WANTS TO KILL ME. - WE ALL HAVE TO BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW? SO IT'S LIKE YOU JUST BECOME, LIKE, FAMILY. IT'S REALLY HITTING HOME, BECAUSE, YES, I'VE GOT KELLEY ON THE BOAT WITH ME WHICH HAS BEEN SO COOL TO RECONNECT AND WORK TOGETHER, BUT WE LOST TOUCH FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE AND THERE WAS A TIME I SPENT ALMOST A YEAR IN THE CARIBBEAN. SO I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHERE HE'S COMING FROM AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO HIM. IT'S JUST GOING TO SPEED BY. - I LIKE YOU. - YOU KNOW? - I REALLY, REALLY LIKE YOU. YOU'RE AWESOME. - LIKEWISE. SO YOU'VE GOT THIS. - EXCITING. - A HAND DOWN. OH! - I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SHARE ANY SUGAR-FREE RED BULL WITH THE GUESTS. I WANT IT ALL FOR MYSELF. - THEY'RE DOING SOME GIFT SHOPPING AND THEN WE'LL BE TO THE DOCKS IN ABOUT MAYBE TEN MINUTES. - OKAY, PERFECT. THANKS. - PERFECT? - HAMMER DOWN, HUH? - OH, MY GOD, THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG FREAKIN' DAY AT THE BEACH. - GUESTS ARE COMING, STUFF'S NOT READY AND KAT IS COMPLAINING A LOT. SO YOU WANT TO LADLE THE GAZPACHO? - UGH! - AND I WAS SAD INSIDE BECAUSE I'M THINKING, "I LIKE YOU AS A PERSON, DON'T MAKE ME HATE YOU." I'M GOING TO FINE YOU A QUARTER EVERY TIME YOU SAY SOMETHING NEGATIVE. - YOU KNOW, I COULD BE NEGATIVE FOUR TIMES AND THAT'S ONLY A DOLLAR. AND I'M ONLY SAYING WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS THINKING. NOBODY WANTS TO BE AT THIS BEACH PICNIC. - ONE OF YOU GIRLS GONNA HAVE TO LET ME KNOW WHEN TO GO GET THE SORBET ALSO. - SORBET? - SORBET. - OH, DID YOU FORGET SPOONS? - IT MAKES ME MORE FUN. - OH, HERE THEY ARE. - [bleep]. THERE'S, LIKE, LITTLE GNATS ON THOSE. UGH. - EW. - THIS IS A FINE LINE BETWEEN TOO LATE AND TOO SOON. - ACTUALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT HOW Y'ALL KNOW EACH OTHER. - KAT AND I WORKED ON A BOAT TOGETHER. - CAN YOU MAKE THAT STORY A LITTLE BIT LONGER WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL? - HEY! - WELCOME TO THE BEACH. - HOW WERE THE BATHS? - GREAT. GREAT. - LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. - WHY DON'T START OFF WITH SOME COCKTAILS IF YOU'D LIKE? - GOOD. NO HUG FOR ME? REALLY? - HEY, KELLEY. - THE BEST SISTER IN THE WORLD. WHOO! - IS EVERYONE HUNGRY? all: YES. - BEN PREPARED A GAZPACHO AND ALSO LOBSTER TAIL. all: OH! - WE'RE TALKING, NOW, HUH? - HE SAID TO TOP IT WITH JUST A SPLASH OF VODKA. - HERE'S TO THAT. - JUST A SPLASH. - JUST A SPLASH, OKAY. - I'VE NEVER HAD LUNCH WITH QUITE THIS VIEW. - IT DON'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. - HEY, SMILE. - PEOPLE KEEP TRYING TO TAKE PICTURES OF ME AND THEM, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T LIKE PICTURES OF ME. - LOOK AND SMILE. SMILE. YOU CAN SEND IT TO YOUR BOYFRIEND. - SO KELLEY FOUND OUT I HAVE A BOYFRIEND. HMM. - THAT'S A GOOD ONE. - SOMETIMES, THERE ARE PEOPLE IN LIFE THAT YOU MEET AND YOU ALREADY KNOW THEM, AND KELLEY'S ONE OF THEM. - GOD, IT'S PRETTY HERE. - YEAH. - THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A CONNECTION THERE BETWEEN US. BUT, YOU KNOW, FOR HER NOT TELLING ME SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ON YOUR DAY OFF? - IF I AM SLEEPING ON A DAY OFF, YOU HAVE FULL RIGHT TO, LIKE, TURN ON ALL THE LIGHTS AND PUSH ME OUT OF MY BED. - NO, BECAUSE I'LL PROBABLY BE SLEEPING BELOW YOU. - WHAT? - YEAH. - I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM MY BOYFRIEND FOR A LONG TIME AND I'VE NEVER REALLY HAD A REAL BOYFRIEND. I'M IN A CONFUSING SITUATION. THAT'S FOR SURE. - I DON'T THINK I'LL END UP MARRYING THIS GIRL THAT I'M WITH NOW, BUT I THINK, FOR NOW, IT'S PERFECT WHERE I'M AT IN LIFE. - SHE'S MRS. RIGHT, NOT MRS. RIGHT NOW. OH, NO. both: SHE'S MRS. RIGHT NOW, BUT SHE'S NOT MRS. RIGHT. - YEP. - KELLEY AND JENNICE HAVE BEEN GETTING A LITTLE MORE CLOSE. YEAH, THAT DOESN'T HAVE DISASTER WRITTEN ALL OVER IT OR ANYTHING. NO, SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT [bleep] IDEA. - I'M GOING TO FLIRT WITH YOU, BUT IT'S ALL IN FUN AND GAMES. - DEALING WITH ANDREW IS HARD ENOUGH. I REALLY CAN'T DEAL WITH UNNEEDED DRAMA WITHIN OUR CREW. - YEAH, WHO KNOWS WHERE WE'LL BE IN A YEAR FROM NOW? - RIGHT? - THAT WAS FUN. - YEAH. CHECK THAT OFF THE BUCKET LIST. - THANK YOU. - WELCOME BACK. - HEY, HOW YOU DOING? - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. GOOD TO SEE YOU. - HEY, MY LOVE. MWAH. AND BUMP. - SO COME WORK ON A YACHT AND BE MISERABLE AND SERVE PEOPLE TILL YOUR FINGERS BLEED. - THAT'S 25¢¢. - GET ME THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE. - BEACH PICNICS ARE A NECESSARY EVIL TO ALL CHARTERS. - OH, MY GOD, THAT'S A QUARTER FOR ME. - OKAY, FAIR. - I THINK I COULD DO SOME WORK IN THIS KITCHEN. - RIGHT? HOW WAS YOUR DAY? - LOOKING AT THAT OCEAN WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL TABLE-SETTING AND TENTS AND OUR LOBSTER AND OUR LUNCH, IT WAS PERFECT. - WELL, WE AIM TO PLEASE, BUT WE ARE ALSO REALLY APPRECIATIVE. - HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE ME TO DO THIS? LOOK AT IT. - I THINK FOR DAY THREE, THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS NAPKIN FOLD. OR DO LIKE A REALLY SIMPLE COLUMN. HOW ABOUT THIS ONE? - OH, OKAY. OKAY, MAYBE NOT. - MAYBE A PLEAT. HOW ABOUT A PLEAT? GET CREATIVE. PAPER AIRPLANE. - NO, THAT'S UGLY. - AH, NOT YET. I'M STILL-- AS A CHIEF STEW, I'VE GOT VERY HIGH STANDARDS, BECAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT THE JOB IS. AND SOMETIMES I NEED TO ENCOURAGE MY OTHER STEWARDESSES TO RAISE THEIR STANDARDS. - [bleep]. UGH! OH, MY GOD, THIS IS GOING TO PISS ME OFF. IN KATE'S HEAD EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT. I MEAN, THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE, FOR ME. I LIKE THE SOCIAL ASPECTS OF YACHTING A LOT AND THE ADVENTURES, BUT, WOW, THERE'S SO MUCH WORK. [bleep] THE WORK. IF THIS IS ANYTHING LIKE CHANGING A KIDS' DIAPER, I JUST SHOULD NEVER HAVE CHILDREN. UGH, CAN'T I JUST TIE THIS INTO A LASSOO AND HANG MYSELF RIGHT NOW? IS IT CALLED A LASSOO? I NEED A NAPKIN FOLDING BOOK. UGH. - I'M SURE THERE'S ONE. MAYBE IN HERE. HERE. - OH, LOOK AT THAT. MY PRAYERS WERE ANSWERED. THE SIMPLE ART OF NAPKIN FOLDING. SHE HANDS ME A BOOK. AND THEN I'M READING THE BOOK AND I COULDN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT THE DIRECTIONS. OH, MY GOD. I FELT LIKE I WAS DEAF AND DUMB. HI. - YES, I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY FOLDING THESE NAPKINS. I'M JUST KIDDING. NO, I'M FINE. - WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO? - I'M TRYING TO HELP KAT OUT. SHE'S HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME WITH THE NAPKINS. - DO WE NEED TO FOLD THEM? - WELL, SHE'S GOT A BOOK OUT FOR PETE'S SAKE. I THOUGHT SHE JUST KNEW HOW TO DO IT. - CHARTING A YACHT SHOULD BE THE MOST SPECIAL EXPERIENCE ON THE PLANET. IT IS THE UPPER ECHELON OF SERVICE. - I DON'T KNOW IF I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. - WELL, THAT'S WHY SHE'S GOT THE BOOK. THEY'RE BEHIND, SO WE'RE PROBABLY GOING-- - OH, DO YOU NEED-- - WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU. - THEY'RE NOT PAYING TO FOLD THEIR OWN NAPKINS. THEY'RE PAYING US TO DO IT FOR THEM. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE TIP. - ONE MORE TIME. - ALL RIGHT, KAT, WE'LL SEE YOU SHORTLY. - POTENTIALLY COMMITTING PROFESSIONAL SUICIDE. - I'M GOING IN. - OKAY, GOOD LUCK. - WHERE ARE THEY? - I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. - MISS GEORGIA HAS INSISTED THAT I HAVE DINNER WITH THEM AGAIN THIS EVENING. THE LAST DINNER WAS OVER THE TOP. - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. WHOO-WHOO! [laughter] - I HOPE THAT SHE KEEPS HER ASSETS ON THAT SIDE OF THE TABLE TONIGHT. THAT WOULD BE NICE. - OH, MY GOD. - LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED. - ALL EYES RIGHT UP HERE. WHOO-WHOO. YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL FROM THIS AREA. - CAN I GET YOUR LAST NAME? - ROSBACH. - GEORGIA ROSBACH. - GEORGIA-- - IT'S GOT A LITTLE RING TO IT. - SO IT'S LIKE GEORGIA-- WHOO-WHOO. - I MEAN, COME ON. - YEAH, WHO CARES? - YAY. - THANK YOU. - YOU HAVE A GREAT STAFF. I KNOW YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT. - WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLAINT ABOUT ANYONE. [laughter] - BUT KAT... - GOOD. - OH, YEAH, THEY REALLY HAVE. ENJOY. - HURRY BACK. - OKAY. - [humming] - OH, MY GOD, I'M EXHAUSTED. - WE ARE SO LUCKY THAT OUR FIRST CHARTER GUESTS ARE SO NICE. - DID YOU WAIT TABLES OR BARTEND WHEN YOU WERE, LIKE, IN COLLEGE OR WHATEVER? THERE IS THE KISS OF DEATH, THE VERBAL TIP. WHENEVER SOMEBODY'S A LITTLE TOO COMPLIMENTARY, A LITTLE TOO NICE, THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING. I DON'T WANT YOUR KIND WORDS. KIND WORDS DON'T BUY ME PURSES AND SUNGLASSES. TALK IS CHEAP. BERKINS ARE NOT. - THAT'S THE SCARIEST THING. - IT MIGHT BE-- - I'M HOPING YOU'RE WRONG. - ME TOO. - LAST NIGHT KATHLEEN CAME IN FROM-- - OUR ROOM DID--OH, NO. SHE WAS-- - I KNOW. I HEARD SOME OF IT. BUT SHE GOES, "THEY TOTALLY HAVE A CRUSH ON EACH OTHER." - WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS, BUT NO CRUSH. - LOOK AT YOU BLUSHING. - WELL, BECAUSE YOU'RE CALLING ME OUT. [bleep]. YOU'RE TOTALLY BLUSHING. NEVER. NEVER, NEVER. - OH, MY GOD. - I'M NOT BLUSHING. - SITTING IN A TREE. I DON'T KNOW IF KELLEY AND JENNICE ARE GOING TO HOOK UP, BUT I AM REALLY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIENDS. BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT. - WE'RE ADULTS NOW TOO. LIKE, RELEARNING HOW EACH OTHER IS AS AN ADULT LIVING TOGETHER. - THE LAST TIME I, LIKE, REALLY SPENT, LIKE, QUALITY TIME, LIKE, ME AND MY SISTER BONDING, WAS 12 YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS, LIKE, DRIVING ME TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY BEFORE SHE LEFT FOR COLLEGE. AND THAT WAS HARD FOR ME. I'M JUST TRYING TO, LIKE-- [farts] - DID YOU POOT? - NO. - OH, MY GOSH, KELLEY. THAT IS SO RANK. SERIOUSLY, I'M ABOUT TO GO TO BED. OH, GOSH! [laughter] [laughter] - OKAY. [screaming] - [gasps] - WHO WAS THAT? - OH, MY GOD. [indistinct chatter] - HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. MOVE AWAY, PLEASE. - OH, GOD! - ANDREW. EDDIE. ONE OF THE CHARTER GUESTS LOVES CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. PLEASE MAKE SOME. [knock on door] - HEY, BEN. - YEAH? HELLO? - HEY, BEN. - YEAH, WHO'S THAT? COME IN. - HEY, BRO. DON'T SHOOT THE MESSENGER. - SURE, WHAT DO YOU WANT? - SOME GUEST IS REQUESTING THAT THEY HAVE SOME CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES FOR LIKE A SNACK TONIGHT. - THAT'S FINE. - OH, I FEEL LIKE I FEEL BETTER AT THIS POINT.

THAT COULD'VE BEEN MY FACE. - [chuckles] ALL RIGHT, I'M UP. - THANKS AGAIN, FOR NOT PUNCHING ME IN MY NOSE. I NEED IT TO BREATHE. I NEED IT TO BREATHE. - WE ARE UP AND LOCKED. - OKAY, WE'RE OUT OF HERE, GANG. - I HAD WASHED A BLACK SKIRT AND PAIR OF JEANS THAT WERE IN THE DRYER. - EVERYTHING I TOOK OUT OF THAT DRYER WAS WHITE. - KAT AND I, LIKE, IT'S BEEN INTERESTING GETTING BACK TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER. I FORGET HOW REALLY GOOD FRIENDS WE WERE. IT'S HARD BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE HOW FAR APART WE GOT AND HOW AWKWARD IT GOT BETWEEN US. OKAY, WELL, IT WAS MY BLACK SKIRT FOR TODAY. JUST STUFF WAS IN THE SAME DRYER. - I HAVEN'T TOUCHED ANY LAUNDRY. - ALL RIGHT, LOCK THAT IN. LOCK IT IN, ANDREW. TAKE A WRAP ON IT. - HEY? - TAKE A WRAP. - TAKE A WRAP? - TAKE A WRAP.

HE SHOULD KNOW THIS. SOMETHING'S WRONG. SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT WITH THIS GUY. - HOW SMOOTH DO YOU THINK THAT WENT? - THAT WAS ABOUT AS SMOOTH AS SANDPAPER. - A LITTLE ROUGH, RIGHT? I THOUGHT SO. - A LITTLE ROUGH? THAT [bleep] SUCKED. - THAT WAS PRETTY BRUTAL. - I'M SO READY FOR THIS CHARTER TO BE OVER. ARE WE GOING TO DRINK WINE TONIGHT? - WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING GOING ON TOMORROW GUEST-WISE. THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T GO OUT. - THERE'S OUR GROUP. - WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE Y'ALL. ONE MORE DRINK. CHEERS, Y'ALL. - THANK YOU. - WE HAD A BALL. - WE'RE GOING TO MISS YOU GUYS. - IT'S THE BEST VACATION WE'VE EVER HAD. - THIS SEASON IS STARTING OFF AMAZING. WE PULLED OFF THIS GREAT FIRST CHARTER AND HOPEFULLY IT'S ONLY GOING TO GO UP FROM HERE. - THERE ARE NO WORDS. I'VE GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU, TOO. - OH, THANK YOU. IT WAS CERTAINLY A PLEASURE HAVING YOU ONBOARD. - WELL, THANK YOU. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - THANK YOU. - CHEERS. - THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN, Y'ALL. - ATTENTION ALL CREW. I NEED EVERYBODY DOWN IN THE CREW MESS ASAP. - I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE TIP. I REALLY HOPE IT'S JUST NOT VERBAL. - SO, HOW DID YOU GUYS THINK THE CHARTER WENT? - GREAT. - JENNICE, YOU'RE NO LONGER THE JUNIOR DECKHAND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. ALL IN ALL, I THINK THE CHARTER WENT REALLY, REALLY WELL. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF AREAS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO WORK ON. AND I THINK-- 15 LARGE TO SPLIT UP. all: OH! - BLOW OFF SOME STEAM? FAIR ENOUGH? - THEY LEFT US $15,000. HEY! FIRST CHARTER. BOOM! - $1,300 EACH. AMAZING. - I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER LOOKED AT THIS MUCH MONEY AT ONE TIME. - THANK YOU. - LADIES. - I COMPLETELY MISJUDGED GEORGIA AND HER FRIENDS. NOT ONLY WERE THEY KIND AND SWEET AND COMPLIMENTARY, BUT THEY ALSO TIPPED US QUITE GENEROUSLY. - KELLEY, THANK YOU, SIR. NICELY DONE. EDDIE, GOOD JOB. THANK YOU. - THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. AND I'M OUT OF HERE. - DON'T GO RUNNING OFF, EDDIE, I'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY. MY POLICY ON TIPS, EVERYBODY GETS AN EQUAL SHARE AND IF YOU DON'T DESERVE AN EQUAL SHARE, YOU ALSO GET A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA IN YOUR PAY ENVELOPE ALONG WITH YOUR EQUAL SHARE AND THAT'S A ONE-WAY PLANE TICKET OUT OF HERE. SO, ANDREW, TAKE THAT TO HEART. - YOU'RE SCARING ME, SIR. - YOU WERE CLOSE. - UGH. - ANDREW. - THANK YOU, SIR. - THINK ABOUT IT. - YES, THAT'S ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY. - ALL RIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BE MENTIONING THAT EVER AGAIN. - ANDREW GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIP? - THAT WAS BULL[bleep] , ABSOLUTE BULL[bleep]. - AND TO SEE HIM JUST SMUGLY ACCEPT IT, HAVING DONE [bleep] ALL, IT PISSED ME OFF AND IT PISSED EVERYONE ELSE OFF. AND I'M DAMNED IF IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. - GOOD JOB. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - WHOO! GOOD JOB, TEAM! - LET'S GO AHEAD AND KNOCK SOME STUFF OUT THIS AFTERNOON, GET AS MUCH BUTTONED UP AS WE CAN. YOU GUYS CAN HAVE A LITTLE TIME TO YOURSELVES THIS EVENING. YOU GO BACK AND--FAIR ENOUGH? [all cheering] - WHOO, I'M ALL PUMPED UP. - DUDE, AFTER THIS FIRST CHARTER, MAN, I-- - NO, NOW YOU'VE GOT A TASTE OF THE MONEY-- ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY NOW? IF YOU HAVE A MASSIVE WORK ETHIC, IT'S FORGIVABLE. BUT YOU'VE SHOWED SIGNS OF NOT HAVING A MASSIVE WORK ETHIC, AND THAT'S UNFORGIVABLE. ANDREW IS A BIG [bleep]-UP AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED. YOU DON'T DESERVE THE TIP. SO BASICALLY YOU HAVE MAKING UP TO DO, RIGHT? - YES. YES, OF COURSE. - SO, BASICALLY, YOU OWE US LABOR, RIGHT? - YES, YES. - OKAY. GOOD. SO GO AND WORK YOUR ASS OFF INSTEAD OF STANDING IN HERE. BECAUSE THEN SOMEONE ELSE WON'T HAVE TO DO THAT FOR YOU. - YEAH. NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING A DICK, BUT OKAY. - I KIND OF WANT TO RUN OVER TO THAT BEACH. - LET'S DO IT. - ONE FOOT OFF THE BOAT, TWO FEET ON THE BEACH. - KAT'S BEEN SO NEGATIVE, AND AS HER CHIEF STEW, I JUST KIND OF FEEL LIKE IT'S MY JOB TO, LIKE, SNAP HER OUT OF IT. IT'S KIND OF LIKE A PERSONAL CHALLENGE. LIKE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE MY FRIEND. I JUST WANT TO SIT DOWN AND CHILL OUT. - YEAH, I'D LOVE THAT. - TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE BUT WORK. I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT KAT. BECAUSE, HONESTLY-- - WELL, I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT KAT. KAT WANTS TO GO TO THE BAR. - NO. - KAT COMES FROM AN AMAZING FAMILY, COLLEGE DEGREE. - I ONLY GOT MY COLLEGE DEGREE BECAUSE MY PARENTS WOULD REALLY LIKE IT. BUT DURING COLLEGE I GOT THIS JOB AND I HAD THIS BOSS WHO, LIKE, LOVED ME. I WAS HER PERSONAL ASSISTANT. SHE HAD A SUGAR DADDY. I WALK IN TO MY COMPUTER, MANOLO BLAHNIK SHOE BOX. EVERY DAY AFTER THAT I GOT A NEW PRESENT, WHICH WAS FUN. - THE GIRL WAS GIVING YOU THE PRESENTS? - SHE WAS LIKE 38, REDHEADED AND-- - WAS SHE A LESBIAN? - ISH, BUT NOT WITH ME. - KATE HAD A SUGAR MAMA, WHO HAD A SUGAR DADDY, SO NOW KATE ESSENTIALLY HAS A SUGAR GRANDPA. I'M THINKING, ALL SHE WANTS IS A SUGAR DADDY. - SHE REALLY WAS PSYCHO, SO I LEFT. GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE. I WAS, LIKE, "I'M SPOILED. I'M DRIVING A JAGUAR. I'M A SPOILED BRAT." I WAS, LIKE, "MAYBE I'LL TRY YACHTING. "I'LL PROBABLY END UP DATING, LIKE, AN OWNER'S SON OR SOMETHING." - YEAH, THAT'S REALLY SHALLOW. - I WAS. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HARD WORK WAS. ALL I'D EVER DONE WAS, LIKE, COCKTAIL WAITRESS. HE JUST GAVE ME $100 FOR DELIVERING ONE BOTTLE, YAY! YOU THINK I LOVE CLEANING TOILETS? NO. BUT I'M NEVER GOING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT LETS ME TRAVEL THE WORLD, MAKE TONS OF MONEY, RUB ELBOWS WITH CELEBRITIES AND BILLIONAIRES. IT'S JUST-- THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT. I LIKE YACHTING BUT IT'S JUST SO EXHAUSTING. - WHAT SHIRT? - UGH. - I'VE GOT TAPE FOR YOU. - OKAY, PERFECT. - NO MATTER WHAT, WE STILL LOOK HOTTER THAN WE DO WHEN WE WAKE UP AND CLEAN TOILETS. SO LET'S JUST GO. - CAN YOU PUT THIS ON FOR ME? - SURE. - HERE'S TO AN AMAZING FIRST CHARTER. HERE WE GO. all: CHEERS! - HERE'S TO A GREAT SEASON. - WHOO! - YEAH! - YEAH, DRINK. - I'M GONNA DRINK. - I LOVE IT WHEN YOU HAVE SIBLINGS ON THE BOAT. I THINK THAT'S AWESOME. - I DO TOO. - I LOVE THAT. - SO, EDDIE, SINCE I WAS 14, WE'VE ONLY SEEN EACH OTHER, LIKE, A FEW DAYS AT A TIME. - WHY IS THAT? - SHE WENT TO COLLEGE AND THEN I WENT TO THE MARINE CORPS, AND THEN I GOT HERE AND SHE WAS WORKING ON BOATS. - THAT'S REALLY SPECIAL, THEN. THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO COME OUT HERE AND, LIKE, SPEND THESE SIX, SEVEN WEEKS, YOU KNOW, TOGETHER. - HE'S BEEN REALLY HELPING ME. LIKE, BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON IN THE INSIDE. - ACTUALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT HOW Y'ALL KNOW EACH OTHER. YOU GUYS--YOU TWO. HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN-- - KAT AND I WORKED ON A BOAT TOGETHER. - WHERE? - WE MET IN ARUBA. - YEAH. IT WAS NICE. YEAH. - AH, CAN YOU MAKE THAT STORY A LITTLE BIT LONGER WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL? - ME AND AMY HIT IT OFF RIGHT AWAY. WE COULD TALK ABOUT ANYTHING. GOOD TIMES. - AH, NOTHING, NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT? NO FUNNY STORIES? WHAT HAPPENED? THAT'S A RED FLAG. LIKE, WHAT ARE THEY HIDING? - I'M GOING TO GO SMOKE A CIGARETTE. WITH MY CAT. - IT'S, LIKE, REALLY PEACEFUL HERE, HUH? - YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES THIS ALL THAT MUCH BETTER, IS THAT I'M GETTING TO SPEND TIME WITH MY SISTER. I, LIKE, LITERALLY-- - AWW. I KNOW. - I HAVEN'T--WE HAVEN'T SPENT TIME WITH EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE-- - I KNOW. - GOD. - OH, DON'T CRY, KELLEY. DON'T CRY. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME CRY. KELLEY. I'M, LIKE, SO THANKFUL TO HAVE YOU IN THIS EXPERIENCE, LIKE SOMEONE I CAN COMPLETELY 150% COUNT ON, AND I HATE THAT I WAS NOT THERE FOR YOU. I COULD'VE REALLY HELPED YOU THROUGH, LIKE, MOM AND DAD'S DIVORCE AND, LIKE, ALL THAT, YOU KNOW? - DON'T REGRET ANYTHING. - I KNOW. - YOU'VE MADE IT UP TEN TIMES SINCE THEN. MY SISTER CARES FOR ME. IT, UH, DOES THIS TO ME... BECAUSE I MISS MY SISTER A LOT AND-- I JUST LOVE YOU, EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. - AWW, SERIOUSLY. I LOVE YOU. - YAY. - GREAT [bleep] JOB. GREAT JOB. - COME HERE. - UGH. - I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO HOME IF I GO OUT. OKAY? YOU'RE COMING OUT WITH ME. - ALL RIGHT, LOVE. - THANKS. - ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO THE KICKING. - OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO BREAK THIS SWING. - OH, NO! - [bleep]! - OH, [bleep]! - WHO WAS THAT? - YOU ALL RIGHT? - [bleep]! - OH, GOD! - [bleep]! - HEY BUDDY, WAIT HERE. - HEY, HEY, HEY. HEY, HEY, HEY. - IS THAT MY BROTHER? OH, MY GOD. - MOVE AWAY, PLEASE. - OH, GOD. KELLEY! - NEXT TIME, ON BELOW DECK... - KELLEY HIT HIS HEAD. HE'S GOING TO THE HOSPITAL. DO YOU HAVE A REPLACEMENT? - DO WE NEED A REPLACEMENT? - THAT'S PRETTY [bleep] IGNORANT. - ANY "BITCH WORK" WILL FALL ON ME. - WHAT YOU JUST SAID WAS DEROGATORY TOWARDS WOMEN. - YOU'RE MORE OF A MAN THAN I AM IN THIS JOB. - I'M MORE OF A DECKHAND THAN HE IS. - CHEERS. - CHEERS, LOVE. - KAT AND I DID HAVE A LITTLE THING AND IT'S A REALLY AWKWARD SITUATION BECAUSE WE BOTH HAVE SIGNIFICANT OTHERS. - I'M OUT OF CONTROL! - I'M LOOKING AT ALL THESE CALIFORNIA AUGMENTED WOMEN RELIVING THEIR GLORY YEARS. - I WOULD LIKE KETEL WITH LITTLE STRAWBERRIES AND A LITTLE, MAYBE, LAVENDER SYRUP. - COULD I GET A HARVEY WALLBANGER? - SURE. - A MOJITO FOR ME. - YEAH, SURE, WHATEVER. I'LL THROW SOME [bleep] IN A CUP. AND A BENDY STRAW. I THINK THE BRUNETTE LADY IS A LITTLE HIGH MAINTENANCE. - I HATE TO DO THIS, BUT IT IS WEIGHING ON ME.
