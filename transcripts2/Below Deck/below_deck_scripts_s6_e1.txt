 [percussive music] - Tahiti's gorgeous. I feel like I've stepped back into a land before time. - To be able to charter a yacht here really says something. You talk about prestige. - Whoo! - This one's gonna be nuts. Is this our favorite anchorage? - Yeah. - Every season I come on board, I'm hoping for the best. - Kate, please serve them

 real food. - But, you know, God always gets the last laugh. - Are you kidding? ----ing close the door! - Jesus, it's like a demon's in the master. - I'm not a big fan of babysitting. To me, excuses are just silly ass ----ing reasons for people not doing their goddamn jobs. - Are you listening, Rhylee? I'm very strict on deck. My father being a yacht captain definitely ingrained that into my skull. You don't have to like me, but you will respect me. - How makeup-y is her pillow? I'm a steward, and I pride myself on service.

 ♪ Working, working, always working ♪ I'm a perfectionist in everything that I do. I have nothing to wear. This takes hours. I'm having a bad hair day, which is, in general, just a bad day. - Wait, do you like boys or girls or both? I live for meeting new people. I love to hear other people's opinions. Adrian, mind your own ----ing business. I love it when things get weird. I try to keep it weird. We're all weirdoes. - This looks so pretty. - I would say I'm not the typical yacht chef. I meditate a lot. I do yoga. Omm... I love pushing myself and thinking outside the box. - I love wowing the guests. - It's so yummy. I can't even handle this. I'm so overwhelmed. - I think I heard Ross was on deck already. - He's a go-getter. - I grew up in New Zealand with not much. When I found superyachts, I found something that I was passionate about, and I'm not gonna stop till I get to the top. Got nothing to dress this up? - Why would I have anything to dress her up? - Ooh, wow. - Oh, hello! - I'm definitely not the girl next door. I'm a trucker's daughter, and I spit. I burp. [belches] And I have a temper. I said I got it four ----ing times. - Oh, that Ashton, you gotta keep an eye on him. - I give my everything into my job. - One more champagne and water. I'll turn on the birthday cake. - It was a request for Magnum condoms. - Yachting is long hours and hard work. - We have no towels, no water. - Shut the (BLEEP) up. I'm speaking. - It's a recipe for disaster. - [gasps] - Anybody that I see not taking this seriously... - Oh, my God! - Jesus Christ. - Carefully. - Ohh! - Pack your sh-- and get the (BLEEP) off the boat. - Shall I unroll the one-- - Stop yelling. - And I'm serious as a heart attack. - (BLEEP)! (BLEEP)! - Man overboard. - What? - Oh! - Oh, no! - Come to Tahiti, they said. - It'll be sunny, they said. [boat horn blows] [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ [percussive music] - God damn it! Those waves are huge. - It's a big boat. Nice. Restrained opulence. Like me. ♪ ♪ Hello! - How ya doing, Kate? - I'm good. How are you? - Good. - You look sharp! - Welcome to Tahiti. - Thank you. It looks different on the internet. - It does, doesn't it? - Yeah. - We're gonna have a good time. I mean, exotic location, to say the least. The hurricanes took a devastating toll on the Caribbean, and it's gonna take them a while to recover from it. Tahiti's been on my bucket list for years and years. And while we're all pulling and we all stand behind the Caribbean, we're really excited to be able to charter here this season. I'm hoping the weather breaks, because we got a charter tomorrow. Your crew should be here shortly. You have a steward. Josiah. Qualified butler. - Wait. Is he...for me? - Yeah. - I'm so excited! He's a retired competitive gymnast. Cool. - And then next up, we have Caroline. - A solo stewardess, meaning she can do a little bit of everything, and she's a hard worker. She got her degree in psychology. Do you ever notice girls who major in psychology are usually a little crazy? - [laughs] This is our chef, Adrian. - "My passion is to heal through the creative art of cooking." - [laughing] Good to have ya on board. - Good to be back. I'm gonna go explore. [airy music] Hmm. - Hey-o. - Hi. - Hmm. This is weird. - Nice galley. - Josiah. - Josiah. - What's your name? - Caroline. - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure. - It's nice up here. [light music] - So you're from England. - Yeah. Where are you from? - Ohio. What do you do? - Steward. - Shut up! - What do you do? - That's sick! - A stew! - Sick. - Hey, good morning. - You must be Chandler. - I am, yes, sir. Pleasure to meet ya. - Pleasure's mine. Have a seat. - Drop my bag... - You've been on a few boats. - Yes, sir. - "Bad Influence 2". - That was out of Chicago. - What was "Big Chubby" like? - Fun boat. Smaller boat. A bosun's position's pretty tough. I just want captain to be happy, because the next job I go to, they're gonna want that reference. - You know, I'm pretty basic as far as the way I want the crew to run. We uncover everything before the first guest gets up. Somebody's always up with the late stew. - Okay. - The Pacific is a little different because you get bigger seas. - You got reef everywhere. - Yes. Tahiti is Reef Central because it's so remote. If you screw up here, there's no towboat coming to pull your ass out. I don't like to micromanage. I don't like to babysit. If I've gotta babysit, then you're not the person I need. - Understood. - Okay. That's all I got for right now. - Thank you, sir. - Hey. - Hey, how's it going? - So far? - What's happening? - Ashton. New Zealand? - Yeah, brother. Where you from? - South Africa. - Aw, nice. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Hi! both: Hi! - How are you guys? - Great! How are you? - Good, how's it going? - Caroline. - Kate. Nice to meet you. - Josiah. - Nice to meet you. I saw your resumes. You guys look like you have good experience. You were solo stewardess a lot, which I know is a lotta work. - It--Yeah, it is. - You have bartending experience? - I do, but it's been-- I mean, I'm rusty. I had to go home and tend to family sh--. It is scary to walk on a boat with strangers. You don't know if the personalities are going to jibe. I'm just gonna do my best to be a team player and pull my weight. - And you're pretty-- - Yeah. - What do you think is your strength? - I'd probably say my strength is more like service side. I trained in England at a British butler academy, and I'm a qualified butler with a little bow tie. It's very English, I think. [laughs] - I did put your uniforms in rooms where I think you guys would like to be. Is it Josiah? - Like Messiah, but with a J. - I put you with me, and we're gonna be-- I've never seen this. It's cool. It's like a little-- they call it the penthouse. - Oh, sick. - Caroline, you're in here with a female deckhand. - Okay. - I think she's female. Actually, I don't know. The other rooms are bigger, but I just kinda like-- It feels like we're special being up high. - Yeah. 'Cause I can look down on people! Yeah! Figured you could flip-- - Yeah. I'll just flip up. - Uh-huh. Dismount. - You'll be seeing that a lot. - Hey. - Hey! How's it going? - Good. How are you? - Who are you? - Adrian. I'm gonna be the chef. - Adrian. Caroline, pleasure. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Kate. Welcome aboard. - Thank you. - Um, Adrian... - Tell me. - I have you in here with the bosun. - Beautiful. - Adrian looks really young and malnourished. I'm a little concerned. I just don't think malnourished and chef belong in the same sentence. What do you think of that galley? - It's nice. - Oh, you're so sweet. - [laughing] [both laughing] - [laughing] - Hi! - Ross. - Ross? I'm Rhylee. - Yeah. - Rhylee. Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Ashton. -A-Aston? - Ashton. - Ashton. - Ashton and Ross. Nice to meet you. - Uh, deckhand. - Deckhand. Oh, sweet. Yeah, that's us. - Nice! Okay, good. I'm in like a totally different world of boating. We don't have anything this pretty. I work as co-captain and a mate on fishing charters in Alaska. It's not a lot about the ambiance. It's more about catching that monster halibut. And you get dirty and you get gory and bloody and I love it. - I'm up for anything. A lot of people don't realize Alaskan girls are badass. [laughter] I left my luggage down there. You guys are gonna get 'em? - Yeah. - How you doing? - Hi! - Chandler. - Chandler. I'm Rhylee. - Rhylee? I'm the bosun on board. - You are? I'm one of your deckhands. - You are? Okay. - Yeah. - What's up, brother? - What's going on, man? - Ross. - Chandler. - Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Ashton. - Ashton? Chandler. both: Nice to meet you. - We're just gonna meet, get to know everyone, go over what's going on. So how was everyone's flight? - Long. - Long? Where are you coming from? - South Africa. - South Africa... - New Zealand. - New Zealand. - Alaska. - I'm a Florida boy. Been in the industry full-time about six years. I grew up doing this from like a young age. Father and brother are both captains in the industry. I grew up doing boat deliveries with my father, so this isn't a job for me. It's a career. You know, I'm very relaxed running the deck, but I expect the best out of everyone all the time. I don't like any hierarchy when it comes to the deck group, so everyone's gonna do the same jobs. There's no pecking order. But Chandler's in charge, and I'm not trying to step on his toes. - We're all learning the boat together, so it's gonna be long hours. We just need to make the best of it. But, uh, let's get started. Hey. What's going on? - Hi. How are you? - Hey. - How you doing? Chandler. - Adrian. - Hi, I'm Kate. - Kate. Pleasure to meet ya. - Good handshake. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. How are you? - Good. I'm Rhylee. - Rhylee, Caroline. - This is us, buddy. - So I'll just take this one. - Okay, cool. Hey? [both laughing] [both chuckling] - So I haven't made up my mind about this stew pantry quite yet. For a boat this size, it's surprisingly small. The boat is 180 feet. I was very excited, because I thought bigger stew pantries, bigger crew mess, bigger laundry room. Unfortunately, things down below are not that big. So what--what first-- This is a disaster. It's kind of like if you were dating Shaquille O'Neal and you found out he had a really small penis. And also champagne flutes, if they'll fit. Just for quick grabbing. - Yeah, okay. - If we're not gonna use them-- - And this is fine. You've got espresso cups, small milk jugs... other than having to be like this? - I just don't like-- - We can get rid of these. - I know. - I'd love to get rid of these. - I'm gonna go check out the bilge situation. - Okay. Should I explain what Kate and I said? - I was standing right here. - Were you? When we were talking about this? Didn't even notice. - Uh, yeah, well, you know. I don't have a lot of charisma. Working on a yacht, it is a bit high schoolesque. I think you have to establish who you are off the bat. I'm just standing right next to you! - [laughing] - You're such a dick. - Servers dressed up as cupids. - Holy God. Ashton is obviously ----ing hot. [laughing] - Wow! - You can put those - You can put those back in there. - Just start on this side and work across and... yeah. - I'll get on to it now. - I like a self-sufficient crew. Ross is awesome. - So what do we want out first? - Let's work as a team here, so one will rinse, one will scrub. Cool? - Okay. - Have you used these machines before? - No. - I'll give you a rundown. - Challenges of a new crew: Are they gonna gel with each other, are they gonna get along? - How we looking there, champs? - Looks better. - So far...it's going well. - We should maybe put some white gloves up here. - Good idea. - All crew, all crew. I need everybody in the Sky Lounge in five minutes. - Copy for deck. - Copy for interior. ♪ ♪ - First thing I wanna do is introduce the first officer, Jake, and our engineer's Will and Johan. I have three rules: work hard, don't embarrass yourself, and don't embarrass the boat. - Captain Lee-- his eyes are so intense! He'll just look at you and you're like, yes, sir. - We pay attention to those three rules, we'll get along just fine. We don't... you get a little somethin', somethin' extra in your, uh, tip envelope-- an airplane ticket outta here on Air Tahiti Nui. I've looked at your resumes. Everybody seems competent enough and qualified enough. I personally considered last year to be disastrous. - Watch your boat, watch your boat! [loud thud] - God damn it! - We gotta go with the current. - I'm just listening to what you're telling me. - We're gonna ----ing hit him. We have a much bigger boat. It's no place to be earning your stripes. They have the credentials, but if they don't deliver they can give their soul to Jesus, 'cause their ass belongs to me. Let's go to work. - Understood. [energetic music] - You guys wanna go through beach club? - Yeah. - So this area's like... is kinda one of those places that always needs to be perfect 'cause as soon as we drop the hook, all the toys are goin' out. I'm used to working with seasoned yachties with years of experience. Rhylee's worked on boats before, but they've been fishing boats, so I need to keep an eye on her. - So we got the bosun's locker, the wash locker... - It's not called the bosun locker because we're not allowed in it, right? - Wait, what - Like the bosun locker-- It just sounds like that'd be like your... - Oh, no. It's everyone's. - Like you--Okay. I mean, I know that sounds like a stupid question, but it just... we don't have a bosun on board a fishing boat. [laughter] - Adrian, being from St. Martin, what got you into yachting? You just saw them everywhere? - My father was a yacht captain. He got me pretty involved in it. He just actually passed away three weeks ago. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - I just spent the past couple months taking care of him. He had stage four lung cancer, so it's been...it's been going on for like a year and a half. My father was my best friend. It was just heartbreaking to see him wither away. He didn't take sh-- from anybody. He was just such a strong person. He gave me so much-- so much love, so much empathy. He was just a really beautiful person. So it was a hard past couple of months. - [sighs] Ohh... - All crew, all crew, we have provisions on the stern. ♪ ♪ - To my cabin? - [laughs] Yeah. - Little heavy. ♪ ♪ - Smells like fish! - Uh-oh. Are these Captain Lee's? Are they clean or dirty? - Oh, my God! They're clean. But they're wet. - I'm sorry? - Yeah. You can keep telling me. Don't worry. - Are you in a relationship? - Ashton is definitely a fun piece of man candy. Ashton. - Yeah? - Make sure you rinse really well. [Ashton chuckles] [bright music] ♪ ♪ - Beautiful. Ya-hoo. Come on, baby. - Do you wanna talk about why you like to do charters or what you usually do? - Yeah. I did four years of formal French training and culinary schools in Paris. Right now, I consider myself as a free flow artist. I love blowing people's minds. Look at these cute little desk lights. I'm gonna make desserts and the dessert's gonna be mounted on top of this, and as they eat it, the lights are gonna start shooting out at them. This is how I woo women, usually. - Adrian, Kate, Chandler, I need you guys up to the bridge for a preference sheet meeting. - Copy. - Roger. - How you doing? - Hello, hello. - Ms. Chastain. - Hello. - How's things going? New crew. - I think the crew's amazing. - You really have some good talent there. - Yeah. - How you feel about the galley? - Oh, it'll work good. I'll make it work good. - I like that. - I think I'm very happy. One has a lot more experience than the other, but the one that doesn't have experience has a good attitude so far, so it's great. - So here's who we have for our first charter. - Well, look who it is! - Mr. Foam Man, our primary charter guest. His name is Steve Bradley. They were previous charter guests and Steve's a friend of mine. The reason they call him Foam Man is because he wanted a foam party, and the wind was blowing so bad, we couldn't get it past his ankles. - This is not a foam party. More foam, bosun! Hey, come on, make it happen! - It was just like a malfunctioning carwash. - So I should maybe make a foamy dish. - That's cute. It's kind of nice that we have a returning guest, because I know his preferences, and I know that he'll be blackout drunk most of the time So even if we mess up, he won't remember. - So he and his fiancée Jenn are coming on this charter to celebrate their two-year anniversary and Jenn's 32nd birthday. They want a Polynesian picnic because they wanna do the black sand beach, romantic dinner, and servers dressed up as cupids. - I'm not wearing a diaper. - Heart-shaped birthday cake any problem for ya? - Not at all. - Jet Skiis subject to the amount of sobriety we have. - I mean, what are the alternatives if for some reason we don't leave the dock tomorrow? - We're gonna go with plan B which is probably whatever Kate can come up with. - Okay. - It's a good charter to start off with. - Cool. - That's a wrap. - Thank you, Captain. - Ah, there we go. - Cute, man. Ever since Kai came into my life, I've put him first. - So it's a repeat charter guest, and he's enthusiastic... - Yeah. - Likes alcohol. He also has a lot of requests. It's her 32nd birthday. He wants servers dressed as cupids. Then they want a Polynesian picnic on a black sand beach. But that'll have to be day two, because tomorrow, we're stuck at the dock. Which brings me to another point-- Because we're stuck at the dock all day and it's raining, we have to really entertain them. That's it. - Right. Okay. - Okay. - Welcome to Tahiti. - Good lord! - See you guys at 8:00. You did great. - I'll catch you guys in the morning, all right? Good night. - Steve is coming back, and last time, he was a handful. A drunken handful. [sighs] Bad weather means I do all the work, and the guests are still disappointed, so it's just a lose-lose. ♪ ♪ [groans] - Somebody's birthday? - Aah! Aaaaahhhh! [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Have you seen outside? It's a charter miracle. - So glad I can see blue sky. - You know how to fold toilet paper into a diamond? - Yes. - Okay, that bathroom needs it. There should be cleaning products under these sinks. Each bathroom gets hand towels, conditioner, and shower gel in the shower. - More whisky. - Let's put the excess wine down where the champagne is. The umbrellas, put 'em in that closet. - Okay. - The guests are never the most difficult part of the job, because they leave after a few days. It's always the crew, 'cause you're stuck with them. - It doesn't look like organized, but-- - No, you did a great job. Okay, good. It's really too soon to tell, but so far, so good.

Just let me get it. Here. It's tough, what I do in Alaska, because I am a female captain, which is kind of unheard of. - Can I do it for you? - Pull the line in? - Take it off the cleat first-- - I'm listening to him as he instructs me. To be worthy, I have to prove myself, and in a male-dominated industry, it's not always the easiest. - Okay, three and three. - Oh!

Encourage the deck crew to participate. Also have to make cupid costumes. - Because never behind closed doors we don't have like a factory of minions. - No. I don't wanna put 500 balloons in Steve's room tonight. I just wanna put one sleeping pill in his mouth. - Why don't you get them to wear tighty whiteys? - Captain Lee's? - Yeah. - We have that one-- - There's one here. - And also, you're asking adults to wear diapers.
