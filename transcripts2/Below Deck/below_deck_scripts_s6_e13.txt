 - You're doing me a favor? - It wasn't about-- - Shut the (BLEEP) up. I'm speaking. - Oh. - Is this bitch for real? Here we go again. - This wasn't like this when I came in. - But the master's also like that. Like that, and that was like that. - I don't understand why you're being so aggressive. She needs to learn that you cannot treat people this way. Figure your sh-- out. This is enough. You need to check yourself. Understood? [horn blares] [upbeat music]

 ♪ ♪ This is insane, dude. You need to seriously figure your sh-- out. Have some respect and appreciation for me constantly cleaning up after you all ----ing day. This is enough. There is hundreds of other ways that you could have approached that situation. - Shh. - Like, you go through the cabins before the end of your shift. You had no right to do that. - You told me you were finished. - You need to check yourself. You need to check yourself. Understood? Understood. You're fake, and it's enough. I've had enough. Check yourself. - So do you want to quit? - I want you to check yourself. - Rule number one, don't scream at your superiors in front of charter guests. Rule number two, don't scream at your boss, period. Rule number three, check yourself. - Oh, my (BLEEP). - Hello. - So were you able to hear anything? - No, I heard nothing. - We have an issue. - Okay. - The issue is Laura. She had a temper tantrum. She was ready to scream at me within earshot of the charter guests. The problem started because I asked her to do turndowns. I went and looked. Towels everywhere, empty trashes, bathrooms not done. So I told her, I'm like, "You need to do this," and she was like, "You need to get your sh-- together." I would like you to give her a gentle reminder of the hierarchy of the boat or we can fire her or I'll quit. There are three options. - Seriously? She just got rid of one problem with Caroline, and here's another one. I can't just be pulling stews off fig trees out here. I will have a chat with her in the morning. I don't think chatting with her tonight would do any good. - I don't think so either. - And she'll either get onboard with the program or she won't. - So incredible. Perfectly seasoned. It's delicious. - What time were you up? - 6:00. - You all right? - Am I all right? - That was the wrong question to ask. - Did you hear me yelling, Ross? - Yeah. Try not to yell. I don't know what you're going through, but... - Yeah, no, you don't. - I already told Captain Lee I want to quit. - Why don't you just fire her? Because we can do two charters by ourselves. - You best check yourself. Girl, you better check yourself. - Yeah, you better ----ing check yourself. - You better check yourself. - You better check yourself. (BLEEP) both of you, okay? [laughter] I swear to God, I'm gonna punch everyone in the face. Everybody! - Everyone. - How is everything so far? - Oh, my gosh. This is a palette aphrodisiac. Oh, my gosh. It's so--mmm. Wow. Wow. - They love it. Helen, I think, is in love with you. I was like, "How is everything?" And she went, "Mmm." She was like, "I can taste you--I mean, I can taste the"-- - Did you hear that? - Get ready because there's some emotions out there. Laura was, like, screaming in the galley. - [gasps] - [gasps] - [gasps] - [gasps] - This was outstanding. - You good? - I am just fine. - Feel better? - Yes, but don't laugh at my expense. I was being walked all over and humiliated. Sorry not sorry. - I'm glad you feel better. - Thanks. - Ready. It's so beautiful. - Kahlúa-infused sponge. Dark chocolate ganache. - Can you follow with the last two? Thank you. - Yeah, one second. - Chocolate is ----ing amazing. - I'm already pleased just with the visuals. - So Adrian, for your dessert, has prepared a Kahlúa-infused sponge with a dark chocolate almond ganache. - Where is Adrian? He can watch us bite into this. - Would you like me to go and get him for you? - Yeah, he needs to watch us, like, bite into this. - Adrian, Adrian, Josiah. - Oh, my gosh. Adrian. - The guests just want to see him on the bridge deck aft. Oh, my God, just get a room already. Get it over with. - Oh, my God. - Adrian, I wanted you to witness, like, the first bite. Mmm, that is outstanding. - Great, thank you so much. - Thank you so much. - You're very welcome. - Helen is, like, the best charter guest I've ever seen. - I love her. I want to be her for Halloween. - That crunch is, like, outrageous. Who else can taste the crunch? - She said, "I just want you to witness the first bite," and then she put it in her mouth and looked at me and said, "Mmm," like that. - No! Helen is completely thirsty for Adrian. I can just imagine what fantasies she has about Adrian and food. - Adrian. - [laughs] - Mmm. - Thank you, everyone. - Thanks. - Nice seeing you for dinner. - Thank you. It was great. - Oh, yeah, that's nice. - Good night. - Okay, so... - All right. I'm gonna go to bed soon. - Okay, check yourself before you go to bed, please. - Rhy, can I ask you a favor? I put something in the washer, but I'm gonna go to bed, and I just need it in the dryer. - Here, put it in here, because I'm about to do some laundry. - Okay, let me-- - Yeah, and then... - Yes. - Okay. - Okay. - It's been half an hour. - What? - I'm trying to not get a crush. - On who? - Obviously. - Really? - Come talk to me. - Oh, this is--this is heavy sh--. - Yeah, so I think all of the guests have gone to bed now. - Yeah, I saw Craig go down. Yeah, earliest night ever. - I know. I love it. - Tell me what's up. What happened? - Oh, my God. She's-- - What happened? - Yo. So she comes down. She goes, "Laura, can I talk to you?" I was like, "Sure, yeah." Takes me down to the cabin. She's like, "Okay, I guess I'm gonna have to show you how to do a turndown," and I was just like, "Settle down." Like, "All you have to do is, "Oh, hey, you forgot a towel on the floor." Like, "Pick that up," or maybe even pick it up yourself, God forbid, and throw it in the laundry yourself. You are the fakest, most horrible woman I've ever met. Why can you not appreciate and have some respect for your stewardesses? And she just sat there like a ----ing idiot. - Well, all I can say to you is that you can be strong. You know, we have two weeks left in this charter, and she can run you ragged, and all you can do is rise above it. Everybody needs somebody they can confide in. You know, Kate can be bitchy, and for Laura to stand up to her, I'm actually kind of proud of her. You're strong, girl. You get it. - I don't think I've ever been this pissed off on charter. I don't love sass, and I don't love a stewardess who can't do her job. The combo is the worst. - You're good. - What? - Give me a hug. Looks like you need it. - I know. [alarm blaring] - This is gorgeous. Should be able to order this for another week. - Do you know where the bread plates are? Right. Excuse me. I just have something in my hands that is quite heavy. I don't know why you're doing it on purpose, but... - Can I get a cup of coffee, please? - Yeah, just cream, hey? - Yes, thank you. - Where were those? - We keep the bread plates above the bread knives, over in the same cupboard as the salt and pepper and everything we like-- - Oh, I'm too short to see under there. - They've been there the whole time. - Yeah. - Laura. Laura, Lee. - I need--I'll take over service. You can go talk to Captain Lee. - Soy. - Laura. Laura, Lee. - You can just go. I'll go. - Sure. Copy, I'll be right there. How are you? - I understand we had an issue last night. - Coming up... - So I'm a bit of a hectic chef. - I like that. - Obviously, she has a crush on me. Awkward. - I understand we had - I understand we had an issue last night. - Yeah. - Okay. Here's all I need. - Okay. - I need you to do your job. - Yep. - I don't need you to have a confrontation with our chief stew in front of guests. - Yeah. - I don't really care what prompted it. - Out of all of the times she's humiliated me in front of everyone, did it cross my mind to go to the captain and tattle on her? No. I honestly am not an angry person. Unfortunately, it came out in a less-than-eloquent way, but I agree with everything you're saying, and I will just do my job. - Nothing more, nothing less. - Smooth sailing ahead. - Great, thank you. - Thank you. - She let her mouth write a check that her ass couldn't cash. We've got two charters to go. She's gonna have to suck it up and do the right thing. [slurps] - Morning. - Hey, how are you? - Not very good, and now I'm having a bad hair day, which is in general just a bad day. - Copy. - And you guys are doing the slide? - Yeah. - Okay. It's frustrating as hell. I don't ever get to sit through the slide setup, and I'm never on anchor in the morning to really learn how that goes down. - Have you ever dropped an anchor before? - Not on a boat of this size. I'd like to learn. - Just shadow him. - I keep bringing it up, but I'm usually shut down. Doesn't ----ing matter what I say. I'm literally doing exactly what all of you guys want, which is put my head down and be a ----ing day worker. - Fix the attitude or ship out, bud. - Yes, sir. It's annoying. All right. I'm gonna go fix that up first 'cause they're laying out there. - Oh, thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Man, that looks like rain in the distance, hey? - How are you doing? - Good, and you? - Good. - Have you guys sorted your sh-- out again? - No. - No? - I've been taking so much sh--. - Mm-hmm. The only thing that people were, like, a bit taken back by was just the way you snapped. - Fair enough, fair enough. It's just crazy. - Look at how pretty. - I know. - We have some croissants. There's plain and chocolate. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Pardon me. I'm just gonna scoot this in here. - Mmm, that's delicious. - Very good. - It's the perfect omelet. - All I can tell from this group of guests is that at least two of them are in the Mafia. At least they're not too high maintenance. I bet Laura wouldn't tell Richard to check himself. That's what cement boots will scare people into, submission. So we're getting ready to pull the anchor and head to the next spot. We'll have all the water toys out. - Sounds like a plan. - Okay, Ash, pull 'em up. - Copy, Cap. - Morning. - Anchor's in the pocket. - Lock it in. We're out of here. - Can I wash these fenders up? Kind of grimy, a little bit. - If you want to just give it a quick wipe, yeah. Good job, Tyler. Tyler picks up on things really fast, and with Rhylee in such a great mood, it's a breath of fresh air. Whatever. - We have some guests. - Good morning. - Morning, how we doing? - Good. - Is this the cove we're gonna stay in for tonight? - Uh-huh. We're making our approach in. Deck crew, get ready for arrival. I'm gonna want four shots. - Four shots, copy that. - And drop. - We really appreciate you allowing us up here. - Yeah, it's not a problem. - Wow. - Hey, Tyler, get with Ashton. You guys start setting up the slide, man. Rhylee will do this. - Copy. - While we're doing this, do you want to set up that line? - I already did. - Oh, you did? - [sighs] - The guys are bro-ing up and thinking they need all this muscle man power, and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of being overlooked, and what point does it end? - Ready? - Okay. - We can readjust it once we inflate it a bit. - Okay. - Are you gonna be joining us for dinner tonight? - I'd be glad to. - There you go, go. - How are we doing? - Fabulous. - Would you like a glass of rosé? - Sure, I'll have a glass of rosé. - Yeah? Kate, Kate, Josiah. Can we have a glass of Whispering Angel, please? - Copy. - Okay. You know I have a store in Beverly Hills, so that would be fabulous. We were looking for one. Thank you. - All good? - I'm gonna need to use your laptop, and I'm just gonna give her a checklist, because she said when she arrived that she had so much experience, but, clearly, she doesn't know what she's doing. I don't care if she's lying or not, but what I do care about is the fact that the guests have no towels to wipe their body after a shower and no toilet paper to wipe their ass after they sh--. - Oh, my gosh. Do you see how far up it is? This is insane. I'm getting heart palpitations just looking. Doreen, are you gonna give it a whirl? - Oh, no, I'm afraid of heights. - Is Bruce going? - Oh, I don't think he'll go either. - I'm really big on active guests. On my old fire crew, my nickname was Throttle. I love the rush, but these guests, they are just super lame. - Darn, it's raining. - I'm gonna take a risk for lunch. - Oh, really? Lobster? - Duck confit. - I love duck confit. - And something else salad. Like, something fresh. - So just big plates? - Yeah, big white plates. - Yep. - You all right? - Just let me do it. I got it. - It's like she wants to prove something. - What? What? - Just stop trying to do too much on your own. If you need help, just come get me. - I don't. - If I'm here to help, just let me ----ing help. Just let me know when you need help, bloke. - I will. I will-- - You're trying to do too much on your own. - How? - You just are. I can see it. - Got it. - Rhylee, there's things why I do it, obviously, okay? - Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. - Are you sure? - Got it. I ----ing got it. I'll say it one more time before the fifth time, and I'll say it even more rude than the fourth time I just said it. - This is how you're talking to me? - Yeah. Ask me four more--ask me four times if I got it, and I say yes, and then ask me the fifth time, I'm gonna get attitude. - It's the way you--it's the way you're saying it. - Yeah. The fifth time, I'm gonna get attitude. I said I got it five ----ing times, so you want to handle this sh--? Then do it. - I said - I said I got it five ----ing times. I said five ----ing times I got it, and you want me to go somewhere else and you want to handle this sh--? Then do it. - No. You can do this, Rhylee. - Then let me ----ing do it. - I'm saying as when-- - I said I got it four ----ing times. - But the way you're saying it. I don't need attitude from you. - Because you asked me a fifth time. - Listen, dude. I'm gonna come back-- - Quit asking me. - What the hell is going on? She's been in such great spirits these past couple of charters and now this? I can't keep up. Here we ----ing go again. Listen here. You're so short. You have an attitude problem. - Yeah, I do have an attitude when I keep getting interrupted. Okay, tell me--tell me what you want to say. - Okay, great. Thank you. The fifth time you asked me the same question, I copped the attitude-- - It doesn't matter how much times I have to ask you, you're like, "Okay, got it." That's not a response. That's not how you should be replying. Just so I can--sorry. - Uh... - I'm doing what I'm supposed to doing. - Rhylee, give me attitude--listen, listen. - I'm giving you attitude 'cause you're interrupting me. - No, I'm not gonna listen, because you won't listen to me. - All right, Rhylee. This is how it's gonna be. When you want to listen to me, I'll listen to you. - Okay. If you're not gonna listen, look, I can find someone else that's gonna listen, all right? - Sounds great. Do that, Ross. - All right, then. All right, buddy. - (BLEEP) off, Ross. - You have a problem with me? Get rid of me. - All right. I'm just ----ing over it. I'm over it. Rhylee's had seven charters to learn her place and trust me, and I'm just done. I'm sick of it. She's got to go. ----ing hell. - Yeah, bloody hell is right. - Oh, for (BLEEP) sakes. - What happened? - So do I, man. - Just gonna eat more. I love to see people lose their sh--. It's, like, the best entertainment for me, as long as I'm not the one in the middle of it. - Hi. - Is there anything happening? - Nope, all the guests are sleeping. - Cool. - Oh, yeah, ----ing-- ----ing I forgot about that. I just got sidetracked. - That's okay. I did it. - I was gonna say, Rhylee, if she's not gonna reason or listen, then I'm gonna find someone else that will listen. Like, she's just giving me so much ----ing attitude. - What, now? - Just now. Like, she's screaming. She's just being so--actually, I'm just like--I just have to find someone that listens. - This is happening again? You know, one day she's happy, and then today she's miserable. It's so annoying. - I just don't need the ----ing attitude from her. Plain and simple. - It's called noise, bro. - Sweet. - Sweet. - Okay, watch your step. It's a little slippery. - Rhy, you okay? - Can I give you my blacks to wash? - Yeah, I can. What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm good right now. - Okay, you let me know. - Thanks. Thanks, Laura. - Laura, Laura. Can you please go around the cabins and make sure they've got full toilet paper and fresh towels, please? - No problem. - Did she copy? I don't know. - I didn't hear. - Laura, did you copy? - Sorry, yep, I copied. I answered you on my mic piece, but it wasn't plugged in. - Copy. - ----ing a dragon? - Kate, Kate, all of the guests at the table, and I've just given them all water. - Copy. - So good. - Okay, we're good? - Amen. - Ooh, that smells good. - Okay, so this is duck confit on some mirin-roasted red cabbage and kohlrabi salad, which I infused with sake. Enjoy. - Thank you. - Wow. - Yeah. - Oh, okay. - I'm cringing. I mean, it puts me in an awkward position. Obviously, she has a crush on me, and she's married to Tony Soprano, so, awkward. - I think this may end up being one of my favorite meals. The piece of basil, little bit of cabbage. It's so good. - Hey. - Helen's saying this is her favorite meal so far, so good job. - Bet she ----ing loves it. - Uh-huh, and she's been on many bodies of water. - I prefer she doesn't get onto my body. - Oh, she's already on it. - [laughs] - So it looks like there's a bit of wind outside. - Yeah. I mean, the weather's going south quickly, 24 knots. - Are we fine with the slide hanging off with this wind? - Yeah, we're gonna have to get that in. - Deck crew, deck crew. Can someone just quickly come to the bridge deck aft? The covers are flapping around a little bit. - Let's go get everything nailed down. Get the slide down, get everything buttoned back up there so we don't lose any covers. - Yep, copy. We'll start pulling these in. - We're starting to spin, like in that movie. - "The Perfect Storm." - Now you can't even see the mountains. - ----ing hell. - Do you still want me down here or what? - Yeah, you just stay on the controls. - Ride on, cowboy. Yeah, getting my freshwater shower. - Looks like the weather's picking up. - Could you feel it in your ballsack again? - Yeah, and my nipples started getting hard. - Ross' balls shrivel up when he feels rain coming. [laughter] - Cleaned those plates. Do we have to dance still? I'm not in the mood. - Better start getting your Tahitian dance routine on. - Are you ----ing kidding me? - Where would you like me? - Yeah, you can go. Yeah, we don't need you. - I'm ----ing over it. I literally feel like Tyler, who has no experience on yachts, is now above me. I just don't respect any of these guys because they're not treating me with any kind of respect that I deserve. - Coming up... - Are you excited for tonight? - Usually when we go out, Ash is going after all the girls. - Ew. I'm definitely not a girl that just hooks up with random guys. Stop putting sh-- in my head, Adrian. You're just miserable. - Yeah, oh, and, by the way, - Yeah, oh, and, by the way, dinner's at 7:30. - Perfect. Do you think we can have a night without drama? - I know I can. - She's quite a dramatic person. - Sometimes it's better just to let the captain handle it, 'cause you're big and bad when you're yelling at me, but to the captain, you're not saying the same things, are you? - What's up? - Changing. - Nap and a shower for me. - We need to fit you for your Tahitian costume. - I thought we were gonna pick on the new guy. - Come on. They requested dancing entertainment, and you're like, "Not me." - The guests have all requested a Polynesian-inspired dinner party with the yacht crew performing Tahitian-style entertainment. - We'll throw some lima beans in a water bottle. That's a maraca. We'll put Ashton in some palm fronds 'cause he's got a good body, and we'll hope for the best. Laura, are you still up for dancing? - [groans] - Yep. That's a yes. - Yeah, she's in. - All righty. Okay, Adrian. I have to have heels on in the kitchen. [laughter] - So you've been enjoying your trip so far? - Well, you guys have made it amazing. - Great. - Yes. - Okay, I'm a bit of a hectic chef. - I like that. So what are you doing here? - This is a truffled cream of celery. - Okay. - I creamed it a bit and just truffled it. - Have you got a new sous chef, Adrian? - Yeah. - Well, he needs to give me a job. I'm waiting for a job. - Helen reminds me of one of my first girlfriends: Peruvian, big-breasted, very extravagant, but her husband, I'm a little bit worried that he's gonna put me in a body of water. - Dinner is how I unwind. You know, the anticipation of what's to come later on can be as amazing as the experience. - Oh, for sure, yeah. - [laughs] - The clouds come over. Yes, and the rain comes down. - We want to kind of script a story about the guest's time on the boats, and we want to bring some humor into it. The guests all scatter, and the slide is no more. [laughter] We're trying to get creative. We're trying to do some cool movements. It's gonna be fun. - Around. - Yes, I love it. - How's your day going, Rhylee? - That's a loaded question, Kate. - What's the matter? - Ross is, like, telling me I have an attitude, and, like, basically threatening to get rid of me. - You know you're not going anywhere. Do you want advice from me? - Sure. - You're really good at your job, but you're in a very fortunate situation, which is no responsibility. You could right now just be, like, worry-free. - I should just let them do all the heavy sh--. - Yeah. Let them worry. Let them stress. I don't think Ross is serious about getting rid of Rhylee. I think he's just at his wit's end, but at least Rhylee uses sentences that are about work instead of just saying, "Check yourself. Check yourself. Check yourself." Just be honest and be like, "I want to finish the season. I'm sorry for any misunderstandings." Just be the better person. Don't get sassy. - [laughs] - Okay? - Okay. Ross, Ross, can you meet me in the beach club? - Yeah, copy, on my way. - Oh, I love it. - Perfect. - What's up? - Ross, you know that I enjoy working with you, but sometimes I feel like I miss out on the big things. I want to feel more respected. I'm not called upon to do a lot of things. Tyler's been called upon to do slide sh--. I've got to feel like I'm doing more than, like, the ----ing new guy coming on. - What you're doing is ----ing very important to me. I leave you on the swim platform. That's more important than doing a ----ing slide. I can't trust Tyler being on the swim platform because he's new. You are very valuable. What I don't like is this backchat that I get. I don't want to let you go. I love working with you. You're talking about, "Oh, you don't give me important sh--. You don't give me this and that." - That's how I start to feel when I'm sitting up here ----ing cleaning, okay? It's menial. It feels like I'm ----ing underneath every ----ing person, and that's why I'm like, "I don't give a (BLEEP) if you want to let me go." - If she would just stop questioning everything I ask her to do, she would realize everything I put on her is important. It's just so frustrating to me that she can't see that. I'm gonna let this whole conversation go, okay? I don't--look, the last thing I want is for me to have to make ----ing changes. I don't want you to go. I like ----ing having you here, but this is--like, Rhylee, you can argue with me all ----ing day, or you can just agree with me and say, "Okay, I ----ing got it." All right. - We ready? - Yep. - Thank you for joining us. We're so excited. - My pleasure, thanks for having me, thank you. - So glad to have you. - I made a bunch of checklists for Laura. She's going to checklist herself. - Ladies. - Thank you. - Okay, that's good. - So what's going on? - I'm going with my list. - Checklist yourself. - That was good. That was good. - In every--in every room. - Yes, give me the checklist. Let me know how you do things. I will admit that I've been messing up on my turndowns, however, it's really hard to stay motivated when you're being treated in such a way. - We're ready when you are. The guests have just moved to the table. - Cool. - God, you hear that reef out there? - Yes. - So, Rhylee, do you want to-- - I'm good. - Lunch makes them sleepy. - I know I have a temper. It's something that I got from my father. I don't know how to fix it, and it's hard for me to admit that, but, obviously, I'm the issue. - Coming up... - Walk up the stairs and do your thing. - Hey, are we chanting? - Tonight is probably the most important night of my life. - We have some local performers. - Oh, my God. I'm loving this. - Once the sauce is on, - Once the sauce is on, we're good to go. - Thanks, Chef. - Okay. - Adrian has prepared seared tuna, truffled celery cream, and snow peas. - This is like eating a painting. - Mmm. - This guy's got mad skills. - Look how small I am compared to you. - You look good. - (BLEEP), these things are quite pokey. - Is that too tight? - Tonight is probably the most important night of my life. I'm going to be a Tahitian god in front of strangers on a yacht. I'm stoked. [laughs] - How are cabins? - Good. - Good? Okay. - Well, I don't look Tahitian compared to you guys at all. - That just look all right? - All right, that looks good. - Wish I was dancing now. - Look at us. We look brilliant. - Hm. Okay. Yes, Laura has done a great job now that I have given her a checklist. Good job. You did your job. - I'm so excited. - When I say "Ia ora na," that means walk up the stairs and do your thing. - Hey, are we chanting? Just feel the vibe. - That was so yummy. - I actually sliced the cauliflower. - Ia ora na. If you guys don't mind, we have some local performers, just to finish off your evening. - Oh, my God. - I love it. [laughter] - So this is one of the sacred Tahitian storybooks that's been passed on through generations and generations of our tribe. The sun comes up and shares its warm rays. - I'm loving this. - The guests enjoy Jet Skiing 'round and 'round the boat, but the clouds come over and the rain comes down. The guests all scatter, and the slide is no more. [laughter] But the guests are in luck, because Adrian serves them duck. The end. - Bravo. - Bravo. - Thank you, guys. Thank you. - You have quite the crew, I have to say, Captain Lee. - Ashton, you nailed it. - Did I? - I have goosebumps. - Yes! - I will bid you all good night. - Thank you. - No, thank you. - Yeah, I'm getting ----ing beat. - Good night. - Meet you in the bow. - Yeah. - Don't put your feet near there. - Is it dirty? - It's not dirty, but-- - Oily. - It's just--that's an anchor. If something breaks or something, your foot goes in there with it. - Right. I love having Ashton around, considering everything I'm going through with Kate and Josiah. He has a really good heart. I don't really know him too well yet, but what I do know, I really like, and he's adorable. - Let's go. [alarm blaring] - Let's get ready for departure. - Ready, bow and anchor, Cap. - Let's pull it up. - Copy that. - Hi. Good morning. How are you? - Good. - Oh, here. Scoot you over. - Hug it out? - What did you say? - Hug it out? - Come here. You all right? Feeling better today? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. I do have a soft spot for Rhylee, 'cause I know she means well. I'm done with the attitude, but we've been through a lot this season, and I'm just hoping that I got through to her so that we can end the season on a good note. - Tow line all the way out. - We're out of here. - Don't drop it. - This is ham, cheese, and mushroom crepe, and then there's Nutella and banana crepes down there. - So I have to learn how to make these? - Very good. - Wow. - Yeah. - What are you doing up here? - Watching that weather. - We need to get on land and, like, explore. - I know. - I think it'd be cool to see what the jungles are like. Yeah, I've got feelings for Tyler. - There's got to be some epic sh-- up there. - I feel like I've been able to be myself more with Tyler than I have with anybody on the boat. Maybe that's because we had sex right away, and, damn it, Rhylee, learn your lesson. - I'm gonna try to get on a boat here. - There's a lot of fishing boats too. - Eh. - I need radio silence till we get to the dock. And drop. - Both lines off. Pull 'em tight. Secure. - Copy that. I need all crew on the aft deck in your whites ASAP. - Okay, copy that. - Oh, this is so sad. Parting is such sweet sorrow. - Bye. - Adrian. - My tan now. - Absolutely. - Adrian. - Bye. - I'm gonna miss you. It was a pleasure meeting you, and thank you. - It's nice to have a very interesting group. Let's call it that. - I want to hand that over to you. You guys were fabulous, each and every one of you. Thank you very much. - Adrian. [laughter] - Let's go to work. - All right, I'm gonna do the beach club. - I'll rinse down here. You start the bow. - Attention all crew, attention all crew. I need everybody in the crew mess in five. The little skit you guys did last night I thought was hilarious. I am a little bit concerned that we may be starting to lose focus. This is not a democracy. You don't get a ----ing vote, period. I'm asking you to love everybody that you work with. You don't have to, but if everybody's doing their job, then nobody should have any complaints. So there's no reason that we can't pull together and end this on a really strong finish. 20 grand. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - You as well. - Thank you. - Thank you. Kate. - Thank you. - Welcome. - Well, thanks, guys. - What are you wearing tonight? - [whispers] The lights off. - You look cute. Are you wearing that? - Yeah. - I did my hair, and I had to glue down. - Shoes. Shirt. Pants. - I wonder how crazy it's gonna get. - You know what? I'm not wearing ripped pants tonight. That's weird. - What time is it now? - I don't know. - Ah, sh--. - What did you do? - This is way better. - I literally just slept, guys. - Walk of shame. Walk of shame. - We're never leaving on time. - Hey, boo boo. - Hi. Are you excited for tonight? Anybody starts talking to a girl, within two minutes, he's there grinding up on her. - Ew. I'm just a number? I'm a little unsettled by Adrian's comment. I'm definitely not a girl that just hooks up with random guys, and I'm definitely not a girl that's just another notch on a guy's belt. I'm not into it. Stop putting sh-- in my head, Adrian. - What? - You're just miserable. - Coming up... - I've got to sit on my rocking chair when I'm 75 with some ----ing stories. - All right, let's go. - All right, let's go. - Ooh. It's chilly tonight, huh? - Here, let's go. I got you. - Oh, it's so-- - [snores] No! Wake up! Just-- all you gotta do is ask. - Nobody wants to hear that the guy they're talking to is this massive player, but I'm hoping that he proves me wrong. - At the same time. - [laughs] - I saw a nipple. - No, you didn't. - I'm having a sex-istential crisis. I can go six weeks. - We can get out. Let's go. - Our favorite place. - I know! Let's go to the bar. - Why? - Hey. - Cheers! Cheers! - Let's go! - Oh! - I'm a bit confused. We've been on this good vibe, but now she's being all cold towards me. It's definitely not gonna stop me from having a good time. I'm gonna wingman you, and we're gonna scope some ladies. - I have one speed when I go out, and it's, like, 200%. I'm young. I've got to sit on my rocking chair when I'm 75 with some ----ing stories. - [screams] We're not in a relationship, so, of course, like, I can't hold him to any standard. I don't think he thinks about intentions. I think he's thinking with his dick. Have a ball of a time. Have all the fun you want, but don't hold my hand an hour or two prior and then go start dancing with all of these other girls. It's just rude. - Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. - I have to pee. - Get in the van. - [laughs] - Ash and Tyler, I noticed you guys did not hold back going after that local Tahitian-- - No, I set Tyler up with a local. - I'm gonna chalk it up to drunken brotherhood. Oh, I got to pee. Oh, don't push on me. - Don't be a (BLEEP). - Thank you. Are you gonna carry me? - Oh, my goodness. Everyone come home. Come on. - Uh-oh. - Rossy. Ugh. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. What the hell do you want to talk about? You drunken ----ing fool. - It's not like I forgive him. It's just, I'm in the mood for sex right now, so this time, Tyler gets a pass. - No, no. - Really? - Really what? Like, what's-- what's upset you? - Nothing's upset me, but I don't, like... Nothing's upset me. Am I pissed off? Yeah. Obviously, I care. I thought you respected me. I thought that we established a connection. - Ashton, I didn't see you all night. As soon as we got to the club, you were dancing with other girls all night. And that's fine, babe, but, like, I'm not gonna be a tally on your checklist. - So that's all good, but you've laid your bed, and you've made your bed, so you're gonna go sleep in it. - Before we went out, Adrian started telling me, "Oh, yeah, Ashton's hooked up with, like, "a couple girls before you arrived, da, da, da, da, da." Did I hook up with anybody? If you saw the way that I was-- - If you're not gonna listen to what I'm saying, then I'm just gonna walk away, because I'm just, like-- - Okay, okay. You know what? Let's end it. That's cool. - Yeah, yeah. This is stupid. This is stupid, 'cause you're not even listening, and you're ----ing wasted, and this is just a stupid conversation. - Next on "Below Deck"... - Charley Walters. Group has requested an all-gold party. - Holy sh--, is that real? Damn. - You're making me embarrassed. - Can I get a sparkling water please? - Can we get six tequila shots? - Kate, when's the main course being served? - Kate, serve them real food. - They're being extra extra. - Oh, God. Man down off the Jet Ski. - Oh, sh--. - Ross, can you see Billy in the water? - What the (BLEEP) is going on? Cut the lines loose.
