Are we going to wash it? - Uh, let's go ahead, and I'll wash it down in check the space. - Okay. - I love being the boss.

You, you, you. - Oh, God. - I would really like to tell Laura that she clearly is full of sh-- and that she doesn't know as much as she thinks she does, but I don't have time to like her or dislike her. I've got a lot to do. At least we have us, you know? - Yeah. - The normal ones. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Cheers, bro. - Cheers. - I don't think I've had a proper chat to you. Like, you know, there was a quite a special moment when I got back onto the boat and you gave me a hug. It was like safety, you know? Like, when you were holding me, I felt safe, Roo. [tense music] Um-- - And I think, you know, it's obvious, that you mean-- that I care about you. And that we've become close, but it was just-- I just needed to--I don't know.

I'm in an open relationship with my girlfriend, so it's fun to have somebody to flirt with. - Maybe I should stick to the water like a good girl. - Yeah, that's advisable. - [laughs] - And she apparently enjoys it, so we'll see where it goes. - Thank you. - No, you look great. - Oh? [laughter] - Do you know what I want? Chicken. - Oh, I'd love some chicken right now. - I would love-- - Ooh, I'm getting a Greek salad. The bro drinks are always the best drinks. You know why, Rhy?

It was gnarly. Like, ten of us went over a cliff. None of us died. - Holy sh--. - It just ruined my athletic career. - Wow. - Oh, my gosh. - I didn't break any bones, but I had to go to the hospital and the whole deal. I got road rash everywhere on my body, and I couldn't do sports, because I was on crutches and I was picking rocks out of my skin. - So did you have to, like, shift gears, decide what to do with your life all of a sudden? - Yep. I started forest firefighting. - In the Woodland? - In the Woodlands, yes. I think the accident really opened my eyes about playing it safe, and I decided that I was going to live every day like it would be my last. And then I got into yachting when I moved to southern California to surf and be a beach bum. - Right here, thank you. - Merci. - Thank you. - Enjoy your meal. [upbeat music] - Yes. Home sweet home, right here. - Do we really want to go out? We have a big day tomorrow flipping the boat. - What's wrong? - Nothing is wrong. I'm offering suggestions.

I just--I just work here. - That's right, I did just work charters, but I was working pretty hard before I got here. - I honestly think it was impossible that you were working the same situation. - I didn't say I was, hey. - Right. So why even bring it up? I don't know. - It's pretty uncalled for that Kate disrespected me in front of the entire crew. It's not a good feeling. - I'm asking you guys. - You want a ciggy? - Yeah. - Let's have a ciggy, bro. - I want to say Laura, but like, I'm not going to, like, force it. We connect and we chat on different levels, which, like, is a lot more intense than just hooking up. Does that make sense? - Yeah, absolutely. - Oh, thanks so much. - How was your dinner? - Oh, it was good. And yours? - Nothing. - What's on your mind? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. See you.

Let's not talk, let's not talk. - Somebody's doing him a favor. - I'm out. - And that's not making me a fool? The fact that he's painting me in this negative light, it's belittling to me. I'm going to the boat. That's bullsh--. [groans] - Let's go back, guys. - This is the least wild yacht crew I've ever worked with. - But you haven't caught us at the club. - Not one man is left behind. - These are our people. - [grunts] - What, no, but where's-- where's ----ing Rhylee, though? - She walked back to the boat. - Sweet Tyler-- - Rhylee's in your room. She's waiting for you. - Ah, (BLEEP). - [exhales] - "My Seanna," I missed you so much. - Aw, thanks, Ty. - Are we going to go-- [grunts] [upbeat music] - Rhy? - Where is everybody? - Uh, up top. - Is that a dildo? - Maybe. - I've never used a dildo. I think those are weird. I think Tyler retreated back to see Rhylee. - Top of this.

[tense music] You have no problem saying your opinions about me in front of the entire crew so... - Kate, like, this is not fair. - Can I go to bed? - Let's--can we go chill on the sun deck? - Yeah, yeah. - Let's go, come. - Please, I need some air. - Bring your water. - What is wrong with people? ♪ ♪ - Honey, I'm home. Did I not handle that so well? - No, you were everything. [knocking] - Who's knocking on our door? - Oh, I was just coming up here to have a drink with you guys. - It's ----ed up that I'm being attacked for no reason. I ----ing hustled all charter hard. Um, so why do I deserve you attacking me? You--I don't deserve that. - After what Caroline... - I know. - Spewed to the crew, I'm very sensitive to people thinking that just because we work well together, it's an alliance. It's not. I want to be inclusive. However, I think other things that she says are bullsh--. - She's threatened because I came in. She's like, "Oh, you tell me you were chief stew." - She was never chief stew of a boat this size. Not possible. - Yeah, I was. And, like, to be honest, no. Your vessel, like, no. It's not up to standard in yachting. - She also dropped seven champagne glasses right before guest arrival. You know what, accidents happen. But you know what is not an accident? All the negative comments she's said since she's arrived. - There's ----ing sh-- everywhere. Like, sorry to say to you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I don't trust her. - All right, guys. I think Kate's being a little rude to Laura. Am I surprised? (BLEEP) no. - What Kate did tonight was not about you. It was about Kate. Kate took you on out of insecurity tonight. She felt threatened. You are completely right to be upset, but I'm going to be that guy that's going to stand there and say, "Hey, you are stronger than that, and you--you are better than that." Let it go. - You know what, you are-- wow, yeah, you're right. [gasps] What would I do without you? [laughter] I thought that Ashton was a typical South African bro jock and a bit of a player. I didn't really realize, like, he has wisdom. He has depth. He's making me feel like I'm speaking to a friend from home. I feel what your tough love is doing. This is so refreshing and so nice. - Good, I'm glad. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Good night. - Are we going to go up to the crow's nest? - Yeah. [tense music] ♪ ♪ - I am so sorry.

How's it going in here? - I'm not sure how to read Laura. I mean, we hold hands, hug. It usually means that somebody's interested, or they're trying to get the attention of somebody else. She could be using me as a game to get to Ashton. Who knows? - I'm going to shower. Do you need the washroom? - Hey, there he is. - Hey. What's up, bro? - It's, uh-- - You are a good cuddle buddy. - Am I? Yeah, I practiced it. - I feel good, I feel happy. Smiley Rhylee's around this morning for sure.

You have to flip all the rooms. Laura, can you start folding in laundry, please? - Copy. - Laura has been slowly getting on my nerves since the day she arrived, so I'm not really that sorry that I got frustrated.

You know when you're sleeping and a mosquito is buzzing around you and you can't seem to find it? That's how I feel about Kate's negativity. It's, like, there, but I can't, like, kill it. She needs to learn that you cannot treat people this way. [sighs] - Kate, Adrian, Ross. Can I get you guys up to the wheelhouse, please? - What's up, sports fans? - All right, charter number seven. - Jeez. - We have co-primaries all the way across the board. The guests are arriving today on Air Tahiti Nui. - All right. - Helen and her fiancé, Richard. - I think that Richard might be at the top of the Mafia hierarchy. - Bruce and Doreen, who are longtime mega yacht owners. Dr. Craig, Linda, Kathy, and Jamie complete this group of adventurous entrepreneurs. Three sets of friends all joining in as co-primaries and travelling together for the first time. That ought to be interesting. - Usually, you prioritize the main guests. Right now, everybody's the main guest, so it's going to be really interesting. - The guests have all requested a Polynesian-inspired dinner party with the yacht crew performing Tahitian-style entertainment. - Can't be pouring wine if I'm dancing in a hula skirt. - Right.

Just do the turndowns. - Okay, bye. - What the hell - What the hell happened last night? - From where? - In the ----ing sky lounge. - I just overheard you saying to Ashton, "See, I told you they don't like me." So you were talking about me and Kate, so I went down and said, "Laura just came out and said she doesn't like us." But it was probably all my fault. - I think it was misinterpreted. - I wasn't really keen on Laura when she came in, but, absolutely, I've changed my opinion of people, and Laura seems like a lovely girl. I'm just hoping that we can squash this issue because I do not want another Caroline situation. - I just really don't want chatter, like, behind our backs and sh--.

When I'm on charter, I don't often speak to my girlfriend, but with everything that's happened with Laura, it's really nice to have her and be able to reach out to her. Being in this relationship versus past open and long-distance relationships, she doesn't expect anything from me. When she hears from me, she's happy. When she feels like messaging me, she does. Of course, that physical contact. Those cuddles, those sweet attentions. I miss it. I miss every part of it. - All crew, all crew, can you give me a hand with the provisions on the dock, please?

Have fun, you guys. - Thank you. - I have--I have staged the remote right here. - Perfect. Okay, look, now, while that's here and I'm here, you can go get that compressor hose ready to go. Just turn that thing off, you know? - I wouldn't say it's important for me to keep work and play separate, but I'm really good at it. When I think about work, I just do my job. When we're not working, I think about having sex with Rhylee. - Good, you got it out. That's awesome. - I did, thanks. - It's time to play. [both gasp] [both laugh] - I mean, black is chic, but it's also, like, 106 degrees in Tahiti. But it hides the bloodstains. So weird. - Are you getting the yacht in the background too? You are? - Yeah, that's awesome. - Look at that, you know those people are not on their cell phone. I'm very fascinated by this. - How's your rosé? Would you like a top-up? Do you want a Dr. Pepper? Would you like Red Bull and soda? Would you like some snacks? - Did you see the waterfall? - Oh, wow. If this is a punishment from Kate, I'll take it. This is amazing. Fresh air, beautiful Tahitian islands, and Ashton. No problem. - Do you know any history of the Tahitian islands? - I was hoping you weren't going to ask that because I'm probably the worst tour guide for this trip ever. [upbeat music] - Motor yacht "My Seanna," we will be at the boat in a few minutes. - Copy.

Oh, and Adrian, by the way, I just confirmed with Helen and Richard that dinner for 8:30. - Perfect, thank you. - See you guys in a bit. - Okay. - I keep getting confused what floor I'm on.

I've never seen her so happy so... - Good, let's keep it through until the end of the charter. - Yeah. - What's your favorite nut? - Uh, cashews. - Really? - And pistachios. - Those are my least favorite. - What are your favorite? - Pecans and macadamias. - Really? [both laugh] - I'm playing it easy with Laura. I'm enjoying getting to know her. I think the seeds have all been planted, and I think the garden's growing at the moment. Out of all the things you could talk about! Your favorite nuts. - Coming up... - You need to seriously figure your sh-- out. This is enough. You need to check yourself! You need to check yourself!

What's going on with Laura? - She's a sweet girl. Yeah, I can't act like a hooligan and bounce around between girls and stuff. I have a lot of respect for her. Like, I won't do that. - So you're going to stay with her? - I need to figure out what the vibe is, because I think there's a lot more to her than what she's letting everybody in on. - I'm still trying to figure her out. Laura didn't seem into him at the beginning. I think Ashton took it as a challenge, and he's trying to get one more point for the scoreboard. I feel bad for Laura. She doesn't know what's coming for her. Wow, that's going to be interesting seeing you at the club just, like, biting your hand. - [laughs] [groovy music] ♪ ♪ - Are you guys ready to have dinner? I'll let Adrian know. - Yes, okay, fantastic. Thank you. - Adrian, Adrian. The guests are seated at the table. - Copy that. - Absolutely gorgeous.

I love crab. - So good. - My palate is very happy right now. This chef is top-notch. - I'm going to go check the turndowns. [tense music] What the (BLEEP)? [exhales] Ugh, idiot. Oh, nope. Is this bitch for real? Here we go again. Laura, Laura, can you please come to the master? - Copy that. Hi, what's up? - I think you might be a little confused about what "turndowns" means. - Here we go. - I thought because you had so much experience that I didn't have to explain it. Come on. [intense music] Okay, so what's the deal with the bathroom? - What's the deal with the bathroom? This wasn't like this when I came in. - But the master's also like that. - Okay, they might have gone up, but this towel was not on this door when I came in. - Okay, and then this one was like that, and then, that one was like that. - I don't understand why you're just being so aggressive. - I'm not being aggressive. - But you are, though, Kate. I don't understand why. Like, you are. You don't see-- - I'm in a rush because I'm serving dinner. - I understand. Okay, that's cool. - Okay. I'll try a different way. - You just have to relax, man. - Please, Laura. - Like, I don't understand why. - I'm not relaxed because you're not doing the job that you said you could do. - Okay. - So I'm not relaxed. - You need to settle down. - I will settle down-- - Say, "Laura, do the towels."

The difference between my chief stewing style and Kate's is that I would never make my stewardess feel like sh--. I have lived and worked all over the world and I've never experienced this before. It's unprofessional. - I am actually going to freak out. - She didn't like that I asked her to redo the turndowns. I would like to know how she, as a chief stew of a boat this size, would have asked her stewardess to do it again. - Yeah, she said she was very brutal as a chief stew. - Oh, was she? Did they do turndowns on that boat? - [laughs] - I feel like I am in "the Twilight Zone" right now. You have no problem criticizing how I do my job and you cannot even do yours. So sorry, that's not okay. Laura, Laura, can you come to the galley for service? Pretty please. - Okay, okay, okay. - This is one of my top five dream meals. Seafood pasta. - Let's roll. [upbeat music] - That's incredible.
