[engine revving] - Put the ski away. Chandler, I want somebody to keep eyes on him. - Okay. - It's very difficult just to tell a chartered guest no, they can't do something. But when the chartered guest is your friend, it just compounds everything. As soon as the ski comes in, pull the plug on it. Then it doesn't go out again. My job is to keep him safe, whether he likes it or not. I'm really pissed off at the deck crew. I mean, they know better. Why would you let him go out?

[both laughing] - Ashton, are you gonna go over? - Uh, three--yeah, three people are gonna go over. - Okay, what would you have me on? - Someone needs to stay on here just in case the anchor comes loose. I've done hundreds of beach setups, but Tahiti's different. There's a deep shelf. Right off the beach there's rocks. I really don't have time to walk Rhlyee through the setup. We're getting out of here. - Do you need hands? - I would like you to be there, yeah. - Cool. - Are you guys leaving now? - I'm standing by. - Give me a push. Yeah, thank you. - Just radio me when I need to be ready. I work on boats. I'm a captain. I work every summer on a boat in Alaska.

It's--it's just too rough. The anchor could drag. The boat could end up on the beach. There's no way that we're getting guests out of the boat safely, and after this morning safety is the number one concern. And then the guests' happiness. - All right, come back this way. Let's scratch the beach party. We'll do it back here. - Mm, okay. I'll tell Mr. Bradley first. - [sighs] [upbeat music] - Mm. - Hi! - Hey! Just the person I was looking for. I want the captain tonight to wear the dark one. Tonight's gonna be a formal night. ♪ ♪ - Uh, so, change of plans. If you look at that beach, it is quite steep.

I've only ever been in any real relationship with one man, and that was my ex-fiancé. We met in Florida, fell in love, and got engaged. And so my time was spent going to Alaska, and then headed back to Florida. I don't regret this tattoo. I actually like how it looks, too. I was experiencing all these new things and he wasn't experiencing them with me, and it led to hard times. It's a lot of hurt that I went through. I'm definitely getting a tattoo while we're in Tahiti. - Sure. both: Hey. - Are you gonna go now? - Yeah, yeah. Take a break. - You going to the bow? - Yeah, let's go. - I've not been out to the bow yet. - Oh, my God. Welcome to the bow. I think Josiah is the toughest nut to crack on the crew. This frustrates me because of my desire to understand people. Did you see the kid I matched with on Tinder next--next to... - You matched with someone on Tinder? - Yeah, on this boat right here. - I'm gonna give you three options: You should either go out on a date with Ashton, Chandler, or the guy that you matched with on Tinder. - [laughing] Hold a gun to my head. - Uh... - Chandler. - [stammers] Oh, my God. You should go on a date with Chandler. - Flip. - Oh. - Do you like boys or girls? Or both? - I like guys. I hate talking about this stuff so much. Like, where I live, it's a very old-school village. When I say that I'm into whatever, they say, "Oh, well, you don't look like you are." - What does a gay person look like? - I was like, "Okay." - That's a pretty stupid thing to say. - But a lot of people think-- when they first start to discover that-- they should start looking a certain way because people say, "Oh, you don't look it." It's very different for each and every person. My family's very loving and kind so I was never scared, but regardless I'd never felt the need to come out to people. I don't think people should come out. You should just live your best life being who you are. - Don't you just want to jump off this boat and go swimming? - No. [peppy music] ♪ ♪ - Matt, you look good, bro, eh? - Thanks, man. - No, you should stay home, bro.

You're gonna piss everybody off at 6:00 AM. - I did tell her earlier in the night that when we're off the boat I'm not your boss, but that still doesn't mean you can treat someone like a complete savage. - Everybody's gonna be mad, everybody's gonna be tired... - I just want you to stop talking right now, please. - As my boss or a person? - As a boss and as a person. - I should have just stayed on the ----ing boat tonight, 'cause it's gonna add so much more time.

[dramatic music] - Next, on "Below Deck"... - You don't have to like me, but you will respect me. - [hyperventilating] - What the hell? - Caroline? - Primaries: Allen and Danielle. The last couple of times, they haven't had a great time. We need to nail this. We're coming into a little squall area, here.

You're a junior deckhand. Just shut up. - I'm also a boat captain. - All right, let's talk about this later. - Yes, sir. - This behavior can't be tolerated.
