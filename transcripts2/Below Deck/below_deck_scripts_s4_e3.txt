 - Previously on "Below Deck"... - Kate, Trevor,  senior deckhand. Trevor,  I'm senior deckhand. - Good to meet you, man.  - Senior deckhand. - "Hey, I'm Trevor,  I'm senior deckhand." - The other two deckhands are having a little issue with Trevor. - He's your responsibility. If he becomes mine,  then you dropped the ball. - Nico, girlfriend back home? - I'm kind of with someone,

 but we just recently started talking. - Okay, so it's just fresh.  - Yeah. - So you're talking to someone,  but not dating. - Yeah. - Should we soak our feet? - There's no question like, is this flirting,  is it not flirting? It's so clear, finally. - It's your job to do the toast. - Then just ask me  to do the toast. You don't really need to have a temper tantrum like a 3-year-old over a toaster. - Why don't you keep  your opinion to yourself? - You don't respect anybody.

 Go to bed, go. - Just go to bed. - Nico, I'd prefer if you  slept in the guest room. - This is f---ing bullsh--. ¶ ¶ - Nothing, I'm staying  in the guest room. This guy's being an asshole. They had to separate us. And I was like,  I don't want any trouble. I told you,  like, since day one, I was gonna have problems  with him. I'm not gonna stay here  if he's here. I just started reconnecting with this girl that I know  since I was 16 years old. And she's really supportive  of my job. She obviously knows, like, it's  something that I've been doing and that I'm passionate about. - No, not at all. Right now, talking with her,  I feel relieved, and I feel like, you know,  she understands me. I'm not gonna work with this guy  that, on the free time, is taking personal jabs at me. - I've got to figure out  a way to reach Trevor. And I'm not sure how I'm gonna  communicate it to him yet, because I have to keep him  motivated on deck. Losing a man on the first  charter is not acceptable. - Are you hungry, Ems? - I found some breakfast,  but I'll be hungry in a bit. - Do you like smoked salmon?  - Love it. - Did you have fun last night?  - Yeah. - Just some people, I think, just had a little bit too much to drink last night. - What? What did I miss? - Just a little situation, but it's not a big deal. This is a team effort, and if one of the teammates  is being "that guy," then it interferes  with your work. Yeah. - Last night,  I was a little bit juiced up. We all were. And I just happened  to make a comment that was completely harmless, and now there's drama,  and I'm involved in it. And it's like,  I'm the last person to f---ing get involved  in drama. - Have you guys done any Asia traveling? - I've never been to Asia.  I'd love to go. - Thailand's amazing. One meal cost me like 10 bucks. I was like,  well, this is amazing. - Good morning. - Trevor f---ed up. He got wasted, ran his mouth. When you start crossing  personal boundaries, even on your off-time,  that's not gonna fly. ¶ ¶ - Hi, how's it going? - Did you do the twin yet?  - Yeah, the twin's done. - Someone slept in it? - Yeah, Nico slept in it last night. Trevor got a little bit...  wordy in the Jacuzzi. - Oh. Trevor's sweet, but his energy  is slightly unsettled. He's a bit like a cat  on a hot tin roof. - Ow. Awesome day,  awesome f---ing day. - I thought he seemed  a bit off this morning. - Yeah, he's probably  embarrassed. ¶ ¶ - How was sleeping  in the guest quarters, huh? - I was popping champagne  bottles with my feet up. - Where was my invite? - You knew where I was. - Nico and I, I feel like  we're on the same page. We have exactly the same,  you know, personality type. Someone that has  that same mind-set is already a breath  of fresh air. It's like, all right, thank God. Were you hungover? - I wasn't hungover,  but I was just like, how did that even,  like, come about? We're all having fun  in the Jacuzzi, and the first thing he said was like, "Oh, yeah, your tattoos are so faded," this and that. And I was just like, "Why are you saying anything? "I don't care about your opinion. It's my body." - Yeah, it's like  a personal insult that's got nothing  to do with anything. - I don't want  to stir any sh-- up, especially with someone I work with. - I feel like you're  the same as me. Like, nothing  really rattles you. You know, it sort of bounces  off you, but if you snap,  you f---ing snap. - Yeah.  - You know? - Absolutely. ¶ ¶ - Oh, my God, Kate.  - Yeah? - I just opened it.  - Oh, my God. - Sierra left it in.  - Oh, God. - This is still wet,  and this is hot. I've never had  a burnt sheet before. I did stress the importance of always  turning an iron off. Just so you know,  the roller iron was still on. Just turn it off. It's like when you go  to your grandparents' house, and on the back of the door,  they have, in needlepoint, "Did you turn off the oven?" We need one of those for Sierra. We're not gonna get mad at her, but we just need this  to not happen again. ¶ ¶ - Kate, Ben, Kelley,  I need you guys down in the crew mess  for prepping sheet meeting. - Hi.  - Hey. - So charter number two. We have some yachties. Two of them own yachts. We have Dave and Jodi Mailer, Robert Gelmeyer and Douglas Wolff, who are a couple, and then we have Scupper. Appears to be a French poodle. Ground red meat and lamb. - Is that what they're into?  - That's what the dog is into. - Fluffy little f---er. I'm not absolutely thrilled about having to cook for a dog. I grew up with dogs, and they were pretty okay  just eating out of a can. - If their dog's name  is Scupper, they're real yachties. - Yeah. Jodi doesn't eat  red meat or pork. They want to do a clambake on the beach for dinner. Knowing how you love doing that. - Oh, I just love them. - We're gonna go  to Virgin Gorda. We're gonna dock up at Leverick Bay. We got a critter-free pool coming. - Oh, is that the one with the nets? - It's the net, yeah.  - Okay. - Goes behind the boat. A critter-free pool  is a 20x40 pool, and it has a net  to keep all the jellyfish out. It's a dog and pony show. - Thank you.  - Cheers. - Sierra, did you see what happened? - How did this happen? Because it was left on it? Because it was hot? So is it burned? It's easy to forget, like... - I think it's burned through. It was really hot  and crisp earlier. - Oh, no. I mean, it's confusing. I don't know. - Happened to us as well, so don't worry. - Bummer. ¶ ¶ - What do you think  you're gonna make for lunch? - We're gonna do a nine-course  tasting menu for the dog. - We could just take  all the leftovers from the crew food  and give that to the guests so you can focus on the dog. - Why don't we actually just have the guests eat with the crew? So then we can just give the dog our undivided attention. Hey. - What is the beach clambake? Is that dinner? - I was thinking we could take an early dinner, like 4:30 to 6:30, 'cause the sun goes down  at 6:30, and then all of the sand fleas  and mosquitoes and stuff will be out in force. - That's an extremely early dinner. - Gets dark early.  - That's gonna be two dinners. - 'Cause then they're  gonna eat again. - 'Cause then they're gonna want to eat at 10:00 again. - I'm just letting you guys know what it's gonna be  like out there. - I'm a little perturbed. A 4:30 clambake on the beach  screws my day up. I'm unclear how this evening  is going to unravel. I think we should say the clambake's an early dinner, and then we can--  and then we'll roll and-- and then we'll spoil them. - I'm just gonna call it "clambake." - Just say  an "early dinner clambake." - I'm just saying "clambake." - Trevor, Trevor,  this is Kelley. Meeting in the swim platform. - No problem. - Come on down. Last night... is unacceptable,  period, end of story. Unacceptable. You, as of right now, are no longer a senior deckhand. You will not boss them around. You will not basically  say sh-- to anybody. Your job is to f---ing clean, make sure everything's  getting done, and that's it. - Yes, sir. You can try to demote me, but you're not  gonna get me down, and you're not gonna deplete  my knowledge of my position. - If I see anything happen,  I will push to have you gone. - Yes, sir. - All right,  go get back to work. - F---. - This is Scupper. - You and I are gonna have  lots of fun. - The dog gets treated better than 90% of the children  in the United States. - Scupper can't hold his liquor. - You've never been to London,  have you? - Mm-mm, do you have a place? - Now when I go back,  I stay with my mom, and I visit my dad. Are your parents together? - No. - Are they divorced,  or... - My dad passed away  when I was 16. - 16, and you moved out  after that? - Yeah.  - Was it a shock? - No, he was sick. - Aw. - It was really hard for us  when my dad passed away. It actually kind of like separated my family  a little bit, because everyone's grief  was so intense. It was kind of hard  to connect at that point. - What was wrong with him? - With his passing,  I was kind of lost, and I went through life kind of searching for something. And I think with yachting,  I found it. But we'll see. - You don't have to talk  about it, don't worry. - Yeah, I'd rather not. - Okay, of course. - Morning, Captain.  - What's up? - I kind of wanted to give you  a rundown of last night, 'cause Trevor just  is a big, big problem. It got to the point  where I had to send him to bed. - Did you talk to him today? - Yes, I did talk to him  today. I basically told him  he was demoted and he's no longer  senior deckhand. - Kelley handled it very well. From what I see so far, I like the way Kelley  is attacking his job. You deal with it.  - Roger that. Will do. Thank you, Captain. ¶ ¶ - Attention, deck crew. I need everybody out here to assist with the delivery  we got coming on board. Oh, sh--, it's the pool. ¶ ¶ - Holy f--- balls. - Thanks. - Go ahead and take it out of the bag for now. - Ready?  - Yep. - One, two, three. - Oh, sh--. - That's a friggin'  heavy pool. - It's a big joint. Ah! F---, that hurt! - Well done, guys. - - Yeah. - Attention all crew,  in five minutes, I need everybody  on the aft deck. Come on, ladies. - Look at that. Nice. - Ben, I got them walking  down the dock. Get your ass out here now. They're walking up the gangway. - Hello.  - Hi! - Hi.  - Captain Lee. - Pleasure. - Hey, Captain Lee, great to see you. - Good to meet you.  Douglas. This is Scupper. - You and I are gonna have  lots of fun. - Hi, Nico. These people love yachting. This is not just guests where we can get away  with a few things. We really need to make sure that we don't mess anything up. - Welcome aboard the "Valor."  - Thank you. - Kate will show you to your quarters and give you a tour of the boat, and we'll start having a good time. - Cheers, thank you all. - Hi, guys, we'll go  in the main salon first. - Oh, this is lovely. - It's a very modern boat.  - It sure is, great job. - What size boats do y'all have? - We have a 55 Azimut. - Oh, yeah. - We have a 70 Hatteras. - And we dock  a Grey Poupon bottle toss away from each other. - Oh, I like that saying. - We'll go to the sun deck,  which is the very fun level. It's got a nice Jacuzzi with a good view. - Oh, nice. - And now we'll go down to the guest quarters. He's like a little baby,  hugging him. I'm pretty sure  the dog gets treated better than 90% of the children  in the United States. - Everybody in position? - Yes, sir,  everybody's in position. - Bow to stern. ¶ ¶ - Hey, good job. - She's coming out. - Nico, let us know  when all lines are in. - Okay, Cap,  all lines are clear. - Perfect. - No traffic astern, Captain,  no traffic astern. - Hey, great job.  That went smooth as buttah. - Smooth as a baby's bum. - He has a tuxedo. - Oh! - Maybe we could just  steam it a little bit. - Of course, yep. What a lucky pup. - Guys, what's the plan like? Are we gonna go  to the beach, or-- - Perfect timing. We were originally thinking  around 4:00, 4:30 for the clambake. But how hungry are you? Can you wait till 4:00? - Whatever--yeah. Yeah, we're good. - Okay, good, good. - No stress on him. - No!  - Yeah! - He cooks his best when he's... - Yes, mellow. ¶ ¶ - Deck crew, let's get ready for  a starboard side tie, please. - Roger that. - Okay, it's gonna be  starboard too. A lot of boat  in a small marina. - It's a bitch of a wind. - What's the distance  on my port side? - 80 feet and closing. - That is way too small a dock. - We're going into  a really small marina, and the wind is blowing  the boat off the dock, so the deck crew are really gonna have to keep  their head in the game. - What do you think, Scupper? - The situation, this is like  driving a giant sail. That's why he's coming in  cockeyed like this. - Run that stern line all  the way back, one more cleat. Take up on it right away,  let's go. - Yep--here we go. - Barry's got the bow. - The bow is good, you're in.  - He knows his stuff. It's not his first time  at the rodeo. - Nice job, deckhands,  thank you. - Deck crew, deck crew, grab  all the beach picnic supplies, and load them in the tender. - Sierra, I'm gonna put you in charge of collecting these items.  - Okay. - And then, Emily,  if you'll just stay on service checking  on the guests? Thank you. - I like beaches. Please don't get  your nose full of sand. - Which beach are we going to? - Right over there. Watch that f---ing rebar. ¶ ¶ - Oh. - Scupper can't hold his liquor. - We need some towels.  - It's not a big deal. Just Scupper threw up. - Okay, Scupper, say you're sorry. - Thank you, Emily,  do you want us to do that? - Oh, no, no, don't worry. Providing excellent service means providing excellent  service for everyone, including Scupper. - Kisses? ¶ ¶ - I don't understand why Captain Lee said we had to do this party so early. I don't feel like there's any bugs here. - Hey, do you want me to go  pick them up now? - Yeah, I think the guests  are just getting ready, so you can be  on standby there. - Roger that. - Look how nice. ¶ ¶ - Just grab one side, perfect. It's a heavy f---er. - All right,  three, two, one. - No, don't throw it. Okay, good. - We're gonna play with the dog. - Here's the diet tonic. - Thank you.  - You're welcome. - Cheers.  - Cheers, cheers, cheers. - Take the handle, and we're gonna just hoof it over to that station. - Let me know when.  - Okay, go. - Let me know...  - Nice job, thank you. That was easy. F---ing hell, where the hell  did these flies come from? - Kate, you know  what I was thinking? Could we push dinner  to 9:00? - Yes, of course, 'cause this is a late meal. - We're not gonna be hungry.  - Yeah. - Perfect, I love it. It's gonna be a great time. - Okay, Sierra,  you go with that. I can get more flies  by the time you come back. - Pardon me, guys. And here... There you are.  - Wow, look at that. - There's a lobster tail for everyone. - Okay, guys, these are spiny lobster tails. I'm so sorry about the flies, gosh. - These flies are like,  you've never seen a lobster and a clambake before? Jesus! - Very good.  - Okay, brilliant. - What time is it now?  - 10 to 6:00. And they said that they would like to push dinner back. - But whoever mentioned dinner? - I don't know. - And you didn't call this  an early dinner? - I don't think if I called it the last meal of your life, that would prevent them from becoming hungry later. Three things you encounter  in life: death, taxes, and Ben getting angry  when asked to cook food. - We always said  this was a late dinner. It's 6:00, right? 6:00's dinner time. - I think that you're getting prematurely aggravated. - No, I'm not, actually.  - Okay, good. - It's just  when people don't listen to me, this is what happens. "Yes, Chef,"  is not part of her vocabulary. - In case they come up to me  and start talking about dinner, which is what  they are calling it... - We're doing tapas. You gonna communicate it  with the guests? - I am, but not while they're eating their dessert. - Perfect, I just wanted  to make sure. - Okay, great, yeah. And would you like to know what time? - Hey, Kelley, come in,  it's Ben, please. Can I get a pickup, please? - Roger that, I'll be  leaving in just a sec. - All right, thank you. - Such a diva. ¶ ¶ - Get the f--- over yourself,  man. Go back to the Marine Corps  or something. - Just let it go.  - No, I'm not letting it go. - Kelley, Kelley, come in,  it's Ben, please. Can I get a pickup, please? - Roger that, I'll be leaving  in just a sec. - Here, and you can take  this back with you. - Kate, you have four people  here, all right? Sort it out. Cheers, guys,  I'll see you later. - Okay.  No, we're good, we're good. - Yeah, I need to go back  to the boat, though, 'cause I got to feed the crew. - What was that about? - He's just having  a diva moment, because he feels like  he's gonna have to cook more, but that's kind of the job. - Kate refuses to communicate with the guests, and now the guests still think that they're having a sit-down dinner. And it's like, you know, this should have been discussed hours ago with them. Most people  are actually afraid of Kate, but I'm not afraid of anyone. We're obviously going through  a power struggle right now, and I'm not gonna back down, because I'm setting a precedent for the rest  of the charter season. - Are you all done here?  - Yes. - Thank you.  - My pleasure. - That's what they were fighting about. - Kelley, Kelley, Kate.  - Go ahead for Kelley. - I think the guests and I are  ready to go back to the boat. - All right, I'm on my way. - Whenever you guys are ready,  the tender is on standby. - Hello! - Can you grab some butter out of that fridge? - Thank you. - What are you doing? - I'm prepping dog food  right now. Please don't disturb. - Can you please tell me  what you'd like to serve so I can sell it to them? - This is what  is gonna happen. I'm gonna talk to the guests, because clearly you are  terrible at it, thank you. - Is this your first charter? - I've known Kate  for many years, and when she starts  putting up resistance, I have to take matters  into my own hands. - Can you radio to Kate to have Kelley bring more bags? - Kelley, Kelley, Trevor. Hey, man, bring some trash bags  back when you come back to help us break down. - You mean, "Bring the trash bags, please"? - Okay, well, bring  trash bags back, please? Get the f--- over yourself,  man. Go back to the Marine Corps  or something. - All we need to do is just say please and thank you. - I said, "Hey, can I get  some trash bags?" Demoted or not, I know I have  way more experience than any of the other deckhands,  including Kelley. And I think I should  be respected for all that. Like, I could  totally be boatswain. - But, I mean, it's that attitude that's obviously pissing him off. - That's not my attitude,  though. I go about everything  his way for anything. - Just let it go.  - No, I'm not letting it go. I'm gonna f---ing lose it  tonight, I guarantee it. - Hey, guys, how are you?  - Not too bad. - Good, so it's completely  up to you. I just felt like,  at this point in the evening, you might not want, like,  a serious formal dinner. It might be more fun to roll with some exciting  tapas options. - This is embarrassing. Ben is trying to do my job. He is being a total dick. - That'd be great. - So what time would you like that, do you think? - 9:00-ish.  - 9:00 work for you? - Yeah, that's brilliant. What's your favorite food? I want to make sure  he's happy. - Well, mine is turkey bacon.  - Is it? - I would say that's my favorite. - Okay, absolutely perfect. Enough said, thank you so much.  - Got it? - Take care. - Thanks, Kate.  - My pleasure. ¶ ¶ - Kate, you saw me  getting stressed earlier 'cause I didn't know  what was going on. Three hours later, I still  didn't know what was going on. - My ultimate goal in asking you  what you planned on making-- "Do you guys want a relaxed tapas "kind of informal thing, or do you want a sit-down dinner?" Three hours ago, I wanted that answer. - Whoa. - And you were just buying time. - All I've got is time. All I've got on this boat is a bunch of time on this boat. - Something happened;  they were fighting. - I'm not like you,  I'm not like, "I don't feel like  working past 9:00." - I don't feel like that. What? Oh, now you're trying  to label me as lazy. - I don't know what your problem  right now is. - My problem is, is communicate  with the guests, or I'm gonna communicate  instead. That's my problem. - I communicated tapas. - If they're arguing  like that, make sure the door  to the galley is closed. - You don't know  what communication is. - Don't I? I think I communicated very well with them. - Oh, selectively. - At least I got  definitive answers from them. - I wanted definitive answers  from you. - Well, that was the problem, wasn't it? - Want it downstairs now? - No, we're gonna do, if we can, without making a mess with the chef, we want to do his dinner.  - Sure. - Hello. - Chef Ben,  are you ready for me? - There's no time  like the present. Here we go. - I'm just finishing up  the dog's supplements. Have you ever seen a dog  need so many vitamins? - That dog's probably  healthier than I am. - He's never had brown rice,  but I'm sure he'll love it. ¶ ¶ And then the Scupper  is good to go. Thank you, Chef. Boy, look at this. There you go. ¶ ¶ - All right, what is the most efficient way to do this? - Unload it all,  and then... - Should we unload it  to the side there, and then-- - That's what she was saying. Come here, Trevor, come here. Come on, let's go. - Oh, my God,  this is so annoying. - I'm tired of getting chewed out for everything. You're making me look horrible. - You're making yourself  look bad. - I feel undermined as f--- by you. - No, you're not  being undermined. I'm your f---ing boss. - Really? I'm busting my ass, man. - Dude, everybody's busting  their f---ing ass, everybody. What, you think  you're f---ing special? You're the only problem  that I have, and everybody sees it. I tried being nice to him,  but at this point, Mr. Nice Boatswain is gone. I'm just tired of excuses. Just say, "My bad,  next time we got it." ¶ ¶ - Can I get you a drink?  - Yes, please. - Sure, gin and tonic? - Diet, if you have it.  - Absolutely. - Thank you. You look so pretty. - Thank you so much. Did you want alcohol? - That would be the gin part. - Oh, okay. - Okay, thank you. - You ready, little man?  - Come on, man. - Come on, bud. - Well, how pretty is this? - Look how beautiful you are.  - Thank you. - We're about ready for dinner, right? - Yeah, I think so.  - That would be perfect. - Okay.  - Thank you, Kate. - What do you think  is the time, Ben, until I can  bring a platter out? - You didn't say they were at the table. - They're ready to eat, so if you want  to put it on platters, great, let's do it. - Turkey bacon, crab cake,  truffle sauce. - Okay, thanks. So first, we have a crab cake with a truffle  remoulade sauce. And this is the turkey bacon. - I knew I smelled the turkey bacon. - The food is really good.  - Oh, God, yeah. - Very good.  - Good. - Are they liking? - I don't hover over them while  they take their first bite, but I'll keep you posted. - Okay, hon, like just a..."Yes, they like it." - I will let you know. - As long as they're not  throwing it over the side at this point, it's okay. - I don't know,  they might be. ¶ ¶ - F---ing hell. - Now we have a seared tuna with a truffle balsamic glaze. - He must have been  real pissed at you, Kate. - How could you tell? - Exactly. - I mean, you guys  only have two nights. I don't fault you at all for wanting to have  a nice sit-down dinner. I'm more than tired of this. Have I spoiled Ben too much  by being, like, accommodating? Now, for dessert, we have a deconstructed blueberry pie. - Oh, there you go. - What we want you to do now is,  we want you to go in and tell him we want  a full breakfast at 6:00 a.m. - Eggs Benedict.  - He hates that, right? - He needs to learn a lesson  like a toddler. Like, he needs  to be put in time-out. He clearly has lost sight  of how to behave. - Great job, little man. - Scuffer,  we're going this way. - Good night.  - Good night. - This has been one of the most  exhausting days of my life, mentally and physically. Kate's been a bloody nightmare, and I'm really over it  right now. ¶ ¶ Breakfast is at 9:00. ¶ ¶ - You guys want me  to take one with you? I can cheers one with you  if it's the last night. Fair winds  and following seas. ¶ ¶ - Attention all deck crew, let's get ready  for departure. - Roger that. - We got to get the gangway in. I'm gonna go to the bow. - Nice morning. - Go down a little bit  more your way. - See that spacer on top? - Let me know  when everybody's in position so we can get  out of here, Kelley. - On the bow, waiting to go. - Roger that, Captain. - Why the f--- did he radio  over the f--- mic? - Who?  - Trevor. - Once that's in,  go ahead and get your lines. - All right. - We're good. - All right, let's start  with this, bow to stern. - Roger, bow to stern. - Bow line is in. - Both stern lines in, Captain. - Looks pretty good.  Good job. ¶ ¶ - Hello, good morning,  how'd you sleep? - Good.  - Good. - Good morning.  - Good morning, Kate. - The dog doesn't  get seasick, huh? - So far.  - Has it ever? - Like, even when  he was a puppy? No? - He doesn't like smaller boats. - Too restrictive. - All right, people,  here we go. Eggs Florentine  with turkey bacon. - Okay. So we have eggs Benedict  Florentine with turkey bacon. - That looks beautiful. - Wow, this is really good. So good.  - It's delicious. - Very good. - Happy? - The only person not happy  is you. ¶ ¶ - All right, Kelley, leads,  get this anchor dropped. - Roger that.  We're on our way up. - I need four shots,  go ahead and drop. - Roger that, four shots,  dropping now. ¶ ¶ - Okay, lock it in.  - Roger that. - I do feel a little ostracized,  a little alienated with the whole deck crew  and everything. And I really think Kelley  is the f---ing whole problem. - Roger that. Thank you, sir. - Is it possible for us to get Scupper off? - Captain Lee, come in. - What do you need? - Guest was wondering if we  could take them to the beach 'cause Scupper needs  to use the restroom. - Can you run them in? - Copy that. ¶ ¶ - The guests are still  ashore, yeah? - Yes, master. - Yeah, we got to stop  this bullsh--, babe. Can we both, like,  reach some kind of agreement? - I don't know, but...  see you next Tuesday. - You're a Tuesday. It's no fun arguing with Kate, because if I wind her up,  she won't show it. And then she'll really  wind me up. And, you know, okay, maybe  she's better at it than me. But that's not something  I want to focus on in life, is pissing people off. - You're right, I'm a Tuesday  every day of the week. - And you never take a f---ing day off. - Not a lot of grass. - But you found a spot. - All nice and new and shiny. It's almost a shame  to put it in the water. You're gonna need another person. - Nico, Nico, get back here to the swim deck. - Find a air port? - You've got one  on each end, I'm sure. - Oh, here's one, over here. One, two... No, no, no, no, we don't want it on that side. - Oh, boy, 'cause this  isn't sinking. - That's not gonna be good,  sh--. - What a pain in the ass  this thing is. - Hey, Nico, we're gonna bring you some shackles to put in there. - On the center one here, and on the center one over there. Are there any corners  that are still up at all? Do you have any extra weight  in those back three? - Nico, let's go, man.  Good job. ¶ ¶ - I thought it was supposed  to keep the critters out. - Don't worry, there's a net  under us in the pool. - Thank you.  - You're welcome. - How was it, guy?  - Very fun. - They used it  for about five minutes and realized they look  like babies inside of a baby pen. So glad I set that up for you. ¶ ¶ - I have to iron  Scupper's tuxedo. - Wow. - Hey, Kate, do you think  this would be okay if I just steamed it? - Just on the lowest setting, and go real quick. - Okay. - Don't burn the baby's  clothes, Sierra. Just don't burn  the baby's clothes. - Look at this. He's all set. - Hey, Ben,  can I seat the guests? - Yes, you may. - Shellfish risotto. - Ready?  - Yes, I am. - Yay.  - Are you good with three? - Yeah.  - Yeah, brilliant, cheers. - And we have seafood risotto. Lobster, mussels, and clams. - Wow. - Enjoy.  - Thank you. - Hey, Kel. - Hey, what are you doing? - Oh, just at the house,  hanging out. It's so good to talk to you! - It's good to talk to you. I've missed you. - Oh, my gosh, I miss you too. - My sister's on another boat with a captain  that she's dating. And I kind of wish  she was here right now. - Did you poot?  - No. - Oh, my gosh, Kelley. That is so rank, seriously. Okay, spill the beans. Who is everyone? - Okay, so I have one deckhand who has been nothing  but a pain in my ass. - Oh, gosh. - My other two  are like golden children. They're great.  He just gets so defensive. First thing he does is he comes out, gets in the hot tub. Nico comes in,  and Trevor's like, "Oh, cool tattoo, bro,  but the shading's sh--." - So can I have it straight? There's three dudes  in a hot tub arguing about a tattoo?" Wait a second. - Oh, I hate you so much  right now. Talking to my sister  is really good. And she'll usually give me a good opposite version  of what I would do. F---, I love my sister. She's the sh--. - Tipping my hat to ya. - All right. - Okay, well, I miss you. - Did you know that the Germans  had trained poodles in the 17th century  to dive for lobster? - Okay, Ben, we're ready  for dessert whenever you are. - Emily, you're gonna be late girl. - Okay. - Dinner goes surprisingly well when Kate's not acting  like a mega bee-hatch. I need more nights like this. - Tiramisu.  - Oh, good. - Thank you. - I want to go in the hot tub. - We're just  gonna take Scupper out. You ready, buddy? ¶ ¶ - Here we go. ¶ ¶ - I just had a f---ing long day. And what's one shot of liquor  gonna do to a guy like me who can drink  a f---ing full bottle? Nothing. Fair winds  and following seas. - You got it, bro. - This is a total no-no. But it's not my nature to tell  on another crew member. I don't know  if you should have done that. - I'm not worried about it. Doesn't matter. ¶ ¶ - Did you just chug that? - What are you doing, man? - Just chill the f--- out. - Ben being a dick,  you being a bitch. - You know what? You're done with that. ¶ ¶ - Ready to get some coffee, hon?  - Yeah. - All right, guys, let's pull it  up and get out of here. - Two shots, there you go. - Let's get it in  and get out of here. - Sit, speak. - Ooh! ¶ ¶ - It must be good if no one's talking. - I know. - We're ready. - All right,  we're coming all stop. - Roger that. - No traffic astern, and plenty of room  on the channel marker, Cap. ¶ ¶ - Lock it in. - F--- yeah. - So when are we  coming back? Soon, I hope. - Next week. - Attention all crew, I need everybody  on the aft deck in five. - Have to say good-bye. Come on, we got to  say good-bye. - There we go. - Enjoy New York. - Thank you for everything. - See you later,  you come back. - It was, like,  the greatest trip. I didn't have to worry about  any boat problems whatsoever. Thank you all. Thank you so much,  really appreciate it. - Bye.  - Bye, guys. - Bye.  - Thank you. - Bye, Scupper. - Let's go to work. ¶ ¶ - Just see how hard  old maid's working right now. He's loving life. - Where is he?  - Where do you think? - Having a ciggy? - I just see him sitting  on the tender, not doing jack sh--. - What the f---? - Attention all crew, I need everybody  in the crew mess immediately. ¶ ¶ So I think this charter was--thought it was okay. You know, like kissing your sister. I think one of the things we need to work on, though, is a communication breakdown, specifically about the clambake. - I did the best job  to the best of my abilities, and I don't know  why I get dogged for every frickin' tip meeting. This communication thing,  yeah, it's diabolical. - So we do have some money to divvy up here. It wasn't as much as the last one. A little under 12 grand. $1,085 apiece. - We do need to work  on our communication. But I don't think  Captain Lee knows the extent of Ben's freak-out, and if he had, he would have  called him out a bit more. - You can go out tonight. But remember that it's a work day. We need to crank it today. - Sounds good.  - Thanks, Captain. - Thank you. ¶ ¶ - So what do you want to do? What's the game plan  for tonight? Get a little food,  get a little drinks? - Make a little love,  get down tonight? - Yeah...  - Yeah? - Is this our  anniversary today? - Yeah.  - Congratulations. - Yeah, made it to our first week. - Oh, my God. - It's so hard to believe that I've only known Nico  for two charters, 'cause I feel like we've known  each other forever. It's just really easy  on so many levels. And he's--  I mean, yeah, he's cute. - Ooh! ¶ ¶ - Did the girls go out for tanning? - They're, like,  meditating and sh--. - So relaxing. - Huh. ¶ ¶ - Ooh, Jesus. ¶ ¶ - Emily's cute. She's got an amazing accent. And it's been five months,  people. - What is she doing?  - They're trying to de-stress. ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ - When's Ro coming? - Soon. - I'm probably a better  soccer player, than him. - He's probably  a better chef than you. - These are cutie cute. - Thanks. Yeah, they're comfy too. - Yeah, nice. - Gimme some positive vibes. Let's have some f---ing fun. ¶ ¶ - Oh, my. ¶ ¶ Can I get a painkiller? - Can we get four total, please? And then what do you guys want? - Vodka, dirty, please. - Can she get it filthy, please? Make it hard. - I want to say it is so much  fun working with all of you. And, yeah, let's get weird. - I hear that. - As if we're not weird enough. - Let's get weirder. - I never thought of it that way. - That's why I don't drink  out of martini glasses. - Did you just chug that? - No, Trevor did. - Your hair, it's gorgeous, though. You do a very good job every time. - Thank you. - I could style your hair  f---ing phenomenally. - Wow. - I modeled for Paul Mitchell  for two years almost. I could show you guys some of my modeling pictures. You go into a Paul Mitchell catalog still to this day, you'll see me in the long hair. - All right,  let's get out of here. - She's ready.  - Yes. - Can I get a Bud Light, a Stoli soda, and two filthy martinis? - Uh, what are you doing, dude? Where do you think  this is gonna go? - There's swings over there. - Yeah, I think we should  switch over to those, huh? - Yeah, look, come. - Oh, my God, they're going  out there to f---. - You got it?  - Yeah. Oh, my God! - I'm gonna shred her p----  on the f---ing rocks while my d--- gets crabs. - What are you talking about? - I don't know how--  I don't know how to do anything but talking about it. - I think somebody's asking for you over there. - Oh, sh--. Whoa. - So, tell me... - Kelley's quite cute  and good-looking, but I'm very picky. And I have to get to know  someone quite deeply before anything happens. - Don't touch our swing. - Don't touch. - Trevor is beyond a certain  inebriated threshold. He just acts  like a complete tosser. You're sh--faced. - I'm sh--faced? - I think so. - Because I'm telling you  something different? - You're not  telling me anything. - Ben being a dick,  you being a bitch? - I'm actually a dick. Choose your words, be creative. - That makes me annoyed, when you call her a bitch. It does. I'm the only person that's  allowed to call her a bitch. I'm sorry.  - Yeah, it's true. - Hey, hey. - What the f--- is it with you, man? - Dude, f--- off.  - Just chill out. - F--- off, man.  - You need to chill out. - You're crazy.  - I know. - I f---ing love you, though. - Okay, good. Then keep loving me, baby,  and stop annoying me. - You know what? You're done with that. Just chill the f--- out. - Next time on "Below Deck." - This is a group  of entrepreneurs. - We're making more money  right now than most people make  in a year. - Ah! - One guest doesn't eat meat. Gluten-free, dairy-free,  wheat-free. And then they wanted a formal  dinner on the first night with 12-course tasting menu. - Sh--. - I have not done  a 12-course service before. Ben seems very stressed out  about this 12-course meal. I could offer  to prepare something. - Good.  - Okay. - That tuna's f---ed. I don't want to serve it anymore. Just deal with it, okay? I have to get this food out. - I can't deal with this. I'm over it. - ¶ Time to make that money ¶ Sh--. - Shut the f--- up!  - Hey, bro. - Got a PTSD f---ing Marine  as my f---ing boatswain. - I think that once  is an accident. Twice is a pattern. Do I believe there'll be a third time? Without a doubt. I know how to handle this.
