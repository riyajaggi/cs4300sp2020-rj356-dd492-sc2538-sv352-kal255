 so I'm prepared for anything that's gonna come in the door. - Mix those separately. - That dog is probably - healthier than I am. 90% of my job is just acting - like everything's fine - when it's not. - [hair rips] - [screaming] Both: Thank you. - It's kind of sick, - the back hair - That I carried away - on a silver tray. - Is this shackle? - Yeah, that'll work. - - When the boatswain's - not there, I am in charge of the deckies. And I need to know that my deckhands respect me. - Nico, go drain the hot tub now, - quick, quick. - My name is Nico. They also call me Freako, because of my, uh, misconduct. - Actually, that's quite nice. I love Nico so much; he's so cute. - Elvis is out, people, huh! - Being on deck, you know, it's predominantly male-driven. - . - All right, you guys, come on. - A lot of times, - guys will be like... - It's kind of heavy. - You okay with it? - I'm like, - "I can carry it. It's fine." - She's strong. - But all my makeup Is waterproof, 'cause I sweat buckets. - I usually give off first impressions of being very normal and conforming, but I'm not really that normal. [thumping club music] - [cheering] - Yeah-yeah! - This position is definitely - the most exciting Position in the world. - My whole life, I've been - a happy, precocious, Free-spirited... [people humming mantras] Humble person. - The people that charter these boats know what they want. - I want my feet rubbed, - and I'm not kidding. - And it's up to us - to deliver. - Yeah, we're gonna - give it to you. [cheering] - God bless America, let's have f... ing fun. [cheering] - It's an unknown journey. - I'm here to work. - I'm not here - to have drama. - It's dangerous. - What the f...? - That is a power line. - Oh, sh... - - It's chaotic. - Sh...! - I'd be surprised - if we got - Through it - without a casualty or two. - God damn it! - Ooh! - But... nature of the beast. [horn blaring] [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ - Oh, my gosh. This is like my dream interior. I am so happy. I'm so happy to see you here, and you, love you. - Hey, kiddo. - Hi, how are you? I always enjoy working for Captain Lee. We know each other's quirks, we know each other's strengths, and he trusts me. What's not to trust? - Third time around. - The charm. - What do you think? - Best boat we've ever had. - She just came out - of a total refit on the inside. - There is nothing on this boat - that's not white. - I love that. - As far as your stews go, - I brought you résumés. They're both experienced. - Oh, she's British, - okay, cool. - Coming onto a boat - with two new stews Is definitely nerve-wracking. - Down to the crew quarters. - All right, sweetie. - But anything's gonna be easier than working with Rocky. - I need you to be thankful - for this experience. - This is me. - Don't... - [crying] - She's gonna jump. - Yeah, she's jumping. - Welcome back. - Good to be back. - Captain Lee? Hey, Captain, how you doing? - Our last charter season, - I was with Captain Lee, I was a second engineer, - and this season, - I'm coming in as boatswain. - This is me stepping up - and hopefully - Doing at least as good - as Eddie. - I believe everybody gets a second opportunity. And I really don't want to see you screw the pooch. - I don't plan on it. - I'm hoping that - you've grown up In the last couple of years. - Yes, sir. - First time didn't go - too hot. - We have nothing to talk about. You need to go to your quarters. - Happy birthday to Kelley! - [retching] - Why are we not on deck? - [banging] - Wake up! - I'm still drunk. I want to show Captain Lee - that this is my career; - this is what - I want to do - with the rest of my life. - We got a pretty good - crew for you. - You've got a senior deckhand; - he's been in - A boatswain's position before. - Okay. - And then you've got - a girl and another guy. Both of them are experienced, - so you shouldn't have - any issues. - Perfect. - They're your responsibility. If your crew's screwing up, - you're the one I'm gonna - come looking for. - Running three people - can be very difficult. - You got to get them all - working as a team - To accomplish a goal - without fighting each other, Or fighting me. - Hi. - Hey. - Long time, no see. - I know. - So you decided - to go one more round? - Yeah, yeah. - That's great. Even though I haven't seen Kelley in a long time, I am friends with his sister Amy, and I have heard about how many courses Kelley has taken and how determined he is to impress Captain Lee this time. - Hopefully we can do pretty well this season. - Hello, lovely to meet you. - Good to meet you. Kelley. - Emily. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Hello, lovely to meet you. - I'm Kate. - Emily. - I've been single for eight months now. - So you're my stewardess, - one of them. - I'm your stewardess, yes. - But the problem is, - it's been five months of no sex. - Here, let's - get you comfortable. - Trouble. It's just gonna be trouble for me. Oh, sh... - Hey, how's it going, man? - Kelley. - Kelley. Nico. - Hi, I'm Kate. - Nico, nice to meet you. - I grew up on the outskirts - of Chicago. I was one of five boys. My father wasn't around, so my mom raised us by herself. - You're gonna be up - in starboard forward. - Okay. - It was very difficult. - I wasn't making - The right decisions. - I wasn't doing good in school. But I moved down to Florida to begin yachting at 18, and I kind of turned my life around for the best. Definitely taking top bunk. - Hi. Lauren. - Nice to meet you. - Kelley, nice to meet you. - Hi, Kelley. - Kate... actually, - you're gonna be my roommate. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - So where you from? - Australia. - What part? - Melbourne. - I'm from Melbourne... - Oh, really? - Florida. - So you're Melbourne - down under, And I'm Melbourne up over. - Yeah. - We're like cousins. - I got into yachting - 'cause I was A scuba diving instructor in Central America. My first gig was on Sir Richard Branson's sailing yacht. So that was a really good first job - to sort of understand - all the aspects of yachting, Which I thought was awesome. - Yeah, go ahead - and get changed over, - And then meet Nico - out on the deck. - Okay, cool. - How's it going? - Kelley. - Trevor, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. All right, Lauren, Trevor. - Hi, Trevor, - nice to meet you... Lauren. - Senior deckhand. This is Kate. - Kate, Trevor, - senior deckhand. - I'm Emily. - Trevor, I'm senior deckhand. - I'm labeling your uniform. - Thank you. - On a boat this size, - usually I'd be the boatswain. You want to show me my bunk? - Yeah, you're gonna - grab your clothes. - But I came on - as senior deckhand - 'cause you take what comes - at you and you run with it. - Which room am I? - Port forward. - I don't consider myself - a boss, - 'cause I've been - in the lower person's shoes, - And I've worked my way up, - so I understand that. - So if I had the choice of boss, - it'd probably be me. - Wow, this place is nice. [knocking] - Ben. - Hello. [laughter] - - The funny thing about - this boat, "Valor," Is, I actually worked on it 12 years ago as a day worker. - And I just thought, - how wonderful would it be To cook on a boat like this? - You check out your galley? - Yeah, it's lovely, it's clean. Having just come back from the Mediterranean, it's really nice to work another season with Kate. - Oh, there she is. - Hi. - What's up? - Nothing, how are you? - Good, how are you? - Good. - We've been great friends, and we were a little more than that at one point. - Getting the tour? - Yeah. Both: Nice. - But sometimes that does complicate our working relationship. This is a proper boat. - Yes. - Whoa. - I see weights. - They're like 5 pounds. - Not enough. So do you have anybody special in your life right now? - Yeah, I am - dating somebody. - Who? - I just met her. - Ooh, a her, huh? - Yeah, it's new. - That's awesome. - [chuckles] - I was not expecting that. - You know, - it really doesn't matter, As long as it makes you happy. - So my girlfriend's name is Ro. - She's, like, - a professional athlete. She wears combat boots. - I think it shows - how great she is, To make me attracted to a girl, 'cause I never was. Am I gay, am I not gay? I don't know. I am in sexual limbo, and not like in a fun "Kama Sutra page 96" way, intermediate level sexual limbo. It's complicated. It's crazy. - That's cool. - Yeah. - So how's it going? - How's it going, Nico? - Trevor. - Good to meet you, man. - Senior deckhand. - Thank you. - So, guys, Trevor's gonna be - the senior deckhand, - So what he says goes, 'cause - it's probably coming from me. - Just because we are - higher-ups, - Feel free to bounce - things off of us. - I mean, we don't - know everything. - Higher-up, okay, that's fine. I worked on a 223-foot super-yacht with 17 crew. So I think I know what higher-up means. - If he doesn't know exactly - what he thinks about it, - He'll bounce it off me, - and we'll make a decision. Smarter, not harder. - "Hey, I'm Trevor, - I'm the senior deckhand." - My one rule is, - don't f... around - with the guests. We're here to serve them. - We're not here - to party with them. - We're not their friends. - Yeah. - If I catch you kissing a guest - or something like that, - I'm gonna have you gone - as quick as possible. - Trevor's been a boatswain. - He's been a first mate On a smaller yacht; Nico and Lauren are experienced. - And it looks like I'm gonna have - a pretty strong deck crew. - Let's just tone it down a bit. - I don't know what - you think of us. - I mean, the guests - are coming tomorrow. I've got so much to do. - Do you want us to be - going around and doing... - Gonna be doing, like, - hot shots with the boat? That's a great name. - I love that surname. - Sierra Storm, - sounds like a super hero. - That's amazing. - Attention all crew, - we got provisions now. - So let's get everybody - out there to load it up. - How heavy is it? - It's pretty heavy. - Oh, it is heavy. - You can definitely - handle this one. - Oh, yeah. - I love your company so much. - And you see the soft-shell? - Oh, good, I love - soft-shell crab, do you? - Oh, absolutely. - Is that Ben's voice I hear? - Hey. - What's going on? - How's it going? - Very good. How are you? - Oh, looks like you got - plenty of food in there. - So you're in charge this year, - are you? - Yeah. - Wow, Kelley is the boatswain. Good luck, champ. - Well, that's good. - It's a little terrifying. - It's probably more terrifying - for them, I'd imagine. [laughter] - So do we have everyone? Did your other stew come? - Not yet. - Not yet, oh, okay. - I'll have to check - with the captain. - We could use her help, - for sure. - Do you know what time - my third stew's arriving? - No, no, I don't. - This is not good. - With less than 24 hours - before charter guests arrive, There is so much to do. - But I will look into that. - It's just a lot of work. Sh... - Nico, I saw you trying to take the top bunk. Sorry, I took the top bunk. I know you're tall, but I'm senior deckhand. - Let's get smashing. - Where you from - originally, Trevor? - Born in Atlanta, - but Pensacola Beach, Florida, - is home. I've been around the world. I've been a competitive surfer. - Been a hair model - for Paul Mitchell. Did 100-ton captain's lessons and engineering courses. I've worked in yachting for about 3 1/2 years. - I was a boatswain - of a 164-foot, Had three deckhands under me. I was also first mate of a 130-foot. - Just continue minding your line; - never forget about that. So, yeah, I mean, I know my boat sh... Whoo. - Hello, nice to meet you. - Hello, how are you? - I'm Emily. - Where are you from? - The U.K. - Yeah, so am I. - You're British? - Yeah, where you from? - London. I've been yachting for the last 2 1/2 years. I've cruised across the whole of the Med, the Caribbean. - So you spent all your time - in London, did you? - I went to boarding school in Sussex. - Okay, which one? - Eastbourne College. - I went to Bradfield. - I was very much into academia, - and I was going to go - to Cambridge To study psychology and politics, - but I wanted a bit more - out of life. And I love adventure. - I'm only 21; - you only live once. And it is the time of life to experience things - that you're not able - to do later on - When you want to settle down, - maybe. - Attention all crew. I need everybody in the main salon. - Copy. - Deck crew, - here's your response. [indistinct chatter] - Okay. The first thing I want to go over is, your stew never made the plane. - Okay. - So we're short. - Sh... - If you need me, - I'll help. - I know, thank you. - Guests arrive tomorrow. For those of you who don't know how I run a boat, it's pretty simple. You do your job. You don't embarrass yourself. - And you don't - embarrass the boat. We're not having cocktails while we're on charter. Follow those three rules, and we're gonna get along just fine. - Obviously none of us want - to screw up for Captain Lee. - You know, he's got - high standards, - But we have our basics, - which is, as long as - The job's done, - you can do what you want. - Just, you know, - don't be a dick-head. - I always walk around with some cash and plane tickets, - but I'd like to set - a record this year For just keeping one whole crew intact. Barry and Larry is our 1st officer and chief engineer. - I expect you - to cooperate with them - As much as you cooperate - with me. We'll all make lots of money, and things go a lot smoother. Carry on, we're good. - So how are you going - with the shirts down there? - I'm ironing all of them? - I like ironing - all of them before. - I don't want to have - a mad dash. - So we know what we have - to get done - Now that we have - one less set of hands. - I think Emily's gonna be - a great second stew. - Okay, great. - Yay. - She seems experienced, sweet, confident... I love her. She's adorable. - Yeah, she's English, - that's why. - Nico, girlfriend back home? - Kind of with someone, - but we just recently - started talking. - Oh, so it's just fresh. - Yeah. - So you're talking to someone - but not dating someone. - Yeah, what about you guys? - Oh, I'm single as can be. - Single and ready to mingle? - Yeah. - What about you there, Lauren? - I'd say probably single - as a Pringle. Let's put it that way. - Ooh, that's good; - Pringles are f... ing delicious, - By the way. - They're great. - Eye-candy-wise, - Nico and Kelley, - You know, they're both cute - and flirty. - I mean, it's nice to work - with someone - That's good to look at, - you know? - Once you pop, - you can't stop, eh? - [laughs] - - Ben, Kate, Kelley, - I need you guys - Down in the crew mess - in five minutes For prepping meeting. - Copy. - First one, we have eight ladies. Our primary, Allison, - she owns - her own clothing line. - Apparently she's - Instagram friends - With all of the other girls - that are involved, But they've never, ever met. - If you meet your friends on Instagram, you never say you met on Instagram. - Whoa, she's hot. - Wow. - It says they want - a beach picnic, by the way. - And they want a theme party based on social media. - Each meal, they could like or dislike. - I don't know about that. - Carley Faircloth loves escargot. The primary hates escargot. - Someone doesn't like seafood, others do like seafood, which makes it, you know, a little difficult if you're the chef. - I don't think they could - actually agree On one single plate. Hashtag "effing nightmare." - I'm gonna follow her - on Instagram - So I can go - on her next yacht trip. - Okay. - Become virtual friends - with her? - Like it all, yeah. - Where you guys at back here? - We're just drying now. - Do y'all need brushes, just need blades? - You don't need hoses - anymore or anything? - No, that's the only one - we need, right there... - Just make sure, when you're - done with any hose, drain it. - So, Lauren, have you ever - worked on a boat before? - Well, I have, actually. - Well, just in case - you didn't know, - I'm gonna tell you - how to do everything. - Please, do. [laughs] - So how are you feeling? - I'm mentally preparing for it. - Yeah, tomorrow, one of us - will go down vacuuming, - And then we have to fold - toilet paper and stuff. - Yeah, how would you - like the fold done? - Diamond with a fan. - Okay, yeah. - So are you dating anybody? - No, I've just... - On my previous boat, - I was in a relationship, But they're over now. - Are you dating anyone - at the moment? - I actually am. - Just only, like, - a month and a half. - So we're just in that - really happy phase. - How did you meet? - A bar in my hometown. - I had just come back - to the town. She had just come back to the town. - Oh, it's a she. - Yeah. - Oh, wow. - Yeah, it's my first time dating a girl, actually. - At first, I was like, I really - like hanging out with her, - But I don't want to give her - the wrong idea 'cause I'm not a lesbian. - But then, one night, - I kissed her. - I don't know - where it came from. - She just seems like - a really cool person. - I don't know - how to describe it. - It's like, I was never - in the closet. - I just kind of went - in the closet for a second, Picked out a new outfit, and came right back out. - But you've never felt - attracted to girls until now? - No, no, never. - All crew, dinner is ready. - Oh, this looks awesome. - It smells awesome. - Mmm! - How was your day? - Pretty busy? - A lot of exterior - on this boat. - Yeah, especially - for this size. - My old boat was - a lot bigger than this, And we only had five outside. - How big - was your last boat? - Uh, 67 meters. - That's big. - That's big. - Nico, I saw you trying - to take the top bunk. Sorry, I took the top bunk. - I went in there, - I was like, "No way." - I know you're tall, - but I'm the senior deckhand. - [laughs] - Are you serious right now? Bad start. All right, my coffin, here I go. - Good night. - Good night. - What's up, big guy? - Oh. F... - That is f... ed up. - So how are you feeling about our two-stew adventure? - We're just not gonna stop. - - The fact that Emily - is not freaking out About not having a third stew proves to me that she knows, in yachting, things happen you can't control, - and all you can do - is move forward. - I'm just gonna need you - to be my right hand. Like, I trust your judgment. - I can tell you know - what you're doing. - What's your Instagram name? - The World Wanderer. Sounds majestic, doesn't it? Hashtag "awesome." - Attention all crew, - charter guests - will be arriving in one hour. - Where's the spinach?
