 Pack your stuff  and leave the boat. - I think it'll be smoother without him. - Better be. So this is a one-day charter. They each have two daughters from previous marriages. - "Brady Bunch."  - On a family retreat... - Can I get another mojito,  please? - Mojito? Yeah, of course.  - Thank you. - As long as they have cocktails, they can do-- they don't care. - Coors Light. Killing it! - Kyle.  - Kelley. Nice to meet you. - I've been doing  offshore supplying,

 working on fishing trawlers  since then. - What?  - We're not in Kansas anymore. - No. - Get started on getting  the, uh, toys in. - We're already on it, Cap. - Ooh.  - F---! - You all right, Kyle?  Is he all right? What happened?  - You all right? - F---ing hell.  - Oh, my God. - Holy sh--. ¶ ¶ - Oh, man. - It's so good.  - Oh, it's so good. - Everything's good.  - So good. - Has anybody seen the pool?  It's gigantic. - Is he all right?  What happened? - You all right?  - F---ing hell. - Oh, my God.  - Holy sh--. Did he dislocate  his shoulder? Do you want us  to pop it back in? - Yeah, Lauren can. - It's completely come out  of the socket. To feel your muscles  and your tendons, like, move out of place,  it's so uncomfortable. And so I just have to, like,  click it back in. - You good?  - Yeah. First few times it hurts, but after it happens,  like, three, four times, yeah, you just  get on with it. Okay. - That was delicious. - Excited to go swimming? - Oh, yeah! - Hey, Kyle, hoop that  through that eyelet. We're gonna trade out lines. - They're so nice. - He seems like  a touch of class, right? - Yeah, he is. - Ooh, look at this cool--  f--- yeah. - It's time to get in the water. It's the same  as the air temperature. - That's Claire. Claire, get in the water, bro. - Yeah.  - Okay, cool. He's on his way. - Thank you.  - All right? All right, here we go. - Oh! - It's so windy for this now. - Yeah. - They're about to tip. - Oh!  Down! Down! Down! For f---'s sake. - You guys are over the reef. You all right?  - Yeah, I'll get them in, huh? I'll just keep us off the reef,  going astern. - We're gonna get you in the boat first, get you away from this reef. Just come to me! - There's a rock right here.  Back up. Back up. Back up. - All right. - Holy sh--! - Oh.  - Nico! - Hey. ¶ ¶ - Everything all right,  guys? - Yeah, just a bit shaken up, that's all. - All good?  - You okay? - Yeah.  - We're fine. - All right, one, two, three. - Are you all right? - Yeah.  - We're fine. - They're in--  they're in the boat now. - We good, girls?  - Yeah, totally. - Like, yeah,  you're all right now. We came 2 feet away  from knocking you out with the boat and killing you. - We'll put some vinegar on it. - I'm fine. - Oh, okay. - Wow, she's wounded! - I don't know. It just happened. It was fine. It was fine. - My charter guest  gets injured. It's always our fault. to take care of them, make sure they have  good, safe fun. - Just breathe.  - Thanks. - Kate, Kate.  Lee. - Ro? Babe? I lost you for, like,  a solid 30 seconds. - Em, Em.  Lee. ¶ ¶ Sierra, Sierra.  Lee. I get really pissed off when people  don't answer their radio. I'm not calling you  for my health. There's a reason  that I'm calling you. Do we have anybody on service? - Yeah, Sierra.  I'm on my break. - I can't--I can't find her.  - Kate's in her room. - No, I was busy  on the other... - They were turning,  and we're like, "Bye." - Sierra, do you have  your radio on? - I'm sorry. Whip up a batch  of Painkillers, and we'll deliver 'em to the aft deck.  - No problem. - Do you know how to do it?  - How many do we need? Yes.  - How many guests do we have? - For everyone?  - Yep. - Got it.  - Mm-kay? I mean, we're in the home  of the Painkiller. It's pretty much a staple  here in the Virgin Islands. I want to bring some levity  to the situation. - Do you need any help?  - No. - Are you sure?  - Yeah, I'm sure. - You guys almost died?  - Yeah. - The boat almost... - It was a near-death  experience. - I need a drink immediately. - Gonna put 'em  in a little container. - No, no.  Painkillers, the drink. - Oh, absolutely.  I'm so sorry. The pills... I didn't get  the Painkiller message. That's funny. ¶ ¶ - How you coming, kiddo?  - Good. - You worried  about the recipe? - Yeah, I haven't made  this many at one time. - Um, you're gonna need  more rum than this. Here, we got this, pilgrim. - Oh, okay. ¶ ¶ - Okay, go ahead  and run 'em out. - Thank you so much. - Whoo! - Are those Painkillers? - Thank you.  - You're welcome. - Yeah. ¶ ¶ - I think I'm gonna move us to something a little more calmer. - That would be nice. Then my crème brûlée will set level. - I'm gonna work on that  right now. Kelley, Kelley.  Lee. ¶ ¶ Kelley, Kelley.  Lee. ¶ ¶ Cheers! - Looking for Kelley, Cap?  - Yeah. And I'm wondering why nobody's answering their f---ing radios. - Um, I saw him in the crew mess. - Kelley, Kelley.  Lee. ¶ ¶ Let's get these in.  - Yeah. - Lauren, Lauren,  come in? - Go ahead. - Hey, do you mind coming out  and give us a hand? - Yeah, copy that. - You find him?  - Nope. ¶ ¶ Does anybody  have eyes on Kelley? - Yeah. Go for Kelley. - Where are ya? - Crew mess.  I was in the br--restroom. - Okay, keep your radio  with you when you go. I need the aft deck cleared  and all the stuff, all the toys put away. - Roger that.  On it now. Come on, Cap, I mean you're  up my ass and around a corner. Give me a little break here. - Headed up to wheelhouse now  and get ready to fire 'em off. - What's going on?  - We're moving 'cause it's too rocky.  The captain's worried about my crème brûlée  not setting level. - Did something happen  while I was on break? - Yeah, a couple of the guests  nearly died, but nothing serious. - Nico, Lauren,  to the bow, please. - Ready.   - Let's do this. - Do you want to give him  direction? - Yeah.  - We're just here. Hand signals are super important  when pulling the anchor because he needs to know  exactly where the anchor's at. Right there's good.  - Huh? - We're good. It's very important  that we pull it up straight, off the paint,  off the stainless. If it's leaning  all the way out, it can hit the prop and completely mess the boat up. A little bit that way. Yeah. - You guys look like  Moe, Larry, and Curly up there,  for crying out loud. - What's he saying? - Okay, tell him that it's, uh-- it's up and down right now. - Uh, it's up and down  right now, Captain. - My deck team right now  isn't performing up to the standards  that I expect. We're four charters  into the season. And I expect their game  to be sharp, and it's not there. - Anchor's in, Cap.  - Roger that, thank you. - Hey, we got to work on those hand signals, girl. ¶ ¶ - Yeah. - I'm a flirty person  in general, but there's definitely  some sexual tension between me and Emily. I can tell  by her body language. - Would you like a fresh one?  - Yep. - I'm happy to go back to Chardonnay, though. - Okay.  - Can I get a mimosa? - I'll have the same thing.  - I'll be right back. - Sierra. Like the phonetic alphabet,  isn't it? You know, Sierra,  Tango, Whiskey. - Oh, yeah.  - Yeah, yeah. Is it spelled S-I-E-R-R-A?  - Mm-hmm. - And what's your last name? - Storm. I understand, like, 89% of what comes out  of Kyle's mouth. - Sierra Storm?  - Yes. - Well, if a lady  carries that name, there's hurricanes  coming your way. - Kelley, Kelley.  Lee. - Captain Lee,  this is Kelley. - Kelley, I need some people  up here on the bow. We need to get this anchor  dropped and set. - Roger that. - They're properly sauced up now, right? - They're drinking at a rate that even impresses  and scares me. - Are they even gonna be around for dinner? Ro is so cute. - I'm seeing a lot of texting  back and forth with this Ro character. I really think she should  leave that on the dock and deal with the job at hand. ¶ ¶ - Two shots now. Two shots now. ¶ ¶ - Two shots in the water. - Good job. Oh, and I need  the waterline cleaned up on the boat today too. - Roger that.  On it now. - Whoa. Ro's coming to visit. - F---ing boat. - I know. I'm excited for Ro to meet Ben  so he can finally understand why I am so committed to staying in contact with her. Like, everyone loves Ro. - Is she really 6 feet tall? - She is. - Hi, what's up?  - Nothing. - Okay, so you want to hear  about ideas for the white dinner party?  - Hit me. - Theme parties are something  I really enjoy doing. It makes my job super fun, and I want them  to be as excited about this white party as I am. Can be like a white rabbit party. - "Alice in Wonderland" kind of.  - Like--yep. Yep. But like all--like...  - Yeah. - We can wear little bunny ears and little tails. - Yes, please.  Yes. - And we can make little hats.  - Okay. - You have five minutes left.  - I'm not gonna make it. This is too much. - Ah. "It will be fun." So Sierra? Huh, you're like,  "Oh, Sierra. Ugh" - Do you think she wants it, though? - She wants something. I have no clue how long  it'll take Kyle to figure out she is nuts. Mm, we'll see  how quick he learns. - What the f---  is a wellington? - Oh, no, no. - Coming up... - I've been looking  at dirty f---ing windows for three f---ing days.  - That's all inside. - Do you really want to go to war on this? - Would you like  more Chardonnay? - Oh, did I switch to liquor? - Oh, still have  the hic-em-ups? - Is that you, honey?  - Hic-em-up. - What's a "hic-em-up"? Hic-em-ups. - Why are you calling them that?  - I always call them that. - Hic-em-ups?  - Why do you care? - You've told me this  my whole life and I've never known  about it? - Maybe you have never listened  to me until this day right now. - Okay. - How are the guests? - They're pretty drunk. Killing it. - I wouldn't be surprised if they took naps. 'Cause they're on California time. - They're not gonna f---ing  make it, are they? - They're gonna make it, Ben.  We're all gonna make it. - Mm.  - Oh. Well, what time do you  want to do dinner then? - I don't know, 8:00? - 30? - What do you think? Should we ask them? - I really don't think  they'll notice or care. - I could sleep here.  - Yeah, I know. I could take a nap.  - You got champagne? - Yeah, for fun, dude.  We're on a f---ing boat. - All right, ready?  - One, three, two. - Oh, my God, Kelley! Oh, that was like Red Bull and Chinese food. - You can taste that. That's proper thick,  that one, isn't it? You can put that  on a plate and eat it. - Gross.  - Hey. - Me and Kyle are  hitting it off pretty good. I'm not sure about  Nico and Lauren, but they have their own  little, like, group. And I was outside of that group. I mean to a certain extent. I am their boss, but I still like to be buddy-buddy. Do you need a medic?  - You need a medic. After that f---ing hell. You know what would be really interesting? Is if I took an Ambien before dinner. - Yeah. - Would be an interesting night, though, right? - Yep. ¶ ¶ - I'm sorry to interrupt your texting, but, you know. ¶ ¶ - Who? Sierra?  - Mm-hmm. - I'm not 12 years old. - Okay, that's my cue. - I'm gonna put  the groundwork in. It's like building a house. - God, Sierra, Kyle thinks  you're drop-dead gorgeous. Like, he's, like,  obsessed with you. - Really?  - Yeah. Girl.  - Flattered. In yachting, a lot of guys kind of act the same. They look the same. - Sierra?  - Hmm? - Um, do you have any combs?  - Mm-hmm. So it's refreshing  when you meet a guy that's  a little different, a little bit more rugged. - Thank you very much, Sierra.  - Oh, you're welcome. ¶ ¶ - There's kind of  a pause now because the guests  passed out. - Have you seen anyone dwindling  or anything like that? - No, but I think  9:00 is great. - Yeah. Uh... - In Ben's world, I should be  telling the guests what time to eat. Hi.  - That's so awesome. - Okay, can you help me  carry these? We're gonna--  - Yeah. - Yeah. In my world,  we should let them enjoy their brief, expensive vacation and be on hand  like the luxury crew we're trained to be. ¶ ¶ - This is killer. - The what?  - Check wax, black marks. That's been done. - Black marks, wax black marks. - Oh, sorry. - I feel like I have to translate. I know what he's saying. - I wonder if we'll turn him  a little American and he'll turn us  a little British. - Ooh, God, I hope you don't turn him American. Ugh, none of that.  - I'll come home back to Manchester with stars and stripes like that. All right. "Hey, man." - 'Sup, Cap?  - Um... Kelley's been down  this road before, so he knows what I expect. He should be doing it  bigger, better, faster, with more enthusiasm  than anybody else. - Once you finish eating,  change over. - It's still a work day,  so you're still on the clock. - What is this fancy stuff? "Claire, follow the white rabbit  to the white party. Dinner at 9:00 p.m."  Ooh. ¶ ¶ - Good evening. How are you?  - Good. - Good. - Absolutely. Thank you.  - Perfect. Something to drink?  - Yes. - Sure. - All right. Will you pour Heidi  a Chardonnay and make him a Painkiller? - Yes.  - Ben. Do you want to come discuss  dinner with me real quick? - Dinner at 9:00.  - Mm-hmm, I heard. - In half an hour.  - Yep. - Yeah, we can have a chat about it now that I know what's going on.  - I'm just--I'm--oh, really? - Yeah. - You're preparing food for them at 9:00.  - Yeah, that's right. - Right, I thought that  was always the idea. - Huh?  - That was always the idea. I think 9:00 is great.  - Yeah. Kate, it's quite easy; you just have to ask the question. - What is your problem  at this moment? - I wanted that three hours ago, Kate. Three hours ago, I wanted that answer. - Do you think that if...  - But instead, you didn't do anything...  - That answer-- I'm not done talking.  When I went up there-- - For me, that's-- you're just buying time and wasting more of my time. - That's because you're insecure and paranoid; I'm not-- - Insecure? No, I just want direction with my job... - Okay.  - If that's okay. - I don't want to hear it. - I don't have time to be texting my girlfriend all day, okay? I don't have time to go and have a nap or send the others to have a nap. I don't have two minions under me doing everything I don't want to do. I don't have these luxuries. ¶ ¶ - That is so cute. - Party time. ¶ ¶ - Hi, girls, you look adorable.  - I love it. - Ben, so you're  pretty much ready, right? - Kate, give me a damn break. - Whatever. ¶ ¶ - Oh, that looks fabulous. - Wow! - Wow. - Beautiful.  Everything's great. - The guests  are at the table, Ben. - You're trying to rush me and freak me out. - Isn't it so fun? - Totally, I agree. - It isn't.  - It's never too late. - When I'm in times of stress, having these slapstick  sound bites in my ear... - Is not really helping me. It's f---ing annoying. - Emily, will you follow me  with the salmon tartare? - Uh, tuna.  - Tuna, sorry. - Hey, you need to take the rice first. Also, the--the sabut needs to go first, as well. I mean, come on. Who the hell's going out--  no, no, put it on the tray. - To start, we have jalapeño salmon... - Oh, man.  - And tuna tartare. - Thank you.  - That rice is huge. - Holy sh--.  - There's rice for days. - Beautiful.  - Oh. - It's hella good.  - Oh, man. - Seared duck breast with soy pearls. - It's so good! It's so good.  - So good. - It's really good. - Service, s'il vous plaît. - Here we have  sashimi of scallop... - Wow.  - With trout roe and jalapeño. - When did you make  all this food, Ben? - I don't know. I guess I've been blacked out for the last three hours. - We'll do, um--we can make  some simple syrup real quick. Stop it. Ben, I'm cleared  - Okay. So vanilla crème brûlée, chocolate cigar, whipped cream. F---. - This is the best thing  ever in my life. - Yes. - Oh, she's texting  every minute. That's not a distraction  at all. Now.  Three minutes ago. I don't know about this  Ro character. - Coming up... - What the hell was that about?  Why wouldn't you be like, "Well, there's a chance that--  because Lauren has no experience..."  - Because she wants-- he wanted to see it.  - You can't have my back. - Don't tell me  I don't have your back. ¶ ¶ - Hey, we just need to,  around Captain, just make sure  we're staying busy. Stay out of the crew mess.  He's on us for some reason. I think he's just  a little bored at the moment. - That was delicious.  - Kids, go in the hot tub. - Yeah. - Y'all two, go down.  - Thanks, man. Appreciate that. - We need bathing suits. ¶ ¶ - Yes. - Kelley embraces the  opportunity to be topless. It--it's not something that  excites me, to be honest. - You too. - I mean, they have to pass out  at some point, right? - Right? Yeah. - If they order  any more Irish coffees, use the red decaf.  - I have been. - Let's--do not give them more caffeine. - I wish I had some Baileys and coffee. Like, that's way better, ooh. - That's it.  Thank you for a good night. - Okay. Yeah. Thank you. - We're going to bed. - Hi.  - Hi. - How are you? - Yep. In the past, I didn't ever contact the people I was dating because I wasn't actually  that into them. So I warned Ro that I might not  have time to chat with her, but now I feel  like I can make time. And I've never made time  for anybody before on land. - Brenden. - Brenden. - Brennen.  - Brennen. - "Was"? - Oh, that's too bad. - Oh. - Who's not upset? - I'm just trying  to be supportive. I'm actually really pissed. - Mm-kay, bye. - I don't know which one's mine. - This one.  - Okay. - You...  - Okay, bye. ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ - Hello. Good morning. - Wow. Look how salty everything is. - Mmm. Yeah. - I've had one person up  since I've been up. I've been looking  at dirty f---ing windows for three f---ing days. I'll go chew on somebody's ass. ¶ ¶ - No. - What? - I thought it was a new box,  and it's not. - Emily's got amazing energy. I enjoy her English company. Don't worry about it. - Kelley, Kelley.  Lee. - For Kelley.   - Yeah, can I see you in the bridge for a second? - Coming up now. - If Kelley doesn't  start performing the way I think he should, I'll probably just end up  having to babysit him all the way through the season. - 'Sup, Cap? - You and I both look out the same windows, and we see the same dirt. And I'm wondering how come nobody's taken care of it. Lauren's been up since 6:30 and yet hasn't touched anything. - Um... I want to show you this.  - Okay. - That's all inside.  - Okay. - That's--that's a Kate issue.  - But it's--it's still there. - We're not inside.  That's interior, Captain. - I didn't-- Well, okay. Fine. Go downstairs and tell me that salt is on the f---ing inside. - No, that--that's--okay.  - That's right. And it's been there for two f---ing days. - I feel like we get called out  on a lot of things, and you don't always  call Kate out on it. - Do you really want to go to war on this? - I don't. I was just-- - We can. I got no issues with it. - No, I was just  trying to point out, it seems like we're  getting picked on... - You think there's a double standard? You're getting picked on? Come here, let's go look at it. - No, I believe you, Cap.  - No, come. - Okay.  - Let's go. In Kelley's situation,  he's given a second shot at redemption;  he should be stepping forward, front and center and going,  "Sorry about that, Cap. I'll get on it.  Won't happen again." Not this wallowing in self-pity. Two days, it's been like that. Just to show you that  it's not on the inside. - Okay.  - Are we clear? - Yep, we're clear.  - Good. I want it done.  - Roger that. - So what is your person that's been up been doing? - I'll deal with it. He won't pick on Kate.  He won't mess with the stews. He's terrified of Kate, and  it makes my job more difficult because then he just  comes after me. - Drop off day.  - Drop off day. - Dude, let's smash it out. Let's try to be done, by, like-- - Hey, guys, before we get  underway, let's go ahead and hit the windows once  all the way around. - What was that?  - Windows. - Copy that, Kell.  - All the windows. - All the windows. ¶ ¶ - Go double-check  those windows down there. - Can't go out  without sunglasses. - Sorry. Spray in your face.  - No, no, that's all right. Been sprayed in the face before. - Morning. Hello. - Coffee.  May as well get two of 'em. - How was the rest  of last night? - It was really fun.  - Good. - Good?  - Yeah. - Should we go ahead  with breakfast now, or do you want  to wait till 10:00? I've really got  to give it to them. If I had drunk the quantity  that they had yesterday, then I don't think I'd be seeing  the light of day for a good few days. - All guests up. - Still warm.  Cool. - A piece of bacon? - Would you like some blueberry pancakes? - Sure.  - Are they happy? - They are.  They seem very content. - Not much. - Um, good. Oh, how am I doing my hair? - Yeah, yeah, 'cause if we  get married, I need to know. - Oh.  - I need to know these things. - It's probably gonna change every day. - Okay, fine.  I see--I see how it goes. - I want Lauren running the point on anchor today and you and Nico up here. I'm trying to get you to look at things differently than you ever had before. Because now you are a department head, you are in a position where you have authority. I just want you to get an idea of my frustration. Kelley's deck crew isn't  living up to expectations. So I want him  to take notice of that. I want him to see what I see. - Uh, you're gonna be doing  the anchor today. You're just gonna pull it up  on your own. - All right.  - Knock it out of the park. - Engage steering. - It's a bit stressful that I haven't done it  by myself before. Every time we do the anchor, there's always  two people doing it. - Okay, Lauren, let's  get us out of here. - Copy that.  Lifting up now. But for some reason, I've been called  to come up by myself. It just doesn't make sense  at all. - I'm not sure what the  little finger wiggles are. Maybe she just likes the breeze. And I don't know  what that means. - Anchor's off the bottom. - We had three shots out. Anchor should not be  off the bottom. - All right. - She has no clue  where her hand is. - It's hard for me to watch because she's getting  everything wrong. I want to just run down there  and just tell her to, like, do this and do that,  and he's not having it. - Anchor's now  off the bottom, Cap. - Are we sure about that  this time? - Anchor's home and secured. - Just a learning experience. And then maybe next time  on the next charter, I'll get her and them up here. And then you guys  can go out there and do it all wrong so that she can get an idea  of exactly what she's been doing. Oy, oy, oy. I'm really pissed off. Such f---ing bullsh--. I was just completely  thrown under the bus. What the hell was that about? - Captain called us in the  bridge, he wanted us to watch. - There's always been two people there. Yes, Captain now wants one person. Regardless, I have no experience up there. Why wouldn't you be like, "Well, there's a chance that because Lauren has no experience that she might screw it up"? - Because she wants--  he wanted to see it. Once he makes up his mind,  I can't really change it. - You can't have my back? You can't be like-- - Don't tell me I don't have  your back because I just got into it this morning with him  yelling in my face about you. - Coming up... - Who the f--- is that?  What? Shut up. - Oh, my God! - You can't have my back? You can't be like-- - Don't tell me I don't have  your back because I just got into it this morning with him  yelling in my face about you. - What have I done now? Why is Captain pissed at me? - Nothing, he said you weren't  doing anything this morning. And I fought back on it. I haven't let  sh-- roll downhill. I've kept y'all happy  and enjoying your time while I've been  taking all the sh--. I have your back.  I have it no matter what. And you walk away.  Dude, the thing is, is like-- - I'm just really upset  right now. - No, I show you respect--  yeah, you're upset and I'm telling you not to be. I have f---ed up with the Captain so many times on this thing. Do not let it get to you. I'm telling you right now.  Come here. F---ing come here. It's okay. It's not worth it. - Captain seems to be  really on Kelley's ass, and Kelley's on our ass, but  we're all still working hard. We're all getting the job done, so I don't know  why he's being difficult. - It's gonna okay,  all right? - I feel like  Jay Z and Beyoncé. I'm Beyoncé.  - I'm Jay Z. Oh, my gosh. - He's Blue Ivy. ¶ ¶ - He's the one who  jumped in the water, right? And rescued us?  - Nico? - Uh-huh, 'cause we almost got straight murked. - I'm barely gonna have  enough room to swing. - Nice, how you looking  on the stern? - Yeah, we're looking good.  Uh, we're pulling tight on it. Put the eyelet way up there. - We can shut 'em down. - That went a bit smoother  than I thought it would go. - Sh--.  - What? - Did he?  - Yeah. - Can we take that, sir?  I'm staying out of it. All right?  - Yeah. - All crew, all crew, I need everybody on the aft deck in your dress clothes in ten. - How did this fit in here  when I packed it originally? - Is it too late for a mimosa? Or too early for a cocktail? - Ready, set, go. - Safe travels. Thank you guys.  - Nice to meet you guys. - Safe travels.  - Hope you had a great trip. - Nice meeting you.  - Bye-bye. - Bye. Nice meeting you.  - Enjoyed it, sir. - Bye. You guys were lovely.  - Thank you. - Well, we had a great time. - Hope you did, Marc. - Everything was fabulous. Nico, thank you for showing your true valor and saving the girls. They call me Valorman. F--- Superman. - We had a wonderful time.  - Thank you so much. Thank you.  - Bye, guys. Bye. - Okay. We got a boat to flip. Attention all crew, I need everybody in the crew mess directly. Number four, in the books. Nico, you did a nice job with the girls. - Thank you. - You did the right thing jumping in. Kyle, take your hat off. You're inside. - Sorry, sir. - It was good having you on board. It made a big difference on the deck, I'm sure. We had some hiccups. Radios still are a pet peeve of mine. I don't care what you're doing. Everybody better have their frigging radio with them. That just really wrinkles my ass to no end. Really don't want to keep going over that again. So we got 15 grand. - Ha-ha. - Comes out to $1,350 apiece. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Kate. - This one-day charter was like  a really good one-night stand. Sure, it started  with some bumps and bruises, but in the end,  there was a really big tip. - Oh, I had a surprise. It's one of those "good news, bad news" things. - Bad news first. - The slide's here. - Yay.  - Oh. - And it will be on board for the next charter. Uh, the good news is, I called up a friend of mine, while we're at Scrub Island and arranged for you guys to have a resort to yourselves tomorrow. - Oh. - What?  - Oh, yeah. Thank you, God. Let's just not  think about work, not think about any drama  going on with the boat. Let's just have a nice day  and enjoy ourselves. - Please honor my wishes this evening. Do not go off the boat, okay? Tomorrow, if you want to crawl in a bottle of rum, I don't care. But the next day after that, we're working hard. - Roger that. - We're doing a wash-down,  getting all the dirt off, all the salt off,  just double-check 'em all, make sure they're perfect. ¶ ¶ - So we don't work  at all tomorrow? - Yeah! ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ - Oh! Oh! - Work those tris. - This is the  "I don't know" rep. "Do I know?  I don't know." - All right, kids, let's go. ¶ ¶ - How are you doing, baby? You get a nice sleep? - Yeah, I took an Ambien,  and in the middle of the night I walked out, got a Diet Coke  and a can of Pringles. - Whew. - Ready?  - Yeah, I'm going on the dock. - Who the f--- is that? What?  Shut up. - Hi. - I think Ambien should be  more of a daytime drug. Like, recreational.  - I have it in my purse. - Hey, guys. Where's Kate? - Um... - Oh, my God, it's you. - Where is she?  - I was gonna say... - Hey. How's it going?  - "I've seen you before." - This is Nico; he's  super cool; he's super young. - Don't worry.  I'm only 22, so... She's super attractive, Spanish.  That's hot, like... Professional football player. She--like--  why are you a lesbian? Hey, Kate!  - Yeah? - Come here for a second. I got to talk to you  about something. - What?  - It's really important. - What? Oh, my God! - Surprise! - Oh, my God! I knew you were lying.  You're so full of sh--. - Hi, babe.  - Hi. - Hi. Hi, baby.  - Hi. I've never been this close  to a panic attack in my life. I'm happy,  but I'm also freaking out because I would have liked to spent more time with my hair. I'm getting out. I don't want to get out. Like, you can--  you can--you can keep-- Are you guys coming?  No? No?  Okay? - Oh. Coming up... - Oh, my God, Ben is, like, hating his life right now. - You want a martini?  - Cosmo. ¶ ¶ Very strong. - Whoa. Ben. - Did you just see  who walked on board? - I did. - Ro knows that Kate and I  have had a history. - Hi.  - Hi. - Yeah, I'm obviously  a little bit nervous, but that's natural, right? You'd be weird if you weren't gonna be a tiny bit nervous. - So you want to see the rest of the boat? - Oh, yeah. - I'm not usually a person  who does a lot of PDA. The master bathroom. But... - Disappointing.  - It's super light. - I just can't help it. And I don't really care. - She's, like,  super f---ing fine. - Yeah, she was pretty hot.  - I'd be a lesbian too. - If I was a lesbian,  I'd do her. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Uh-huh.  That's the master bathroom. - Uhh, would I be  wasting time with Emily? - I don't think you're  her type, per se. I think you're just, like,  too, like, older, more, like, macho  than she's used to. I mean, I would give it a go. - Do some more reconnaissance for me, a little bit. I haven't been pushing  anything. - Yeah. - Should we wait inside  for them? - Yeah. - This is Ben's area.  - Yeah. - I can't wait to meet Ben. - Hey, guys,  this is Ro. - Hi, Ro. - I'm Ben.  - What's up, Ben? - How's it going?  - Very nice to meet you all. - I didn't expect you  to be so tall. - Hey, I'm Lauren. nice to meet you. - I am super tall. - Ro is in the Caribbean. And she's wearing dark  on dark on dark. Looks like she  just crawled out of a fallout shelter in Moscow. Yeah. - I miss you. - Good morning. - All right, kids, let's go. - Arriba, arriba. - Good-bye, Tortola.  - Cheers. - Whoo! ¶ ¶ You know, sometimes  you never know until you see someone  with someone else. Like, my ex-boyfriend, he's,  like, obsessed with me now. I'm like, "Where is this  coming from? - They have been. - Ha, a little?  - A lot. - Surprise. Oh, my God. - I was just like... - With any one of the guys,  that'd be true, if they just came up to me...  - And asked you on a date? - And asked me out, I'd say...  - You'd probably go. - I would go--but...  - Yeah. - Ugh!  Look at that water. - I'm excited to have a nice crew bonding day together. - So this is Scrub Island? - Most of us  got into this industry so we can travel  and see new places, so... I've heard that Scrub Island  is amazing, so super, super pumped. - Is that a trampoline  in the water? That's pretty epic. - This is gonna be so much fun. ¶ ¶ - I like my girls tiny. Spin you around, twirl you. I like to feel, like, this tiny,  little thing in my arms, like, "Oh, I'm gonna protect you.  I'll be your man. It's okay." - You know Deborah's style, right? - Yeah, Deborah.  - Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. What's up, Ben? - Good, Ro, it's lovely  to see you, lovely to meet you. - Finally, right?  - Yeah, I know. I hear that laugh radiating through  the boat at night. - Yeah. - So it's kind of funny to have, like, physicality.  - Yeah? - Voice to a face.  - Yeah. - I mean, I hear you, like, always on speaker. - We both have laughs,  like, big laughs. - 'Cause that's why I feel like I know him already. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's good times. - You know? You're cute. ¶ ¶ - They seem very affectionate  with one another. ¶ ¶ - Priorities. Handled. - It's great. It's awesome. - You want a martini? - Cosmo. Very strong. - Oh, my God, Ben is, like, hating his life right now. - When I first met Kate, I didn't have a clue  about her sexuality. - Mmm. - But she's just  doing her thing. And that's beautiful.  It's a nice thing. ¶ ¶ - What are you drinking? - Sea breeze.  - Dangerous. - Can you get my back? I try to play shy like,  "No, really, no." And, uh, yeah,  I'll eat it up all day long. This is like a proper massage  while I get sunscreen. Kelley. Kelley's definitely flirting,  in his way, with me. He's very sweet, but I'm finding  it slightly too touchy-feely. - I'm okay. - Now that I've screwed up  with Emily... Kelley's trying to, like,  step up his game. And I get it. - I think we need  to spice things up. Sorry. - It's all small signals,  like, how you look at 'em,  how you smile at 'em. Give 'em little touches  here and there. And I'm gonna sweep her  off her feet and she's not gonna know  what f---ing hit her. Coming up... - You do realize, though, that I find you very attractive? You're stunning. Absolutely beautiful. - Cheers. Cheers. - I'm retired.  - I'll give you the cheer. Ready? Let's go. - Like, I have a lot  of respect for fishermen. Jesus was a fisherman.  - Jesus was a carpenter. - I know he was a carpenter,  but he taught a man to fish. - He didn't teach  a man to fish at all. - He did.  - No, he fed the 5,000. - Well, I mean, he turned loaves into fish. - No, he turned the fish  into multiple amounts of fish. - Okay, Catholic school, like eight years. - Yeah, yeah,  I'm Catholic as well. And you're f---ing wrong.  He made the bread, more... - I said loaves into fish. - No, he didn't turn  the loaves into fish. Turned the loaves into  more bread and he turned... - Yeah.  - The fish into more fish. Sierra, as a person,  she's f---ing out there. Absolute loopy. Fruit loop.  A bit mental. - That's cool. You're Catholic; I'm Catholic. - Are we?  - Uh-huh. - So practically,  we're married. I understand that I could end up  with a knife in my chest. You do realize, though, that I find you very attractive? You're stunning. Absolutely beautiful. - Think I'm cool? - So what's that? It's like, okay, you're cool, but-- You're nice.  - Thank you. - Kyle's a romantic. I mean, he's like  the British version of me that talks more, but Sierra's a lunatic, like "she'll take your dick off  with a butter knife in the middle of the night"  crazy. ¶ ¶ - Thanks, babe.  - Yep. Go find some shade? Come on. Pick it up, center fielder. ¶ ¶ Ro's a retired  professional athlete. But she still has the same commitment to physical endurance  and excellence... Which is respectable. - I need to cool off. - Next on "Below Deck"... - Happy Valentine's Day. I don't have a valentine, no. - We might have to change that.  - Aw. - I think she thinks  I'm a muscle-head. - Love is in the air. ¶ ¶ - Okay, yeah.  That'd be cool. - I have a flower order coming. You want me to add? ¶ ¶ - Try to keep in your mind to be a little bit more proactive. - Pool's going in  and the Seabobs are going in. We're gonna be proactive. - What are you doing?  This is f---ing embarrassing. - Are you guys ready for us yet, or no? - I'm on my way down. We really don't look like  seasoned professionals. It's not that goddamn tough.
