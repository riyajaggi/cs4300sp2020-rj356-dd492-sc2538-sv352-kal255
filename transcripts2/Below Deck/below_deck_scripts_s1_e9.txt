 KAT, CHECK THE DOOR ONE MORE TIME. KAT, COME WITH ME. - I JUST WANT TO STRANGLE HER AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT. - I NEED YOU TO BE WORKING RIGHT NOW. - I'VE BEEN [bleep] WORKING ALL DAY. - I UNDERSTAND. WE'RE NOT DONE YET. - I WANT TO VERY, VERY BADLY SHOVE THE PITCHFORK UP ADRIENNE'S ASS. - I THINK BEN IS PROBABLY CLOSEST TO ME. I THINK HE'S HYSTERICAL.

 [alarm beeping] - SAM. - WHAT'S UP? - ALL CREW, ALL CREW. - THE MISTAKES THAT YOU'RE MAKING COULD BE FATAL. I GOT TO HAVE A FIRST OFFICER I CAN COUNT ON. - I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST. - TO CAPTAIN DIP[bleep]. - WHEN WE'RE ON CHARTER, YOU DON'T DRINK. - KAT WANTS TO GO TO THE BAR. - KAT'S BEEN DRINKING. THAT'S NOT TOO TOUGH TO FIGURE OUT. - I'M CONCERNED THAT SHE'S GONNA LOSE HER JOB. - WHEN YOU DRINK, YOU TURN INTO A TRAILER PARK DEMONIC REFUGEE. - OW! [grunts] - IF I SEE YOU SINKING ONE MORE TIME, YOU'RE DONE. SO IF YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR IT, TOUGH [bleep]. - I'M NOT TOO GOOD FOR IT. - STOP. PUT A [bleep] LID ON IT. I AM UP TO HERE WITH YOU. - HEY, GUYS. - LET'S DRINK. - I FIND PEOPLE ATTRACTIVE THAT ARE OUTGOING AND ATHLETIC. - YES. - I'M LIVING IN A CABIN WITH ANOTHER GIRL. - THEN YOU SHOULD BE [bleep] HER. - I'VE BEEN HIT BY A BUS FULL OF VODKA, AND IT'S MADE ME DO BAD THINGS. [both laughing] - ARE YOU GUYS HAVING FUN? - WE ARE. THERE WAS JUST, LIKE, RAGE IN HIS EYES. - IT'S OKAY TO DRINK ON CHARTER? - IT'S NOT OKAY TO DRINK ON CHARTER. - ADRIENNE'S BEEN COMING TO ME LEFT AND RIGHT, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO GET ADVICE, LIKE, WITH SAM. "SHE'S SO ARROGANT AND SO STUBBORN, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH," AND I FINALLY SEE THAT. CJ AND SAM DECIDED TO GO SWIMMING OFF THE BOW. THEY HAD A BEER IN THEIR HAND. I WAS THINKING OF DOCKING THEIR PAY. SO YOU CAN TAKE THE $500 AND WALK OR YOU CAN TAKE 300, PUT THE REST IN THE KITTY, AND STAY FOR THIS LAST CHARTER. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - WE'VE GOT SIX. - LEE'S NOT COMING TO THIS MEETING. - WOW. - EDDIE, NASH. - YOU MISSED ME, BY THE WAY. - AND ME. - YEAH, I'M GONNA GET TO THAT. YOU GUYS KNOW LEE'S STANCE ON DRINKING ON CHARTER. BASICALLY, WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS. YOU CAN TAKE THE $500 AND WALK, OR YOU CAN TAKE 300, PUT THE REST IN THE KITTY, AND STAY FOR THIS LAST CHARTER. - I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU, ALEKS. I AM JUST GETTING SICK AND TIRED OF LEE. - OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE AN EASY TARGET RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW? I THINK THAT'S A LOT TO DO WITH IT. AND YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY DRINKING IN PUBLIC IS NOT A GOOD THING, YOU KNOW? - I THINK IT'S DRINKING ON CHARTER, NOT DRINKING IN PUBLIC. - WELL, BOTH. - IN PUBLIC ON CHARTER. - WELL, I'M NOT GONNA NAME NAMES, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S EVER BEEN GUILTY OF THAT. - WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO CUT MY PAY BY ALMOST HALF BECAUSE I HAD A BEER? 'CAUSE THAT IS COMPLETE BULL[bleep]. - WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, YOU GUYS HAVE AN OPTION FROM LEE THAT YOU CAN TAKE 500 AND WALK IF YOU WANT, OR YOU CAN TAKE 300-- - THIS IS WHY THIS BOAT HAS MORE TURNOVER THAN A BAD RESTAURANT, BECAUSE OF HIM. - IT--THAT'S [bleep]. THAT IS COMPLETELY [bleep]. - AND THAT'S AGAINST WHAT HE SAID TOO. HE SAID IF YOU DECIDE TO QUIT, YOU GET YOUR TIP, AND YOU LEAVE. - THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. YOU GUYS ARE MISSING THE POINT. - I CAN TAKE 300 AND STAY, OR I CAN TAKE 500 AND GO. - NO, NO, HE DIDN'T SAY THAT. HE SAID GIVE THEM THE TIP, LET THEM GO. - OH, SO THAT'S WHAT YOU NEGOTIATED WITH HIM. - GREAT IDEA, ALEKS. - ARE YOU NOT LISTENING? THE CAPTAIN WANTS TO FIRE YOU GUYS. AND ALEKS JUST SAVED YOUR JOBS BY GIVING YOU-- - WHAT DOES HE WANT TO FIRE US FOR? - BECAUSE YOU DRANK ON CHARTER. - HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT, RIGHT, ALEKS? HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT. - YES, HE DOES KNOW THAT. - YOU'RE THE ONLY EYES. YOU ARE THE ONLY EYES WHO SAW ME WITH A BEER IN MY HAND. - NOT TRUE. - NOT TRUE. - WHATEVER. [laughs] - YOU CAN GIVE ME ALL THE ATTITUDE YOU WANT. I TRY TO HELP YOU GUYS OUT. IS THIS THAT THANKS I GET? IT'S NO BIG DEAL. I'M NOT GONNA TAKE OFFENSE TO IT. - I'M NOT QUITTING, ALL RIGHT? GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOUR [bleep] $200 FROM MY TIP. - THE ULTIMATE LINE HERE IS THAT YOU KNEW WHAT THE RULES WERE, YOU WENT AGAINST THEM... - I JUST THINK THIS IS... - END OF STORY. - COMPLETELY THE WRONG WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. AND, LIKE, IF YOU THINK MY ATTITUDE'S GONNA BE BETTER ON THIS LAST TRIP BECAUSE MY TIP'S BEEN CUT IN HALF FOR HAVING A BEER, THEN-- - I NEED AN HOUR TO DECIDE WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE, PEOPLE. - IS THE MONEY REALLY THAT IMPORTANT? - I MEAN, YEAH, WHEN I JUST BUSTED MY ASS FOR THREE DAYS AND GOT A BULL[bleep] 5% TIP, AND NOW IT'S TURNING INTO A 2% TIP? NO, EDDIE, ABSOLUTELY NOT. - NO, NO. 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU [bleep] COMPLAINING ANYMORE. I'M TIRED OF EVERYBODY [bleep] COMPLAINING. WE GOT A GODDAMN JOB TO DO. LET'S [bleep] GET IT DONE! I DON'T GIVE A [bleep] IF I HAVE $200 EXTRA. I'M GONNA GET A JOB DONE. - THE JOB IS ABOUT THE MONEY. DO YOU THINK I'M HERE FOR FUN? DOES THIS SEEM LIKE FUN? IT'S JUST-- - WE HAVE ONE MORE TRIP. - YEAH, NO KIDDING, AND THEN I'M SO [bleep] OUT OF HERE. IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY. YOU KNOW? WELL, I'M NOT GONNA JUST [bleep] PACK MY BAGS, LIKE, YOU KNOW, SO-- - LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING TO BEAT YOU UP. I'M--YOU GUYS ARE MISSING THE POINT THAT-- - COULD YOU MOVE? GREAT, THANKS. - THAT WAS VERY MATURE. THEY'RE MISSING THE POINT. - THE POINT THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED. - YEAH. - [sighs] - SO, UH--SO READY FOR IT TO BE OVER. IT'S COMPLETELY [bleep], THE WHOLE THING. SAM. - SAM. - GOOD TO MEET YOU, GREG. OH, WE HAVE ONE MORE CHARTER. I'M UPSET THAT ALEKS HAS GIVEN US THIS STUPID ULTIMATUM THAT I'M NOT WILLING TO TAKE EITHER OPTION OF. AND THIS GUY GREG HAS THIS GORGEOUS SAILBOAT AND SAYS HE'S SHIPPING OUT IN AN HOUR AND INVITES ME TO COME WITH HIM, SO... HEAVILY CONSIDERING IT. - YOU COULD DO IT. - I'VE BEEN OFFERED TO HOP SHIP AND GO TO NEWPORT TOMORROW. - DO IT. THAT'S-- - OR TODAY. - TODAY, NOW. - TODAY, RIGHT NOW. - DO IT. - RIGHT? - DO IT. - HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK-- - THAT'S HOW I-- THAT'S HOW I'VE GOTTEN, LIKE-- THAT'S HOW I HAVE GOTTEN EVERYTHING I'VE GOTTEN IN THIS INDUSTRY. I'M SORT OF TORN BETWEEN THE YACHTIE WORLD AND THE CRUISER WORLD. I'D MUCH RATHER JUMP ON A 50-FOOT SAILBOAT WITH A COUPLE OF FRIENDS AND JUST SAIL OFF, LOOKING FOR SOME GOOD FISHING AND SURF. - I RECKON IT'D TAKE ABOUT TEN MINUTES. - NO, TO PACK ALL OUR ST-- PROBABLY, I COULD DO IT IN AN HOUR. ALL THESE YACHTIES WITH THEIR TIGHT KHAKIS ON THESE BIG WHITE BOATS NEED TO TAKE A PAGE FROM MY BOOK. - OH, MAN, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. HE MIGHT ACTUALLY DO IT. ALL RIGHT, GREG, WELL, SIR, IT WAS A PLEASURE TALKING TO YOU. - WHAT'S GOING ON? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, I'M GOOD. - WHAT HAPPENED? - I'M OUT. - WHAT? - I'M OUT. - WHAT THE [bleep] ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - I'M DELIVERING THAT CATAMARAN TO RHODE ISLAND. WE'RE LEAVING IN 20 MINUTES. - BULL[bleep]. - I LOVE YOU, AND WE'RE GONNA BE FRIENDS FOR LIFE. BUT THE NEXT FRICKING WEEK, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, AND I'M JUST SICK OF-- - ARE YOU GETTING A LOAD OF THIS? HE'S GETTING ON A CATAMARAN TO NEWPORT RIGHT NOW, RHODE ISLAND. - HEY, BEN. - WHAT? - ALL OF YOUR EGGS ARE RIGHT HERE. - YEAH, THAT'S FINE. WE'VE GOT CJ, WHO'S LEAVING THE BOAT NOW. IT'S A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT. I CAN TELL THERE IS NO TALKING HIM OUT OF THIS ONE. DUDE, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. - I KNOW. - THERE'S A BIG PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO TAKE HIM AND GO, "COME ON," TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM. - DO THEY PUT YOU ON A CREW LIST OR ANYTHING? - EXCUSE ME. - YEP. - HEY. - HEY. - CAN I HAVE A MOMENT? - SURE. HERE. - WELL, WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW? I'M GONNA BE ALL ALONE. UM-- - OH, HERE WE GO. - CJ. - YES? WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NEVER GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN. - WELL, YOU ARE LEAVING ON SOME WEIRD SHIP WITH A BUNCH OF STRANGERS TO GO TO RHODE ISLAND. - AT THIS POINT, I'VE ALREADY MADE UP MY MIND. - IS THERE ANYTHING I COULD SAY? - NO. ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING THINGS ABOUT THIS IS THAT I AM NOT GONNA GET TO HANG OUT WITH YOU ANYMORE. OH, [bleep], I HAD A PRESENT FOR YOU. OH, HERE IT IS. - YOUR FLAME SHIRT. - YEAH. FOR MY FRIEND, THE FLAME. - THAT'S WONDERFUL. THANKS. I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WANTS TO LEAVE, BECAUSE I HAVE THE SAME FEELINGS. AND HE'S JUST BALLSIER TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT LEAP. - I DON'T THINK SO. - DO YOU WANT TO JOIN THE BRIGADE, DAVE? - SURE. - CJ IS JUST KIND OF A DRIFTER, YOU KNOW? I THINK HE'S TOO CRAZY TO STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR TOO LONG OF A TIME PERIOD. I-I CAN JUST SEE HIM DOING THIS THE REST OF HIS LIFE. IT'S JUST WHAT HE DOES. - BE CAREFUL OF CARRIAGE. - CEEJ...BE CAREFUL. YOU KNOW? YEAH, YOU ARE. - NO, I'M NOT. NO. I DON'T WANT TO. MAYBE. - I'LL SEE YOU SOON. - BYE. - BYE. - HAVE A GOOD TRIP. - LATER, BUDDY. I'LL SEE YOU... - YEAH, MAN. - UH, SOONER THAN LATER. - YOU'RE ON FACEBOOK, RIGHT? - YEAH, YEAH, FOR SURE. ALL RIGHTY. - WE LOVE YOU, CJ. - LOVE YOU, TOO, BABE. - BYE, GREG. TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR BOY, ALL RIGHT? - WHERE DO YOU WANT ME, BUDDY? [laughs] WHERE DO YOU WANT ME? - GOOD LUCK TO HIM. HE'S GONNA NEED IT. - BYE, CJ! WE LOVE YOU! - HEY, CAN I GET A BOOB, KAT? JUST ONE, JUST ONE FOR GOOD-BYE. [laughs] - I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT I DO IN MY FREE TIME? - I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET THIS, SAM, BUT I'M STILL YOUR BOSS. YOU STILL HAVE TO REPORT TO ME. YOU STILL HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON. - SO NOW THAT CJ HAS FINALLY SAILED AWAY, THANK GOD, WE HAVE A TRIP TOMORROW. WE ALL NEED TO BE ON OUR "A" GAME AND GET BACK TO WORK. - THANK YOU, LOVE. YEAH, I'VE BEEN WORKING. - YEAH, SHE'S WORKING. - SO YOU'RE STAYING? - YEAH, I'M STAYING, BUT I'D LIKE ALL OF MY MONEY. I JUST WANT MY BEANS, WHICH ARE THOROUGHLY DESERVED AND BELONGING TO ME. - THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION THAT I CAN MAKE. - I DON'T EVEN WANT TO LOOK AT YOUR FACE, ADRIENNE. IT HURTS ME TO LOOK AT IT, LITERALLY. - EVERYBODY'S ARGUING. MAKE IT STOP. - I JUST RAN INTO SAM DOWN IN THE CREW MESS. AND SHE SAID "I WANT ALL MY MONEY, 'CAUSE I DESERVE IT." - OKAY. - SO HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE THAT? - BASICALLY TELL HER, YOU KNOW, WHAT ALEKS SAID IS FINAL. - SHE JUST WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM AND SAID, "I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT YOUR FACE, ADRIENNE. IT HURTS ME TO LOOK AT YOUR FACE." I WANT HER OUT OF HERE. I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]. GIVE HER HER MONEY, AND LET HER GET OUT OF HERE. I'M OVER IT. - ADRIENNE, ADRIENNE, ALEKS. - CAN WE DO THIS NOW, ALEKS? - HALF DECK, PLEASE. WE HAVE SAM AND ADRIENNE THAT ARE, UM, ARE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS, SO THAT'S OUR ONLY KINK LEFT IN THE CHAIN. AND WE HAVE ONE CHARTER LEFT. I THINK WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND JUST PUSH ALL EGOS ASIDE AND KICK ASS AND GET IT DONE. THE PROBLEM WE HAD THERE IN THAT WHOLE CONVERSATION WAS, THE POINT DIDN'T GET ACROSS. - I DON'T THINK THE POINT GOT ACROSS TO YOU, BECAUSE I CHECKED WITH ADRIENNE, AND I CHECKED WITH KAT-- - YOU TOLD ME WHAT YOU WERE DOING, WHICH WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING. - DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHEN I'M GONNA-- - YEAH, THAT'D BE NICE TO KNOW. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU, "PLEASE DON'T JUMP IN THE WATER, BECAUSE "THE GUESTS ARE HERE, AND IF THEY SEE YOU, THEN THEY'RE GONNA THINK WE'RE ALL SCREWING OFF." I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET THIS, SAM, BUT I'M STILL YOUR BOSS. YOU STILL HAVE TO REPORT TO ME. YOU STILL HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON. - AND THAT'S WHAT I DID. - END OF STORY. NO, YOU DIDN'T. - I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT I DO IN MY FREE TIME? - YOU HAVE TO TELL ME IF YOU'RE GONNA GO INTO THE WATER, BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE SEEN BY THE GUESTS. - YOU WEREN'T HERE. - YOU DON'T KNOW ALL OF-- I WAS. IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE. I'M DONE WITH YOUR EXCUSES. - FINE, ADRIENNE, FINE. - I'M STILL YOUR BOSS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE ME AS A PERSON, BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO RESPECT ME AS YOUR BOSS. - ALL RIGHT, GREAT. HALF OF ME SO DESPERATELY WANTS TO GO BACK TO MY OFFICE, BUT THEN I WOULD JUST BE QUITTING. I'D BE FORFEITING EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE SINCE THE BEGINNING. - ARE YOU STAYING? - YEAH. AM I HERE? AM I ON THE BOAT? - HAVE YOU GIVEN HER THE $300 YET? BECAUSE? - YOU KNOW WHAT? I APPRECIATE HER FOR STICKING UP FOR HERSELF AND STAYING ON THE BOAT, RATHER THAN JUMPING SHIP. - OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T EXPRESS ENOUGH... ADRIENNE HAS FIREBALLS IN HER EYES RIGHT NOW. ALEKS ESSENTIALLY JUST COCK-SLAPPED ADRIENNE IN THE FACE. - OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A LEARNING CURVE FOR EVERYONE. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY FOR ME. IT'S THE POINT OF GETTING THE POINT ACROSS. - REALLY? [bleep] YOU. I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. WHY ARE WE STILL HERE? AND I'M THE JERK AGAIN. - WANT TO BE PART OF THE TEAM? OR YOU DON'T? - I WANT TO BE PART OF THE TEAM. - ALL RIGHT, SO YOU GIRLS GET ALONG. [chuckles] WE GOT ONE MORE CHARTER LEFT. LET'S JUST BUST ASS ON THIS. LET'S PUT EVERYTHING BEHIND US. - THANKS, ALEKSIO. - YES. - I FEEL VICTORIOUS. KEEP MY TIP, KEEP MY JOB, WIN-WIN ALL AROUND. - I DON'T WANT THEM LEAVING, UNLESS WE GO RIGHT HERE TO THE CASINO AND COME RIGHT BACK. ARE YOU MAKING DINNER OR NOT? - YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE GOING OUT TO DINNER OR STAYING ON THE BOAT OR WHATEVER. I JUST NEED TO KNOW, BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW IF I NEED TO MAKE DINNER. APPARENTLY, YOU'RE ON LOCKDOWN. - I'M ON WHAT? - WE'RE STAYING HERE TONIGHT. - I'M ON LOCKDOWN? - IF WE'RE NOT EATING DINNER HERE, WE'RE EATING DINNER AT THE CASINO, AND THAT'S IT. LET ME HAVE A CONVERSATION REAL QUICKLY AND FIND OUT. SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE DEAL IS FOR TONIGHT. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO LEAVE, ESPECIALLY MY GIRLS. EVERYBODY STAYS ON BOARD, NO BOOZE TONIGHT. BEN, BEN, CAN YOU COME OUT HERE TO THE UP DECK, PLEASE? LAST CHARTER, LET'S JUST PUMP THROUGH IT. - WHAT'S UP? - WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THAI FOOD? - SO THAT WAY YOU CAN RELAX, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SCREW UP YOUR KITCHEN AGAIN, 'CAUSE YOU JUST CLEANED IT. - THAT'S FINE, THANK YOU. - AND WE'LL ORDER THAI FOOD, BUT NOBODY'S LEAVING THE BOAT TONIGHT. - OKAY. [murmuring] - YEAH, BUT WHO'S THIS COMING FROM? - US. - NO ONE SAYS THAT I'VE GOT TO STAY ON THE BOAT, JUST TO CLARIFY, RIGHT? - NO, NO, I KNOW, I MEAN-- - OKAY, SO-- - NO, WE JUST DON'T WANT ANYBODY GOING ANYWHERE. IT'S AN EARLY DAY. - YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT UP TO YOU, THOUGH, OKAY? - IT KIND OF IS. - NO, IT'S-- YOU THINK YOU'RE MY BOSS, IS THAT RIGHT? - TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY STAYS IN GOOD SHAPE FOR-- - BUT YOU'RE NOT MY BOSS. - DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, BEN. - YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. - THAT'S FINE. DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. I DON'T WANT MY GIRLS GOING ANYWHERE. IT'S UP TO YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR GUYS. - JUST SO YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. I'M ACTUALLY A HIGHER RANK THAN YOU, SO... PLEASE, COME ON, YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER. SORRY, LOVE. - ARE YOU GONNA TELL YOUR GUYS TO HANG IN HERE TONIGHT? - YEAH, I'M GONNA TALK TO THEM FIRST. I CAN'T JUST TELL THEM. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I COULD TELL THEM THAT, BUT IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A COUPLE BEERS ON THE DOCK, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA HOLD THAT AGAINST THEM. - YEAH, BUT A COUPLE OF BEERS ON THIS BOAT TURNS INTO A [bleep] SHOW, AND YOU KNOW THAT. - CJ'S GONE. IT'S NOT A [bleep] SHOW ANYMORE. - I DON'T TRUST THAT. I CAN SAY, "YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT." I'M TIRED OF BEING THE BAD GUY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THROUGH THIS LAST CHARTER, EVEN IF I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING MYSELF AT THIS POINT. THEY HAVEN'T PROVEN TO ME THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE WHEN THEY DO. - ALL RIGHT. - THAT'S WHERE I AM. - YOU'RE SPEAKING FOR YOUR GROUP. I'LL SPEAK FOR MINE. - YEAH. I UNDERSTAND. - ALL RIGHT. - HEY, ADRIENNE. - YEAH? - CAN YOU COME HERE? - YEAH. - I JUST WANTED TO TALK WITH YOU QUICKLY. - SURE. - JUST KIND OF ME AND YOU. I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE FOR, LIKE, EVERYTHING THAT I'VE CAUSED, ALL THE PROBLEMS I'VE CAUSED AND RUDE THINGS I'VE SAID IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS. THAT'S NOT THE PERSON I KNOW I AM, AND I WANT US-- I WANT TO PULL IT TOGETHER AND MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL, YOU KNOW, END OF THE SEASON. THINGS HAVE BEEN BUILDING UP INSIDE ME ABOUT MY ACTIONS, ABOUT MY DRINKING, ABOUT MY COWORKERS, ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIPS. WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER WITH, I WANT TO BE PROUD OF WHO I'VE TURNED OUT TO BE. AND I WANT MY COWORKERS TO FEEL THE SAME. - IT CAN ONLY GET BETTER IF WE'RE WORKING AS A TEAM. - JUST THANKS FOR LISTENING. - YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS. - CAN I HAVE A HUG? - YEAH, DEFINITELY. - AW, THANKS. - SO I WAS TELLING DAVE THAT ONE OF YOU GUYS IS GONNA HAVE TO WAKE ME UP FROM NOW ON, 'CAUSE I HAVE NO DEVICE, PHONE, IPAD, ALARM CLOCK WHATSOEVER. - ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'LL WAKE YOU UP. - HE'S ALWAYS UP BEFORE I AM ANYWAY. I'M LIKE, LYING IN BED, LIKE, "[bleep] MY LIFE RIGHT NOW!" - HE ACTUALLY, MOST OF THE TIME, WAKES UP TO MY NAKED ASS. - AND HE PUTS HIS UNDERWEAR ON AND HE TURNS AROUND, AND THEN I JUST FEEL LIKE LESS OF A MAN, BECAUSE, LIKE, HIS [bleep] HORSE [bleep] IS SHOWING THROUGH. AND I'M JUST LIKE... - I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. - GODDAMN IT! - [whispers] TOUCH IT. - "TOUCH IT." - CHEERS. - CHEERS. - TO A [bleep] TIP. - THE WORST TIP SO FAR. - WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. - IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. - TO CJ. - TO CEEJ. - TO CEEJ. - I HAVE THE ITINERARY FOR THIS TRIP. - ARE THEY VEGANS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? - I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT 'EM YET. - OKAY, SURE. - I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME FEMALE COUPLES ON THIS TRIP. - YEAH, BUT THAT SHOULDN'T AFFECT IT. THEY PROBABLY LIKE STEAK, RIGHT? - I DON'T KNOW. I ALSO HAVE A PROVISION SHEET FOR THE DOG. - OH, MY GOD. THIS IS HILARIOUS. - SO I WANTED-- - DO I HAVE TO COOK FOR THE DOG, YEAH? - READ THE SHEET. - OH, MY GOD. HIS NAME IS "KOMPIS CLICQUOT NOIR ULBRICH." NICE. FILET MIGNON, FREEZE-DRIED LIVER. MY WORK'S REALLY CUT OUT, YOU KNOW. I'VE GOT TO COOK FOR THESE, YOU KNOW, SEVEN PEOPLE, WHICH IS NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT THEY JUST HOLD THIS DOG IN SUCH GREAT VALUE. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, SURE, HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL PERSONALITY, BUT I MEAN, I JUST TAKE HUMANS FIRST. I SHOULD PUT A PICTURE OF THE LITTLE [bleep] RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME ACTUALLY, JUST TO REMIND ME. - SHOULD I WEAR PANTS OR A SKIRT? - JUDGING BY THE PICTURES, I WOULD WEAR A SKIRT. - YEAH, 'CAUSE THEY'LL-- - THEY'RE ALL KIND OF, UH, BUTCH. - ALL RIGHT, A SKIRT IT IS. - A SKIRT IT IS.

OH, YEAH, COPY. - YEAH. WERE THEY DRINKING SOMETHING ELSE? THEY SEEM TO LIKE THEM, RIGHT? - YEAH, SURE. - WHO BRINGS A PROM DRESS TO THE CARIBBEAN? I MEAN, DID SHE MAKE IT? DID SHE PULL IT OUT OF A HAT? IT'S SO WEIRD. - I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU. [all cheering] - FANTASTIC. - WHOO-HOO! - WHO IS THIS WOMAN? DOES ANYBODY RECOGNIZE HER? - I DON'T RECOGNIZE YOU. WHO ARE YOU? [overlapping chatter] - WELL, YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT DRUNK. - CHIEF STEW... EXTRAORDINAIRE. [all cheering] - WHY DID SHE FEEL THE NEED TO ENTER FROM THE SUN DECK, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL? AND FURTHERMORE, WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT PAIRING, LIKE, A SUPER SWEET CHEAP-ASS VODKA SHOT WITH, LIKE, A FIVE-COURSE GOURMET MEAL? I REMEMBER MY FRESHMAN YEAR IN COLLEGE TOO. - AND THAT IS THE LAST ONE, AND THEN WE'RE READY TO GO. [background chatter] - THIS SHIRT USED TO FIT ME, AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO BEFORE DINNER. - WE WANT MUSIC! LET'S DO THIS. - CHEERS. HERE'S TO TAKING CARE OF THE FAMILY. [all cheering] - OUT OF NOWHERE, ADRIENNE'S COME OUT OF THE CLOSET, VERY, VERY QUIETLY. SHE'S JUST EXPLODING WITH ALL OF THIS FEMININE GRACE. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS A BOTTOM. WE'RE AT THIS BEAUTIFUL BEACH BAR. PEOPLE ARE COUPLING OFF. I LOOK AROUND. PEOPLE ARE DANCING, AND IT'S JUST, LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO DANCE. I WANT TO DANCE WITH MY BOYFRIEND. I'M HERE ALONE, YOU KNOW. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR WEEKS. I'M SO TIRED, AND I CAN'T-- EVERYWHERE I LOOK, I SEE TREVOR. - THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT MAKES THE JOB WORTH IT. IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF MY POLO AND PUT ON SOMETHING NICE AND AND GO OUT AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IF ALL THE NAPKINS ARE FOLDED OR IF ALL THE LAUNDRY IS DONE. I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME WITH THEM. AND I THINK THESE LADIES HAVE DEFINITELY MADE ME FEEL A LOT MORE LIKE MYSELF. - HEY. - HEY, HOW'S IT GOING? - I'M TREVOR. - TREVOR. WAIT. YOU'RE, LIKE, THE TREVOR? - I AM THE TREVOR. - HEY, DAVE, CAN YOU GET YOUR [bleep] ASS OUT HERE RIGHT NOW? DAVE, YOU REALLY [bleep] UP, BRO. - COME ON, KOMPIS, DO YOUR THING. COME ON, KOMPIS, PLEASE TAKE A DUMP. - I FORGOT TO TELL HIM, THERE'S A COMMAND, "GO POO POO." I CAN SAY, "GO POO POO," AND SHE'LL BE LIKE, "OH, YEAH," AND SHE'LL GO POO POO. LIKE, SAYING "GO POO POO" WILL HELP. - OKAY. UM, SHE SAID TO LET ED KNOW THAT IF HE USES THE COMMAND, "GO POO POO," IT WILL LITERALLY MAKE THE DOG GO POO POO. - ED, ED, LEE. - GO AHEAD, LEE. - OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL. INSTEAD OF JUST WALKING THE DOG AROUND, YOU NEED TO USE THE COMMAND, "GO POO POO." - [laughs] - AND THE DOG IS SUPPOSED TO COP A SQUAT. - ROGER THAT. COMMENCING NEW TECHNIQUE. GO POO. GO POO. DOG, YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO, ARE YOU? NO, I DON'T THINK YOU ARE. - PORT OF PLAISANCE, PORT OF PLAISANCE, I JUST WANTED YOU TO BE ADVISED THAT WE WILL BE COMING INTO OUR HOME SLIP. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WE'RE HEADED IN. LET ME KNOW WHEN I'VE CLEARED. - YOU'RE CLEAR NOW. [overlapping chatter] - GOOD-BYE, YOU GUYS. - OH! [overlapping chatter] - I ALSO HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU AND THE CREW. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR GOOD SERVICE. - BYE. TAKE CARE. - BYE. - I NEED ALL THE CREW DOWN IN THE CREW MESS A.S.A.P. THANK YOU. - ALL RIGHT, GUYS. - ALL RIGHT, HERE'S TO THE END OF THE SEASON. - CHEERS, GUYS. - GO POO POO. - TOAST? - NO. - WE HAVE A GREAT ENERGY ONBOARD RIGHT NOW. IT WAS A BLOODY STRUGGLE FROM THE GET-GO, AND NOW IT'S JUST A MASSIVE SIGH OF RELIEF. I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST. IT'S AMAZING. IT'S A GREAT FEELING. EVERYONE'S HAPPY. - 10 GRAND, WHOO! - PLUS. - REALLY? - WONDERFUL. - WE GOT A $12,000 TIP FOR OUR CREW. WE WERE ALL BLOWN AWAY. AND WE ARE SO INCREDIBLY THANKFUL. THESE LADIES WERE AWESOME. - 1,200 PER PERSON, BECAUSE WE ARE SPLITTING IT TEN WAYS. - CHEERS, CJ. - THANKS, CJ. - I GUESS WE DID OUR JOB WELL. AND ADRIENNE PROBABLY SCISSORED HALF OF THEM, AND FOR THAT, I THANK HER. - I LEARNED THIS JOB IS HARD WORK, BUT IT'S VERY REWARDING. AND, UH... - YOU THINK IT'S REWARDING, EDDIE? - YEAH. - DO YOU? - YEAH, I DO. - WELL, GOOD, LET'S GIVE YOU A REWARD THEN. all: OH! - LET'S GIVE YOU A PROMOTION. - OH, MAN. [applause] - I'M GONNA CRY. - MY GRANDFATHER WAS A REAR ADMIRAL IN THE NAVY, AND SO I LOOKED UP TO HIM BIG-TIME. HIS LOVE FOR THE WATER KIND OF RUBBED OFF ON ME. AND MY FATHER ALWAYS LOVED THE WATER. AND THAT REALLY MEANS A LOT, YOU KNOW, IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO TELL ME THAT I DESERVE IT. JUST TO GET THAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, IT FEELS GREAT. I REALLY, REALLY LOVE IT. JUST BRUSH THOSE SHOULDERS OFF THERE. - TIME TO SPEND THE KITTY, WHICH I THINK THERE IS, LIKE, ALMOST 1,800 BUCKS IN THE KITTY. SO YOU GUYS SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME FUN WITH THAT. - YES! - CAN WE GET COMPLETELY-- - LET'S JUST GO AND PUT IT ALL ON BLACK. - 5,150, THAT'S WHAT IT IS... - NOT A BAD TAKE. - FOR THE SEASON. THINK THAT WOULD GET ME TO, UH, SINGAPORE AND AUSTRALIA AND BACK? WORKING ON A MEGA YACHT IS NOT FOR ME. I HAD BIGGER HOPES, I GUESS, FOR WHAT THIS WOULD ENTAIL. HEY, ADRIENNE, WHILE I HAVE YOU HERE ALONE, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING UP WITH ME. AND I MEAN THAT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. THANK YOU. - I...APPRECIATE THAT MORE THAN YOU KNOW. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I NEVER WANTED TO DEMAND ANYTHING FROM YOU OR COMMAND YOU TO DO ANYTHING. I THINK-- - BUT YOU SHOULDN'T-- I MEAN, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO, AND THAT'S WHERE IT WAS MY FAULT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO DEMAND ANYTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE, ASKING SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. - I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THIS, BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LET PEOPLE MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS AND THEIR OWN MISTAKES FOR THEM TO LEARN. I THINK OUR AUTHORITY ISSUES ARE SIMILAR. - I DON'T HAVE ISSUES WITH AUTHORITY. - YOU DO. - LET'S JUST LEAVE IT ON A GOOD NOTE. AND I WISH YOU HAD A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, BUT-- - GO TEAM. - I'M GLAD THIS IS THE LAST ONE. - ME TOO. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR PARTY WHERE I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO TO SLEEP AND WAKE UP AND DO [bleep] IN THE MORNING. - [laughs] - THEY AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET. - OH, MY GOD. - NAH, CAPTAIN, I'M JUST FOOLING. - WELL, I MUST SAY, I LIKE WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. - I FEEL SO GOOD. I DON'T WANT TO DRINK AS MUCH AS I HAVE BEEN. I WANT TO REMEMBER MY EXPERIENCES. AND I'M GONNA PROVE TO EVERYONE THAT I'M NOT WHO I REPRESENTED MYSELF AS. - IT IS NOTICEABLE. - REALLY? - REALLY. - HI THERE. - LET'S SIT TOGETHER. - YEAH, CAN WE, PLEASE? - SEE WHAT WE'RE DRINKING RIGHT HERE, GUYS? - CRISTAL. - OH, WE'RE DOING BIG, HUH? - REALLY? - YEAH. - SO TONIGHT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A NICE DINNER TOGETHER, ENJOY EACH OTHER'S COMPANY FOR THE LAST TIME. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL EVENING. EVERYONE'S FEELING GOOD. I COULDN'T BE MORE ECSTATIC. - CAN WE ROLL DOWN TO THE BEACH AND WATCH THE SUNSET? - ALL RIGHT, SHOES? - NO, YOU DON'T NEED SHOES. - OH, YEAH? - THIS IS OUR SUNSET. - THIS IS MY SUNSET. - A CHEERS TO THE SUN SETTING ON A BEAUTIFUL CHARTER EXPERIENCE. - CHEERS, KIDS. WELL DONE. - ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT WE ORDER SOME APPETIZERS AND GET SOME FOOD, HUH? - HOW DID YOU GET SAND IN YOUR HAIR? WHAT HAPPENED? - THERE'S A GAMUT OF EMOTIONS, YOU KNOW. I'M SO ANXIOUS TO GET BACK HOME TO TREVOR. BUT I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM MY CREW AND THE CHARTER GUEST AND THE CAPTAIN, AND I'M SO INCREDIBLY THANKFUL. - LICK IT. - [laughing] HOLD ON. - EVERYBODY ELSE. - HERE'S TO HONOR. CHEERS. - HERE'S TO THE NEXT SEASON. UH-- - LET'S PLAY A LITTLE GAME... - WHAT DO YOU WANNA PLAY? - AND IT'S CALLED "EVERYBODY HAS TO SAY WHAT THEY'RE DOING AFTER THIS," OKAY? ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO AROUND THE TABLE. BEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING AFTER THIS? - I'M GONNA GO TO CAPE COD... - YOU ARE? - AND SEE MY FAMILY. - THAT'S NICE. - EDDIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - I'M GOING BACK TO BALTIMORE, GO BACK TO WORKING AT AN OUTDOOR STORE AGAIN FOR A LITTLE BIT, SELLING OUTDOOR GEAR. - YOU GUYS WILL HAVE TO HEAR WHAT SAM'S DOING. SAM IS GOING TO TAIWAN. - WHAT? - SINGAPORE. - SINGAPORE, CHINA. - ALL I KNOW IS SINGAPORE AND AUSTRALIA. IF I'M REALLY ABLE TO BALL OUT THE ENTIRE TIME, I'LL GO TO NEW ZEALAND, AND THEN I'M COMING HOME. I'VE WORKED HARDER THIS CHARTER SEASON THAN I EVER HAVE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I WAS KIND OF IN A PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE WAS VERY STAGNANT. I HAD LIVED IN TAMPA MY WHOLE LIFE. I JUST NEEDED SOMETHING MORE. - ALL RIGHT, ALEKS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - BACK TO THE OLD GRIND, YOU KNOW, DOING CHARTERS BACK IN L.A., WORLDWIDE. I GOT A COUPLE OF CHARTERS IN THE MED THIS YEAR, IN THE SUMMERTIME WITH SOME CELEBRITY CLIENTS. - ALEKS ACTUALLY OFFERED ME A JOB WITH HIM. - YEAH, I'M EXCITED TO GET HOME. - I'M EXCITED TO GET HOME TOO. - I THINK WE ALL ARE. IT'S TIME FOR A NICE LITTLE BREAK. - IT'S SO FUNNY TODAY. IT WAS, LIKE, ALL OF MY ENERGY, EVERYTHING JUST LEFT MY BODY. IT WAS AMAZING, AND I WAS JUST LEFT WITH, LIKE, A CARCASS. - [laughs] - THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STRESS ON EVERYONE'S PART, LIKE, FOR THIS WHOLE SEASON. IT'S JUST A SHAME THAT IT'S OUR LAST DINNER TOGETHER, BUT, UH, LIFE GOES ON, EH? - STOLE MY CLOTHES. - WHAT ARE YOU WEARING, MY DEAR? - I'M WEARING A COMFORTER. [laughter] - [humming] - TODAY IS THE DAY THAT WE LEAVE. I'M JUST HAPPY THAT WE'RE GETTING TO GO HOME NOW. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? - HAVE YOU GOT ANY SPARE UNDERWEAR? [both laugh] - IT'S BEEN REAL [bleep] PLEASURE, BRO. - HOORAH. YACHTING, FOR ME, IT'S NOT A GAME. THIS IS MY CAREER. I'VE BEEN SO MOTIVATED, SO FOCUSED IN, YOU KNOW, BEING THE BEST OF THE BEST. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SUCCEED AT. - ALL RIGHT, BUDDY, TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. GOOD LUCK, ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, IT WAS FUN. - IT'S BEEN A SLICE. - [chuckles] - I FEEL LIKE A WEIGHT IS ABOUT TO BE LIFTED. THIS HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. AND I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM MY CREW AND THE CHARTER GUESTS AND THE CAPTAIN. YOU KNOW, I'M WALKING AWAY FROM THIS A BETTER PERSON FOR KNOWING THEM. - HEY. - HEY, HOW'S IT GOING? - I'M TREVOR. - TREVOR. - I'M HERE TO SEE DAVE. - WAIT, YOU'RE, LIKE, THE TREVOR? - I AM THE TREVOR. - LIKE, HIS TREVOR? - YEP. - DOES HE KNOW? - NO, NOT A CLUE. - LET'S GO GET HIM. - LET'S DO THIS. - HEY, DAVE, CAN YOU GET YOUR [bleep] ASS OUT HERE RIGHT NOW? - DAVE! - YEAH, DAVE, YOU [bleep]. - DAVE, YOU REALLY [bleep] UP, BRO. GET THE [bleep] OUT HERE. - AHH! - HI, BABY. - [laughs] - AHH! - HOLY [bleep]. [laughs] THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT OF THIS CHARTER SEASON HAS BEEN THE DISTANCE AND THE ABSENCE OF MY PARTNER. I FEEL LIKE THIS RING, THIS RELATIONSHIP, IT'S JUST STARTING A NEW CHAPTER. THEY SAY ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER, AND IT REALLY DOES. I REALIZED I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HIM. - ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS. - TAKE CARE, PAL. - THANK YOU, SIR. - IT'S BEEN A SLICE. - YES, IT SURE HAS. IT'S BEEN REALLY AN HONOR BEING ON BOARD. - YEAH, NO PUN INTENDED. THAT WAS TERRIBLE. - THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE SO FAR, IT'S ALL JUST BEEN SURPRISING. AND EVERY DAY IS JUST A NEW--NEW CRAZY ADVENTURE. - BYE, BABE. IT WAS GREAT WORKING WITH YOU. - IT WAS, WASN'T IT? - OKAY. - WHOO! - OKAY, OKAY. - JUST, JUST-- - WAIT, STOP. - JUST CHILL. JUST RELAX, OKAY? [laughs] I LOVE BOATS. I'LL ALWAYS PROBABLY DIP IN AND OUT OF THE INDUSTRY, BUT ULTIMATELY, I WANT A LAND LIFE. I WANT A CAR. I WANT A GIRLFRIEND. I WANT AN APARTMENT. I'VE GOT A LOT OF BIG GOALS THAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH, BEYOND YACHTING. - ALL I WANT TO SAY TO BEN IS THANK YOU. WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME TOGETHER. NEXT VICTIM. TRY NOT TO [bleep] ADRIENNE BEFORE YOU LEAVE. - OH, I CAN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING. - ADRIENNE. BEING CRAZY AND UNABLE TO ENJOY BEING A YACHTIE IS NOT NORMAL. LIKE, THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE JUST ABNORMALLY HIGH-STRUNG AND INSANE. er, giggling] - THIS CHARTER SEASON HAS BEEN THE MOST DIFFICULT OF MY LIFE, BUT I LOVE DOING WHAT I DO. I THINK, YOU KNOW, THIS EXPERIENCE WAS A DEFINITE LEARNING CURVE FOR ME, AND I PERSEVERED THROUGH THIS. I DEFITELY LEARNED A LOT. I HAVE MORE KNOWLEDGE. I HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE. I HAVE MORE SKILLS. HOPEFULLY, A LITTLE BIT MORE WISDOM COMING OUT OF THIS. AND I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE I COULD DO IT AGAIN.
