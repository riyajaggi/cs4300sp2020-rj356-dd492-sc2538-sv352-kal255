 BUT AFTER A TURBULENT THREE-YEAR MARRIAGE, HIS MIND IS MADE UP. COURTNEY AND ROBERT FIRST MET ATTENDING THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. WE HAD A VERY STRONG CONNECTION. WE REALLY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER, SO WE REALLY FELL IN LOVE. BUT THEN THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE. HE STARTED DRINKING, OUT PARTYING WITH HIS FRIENDS. I WANTED TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STOP, AND I DID, BUT HE NEVER LISTENED TO ME. Narrator: COURTNEY IS DEVASTATED. AT THE LAST MINUTE, HE LET ME KNOW THAT HE WAS PACKING AND LEAVING. Narrator: SHE HAS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN - A HEARING DAUGHTER NAMED RANA WITH ROBERT AND A HEARING SON NAMED JASON FROM AN EARLIER RELATIONSHIP. AFRAID AND UNWILLING TO FACE LIFE AS A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO, THIS WIFE REFUSES TO LET HER HUSBAND GO QUIETLY. IT HASN'T BEEN AN EASY ROAD FOR COURTNEY. EVEN AS A CHILD, LOVE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE JUST OUT OF REACH. MY PARENTS FOUND OUT THAT I WAS DEAF WHEN I WAS BORN, AND THEY WERE SAD. THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED. Woman: AND WE WERE IN THE WATER, AND... I'LL TELL YOU IN A MINUTE. Narrator: COURTNEY GREW UP IN AN ALL-HEARING FAMILY... [ LAUGHTER ] ...THE MIDDLE CHILD OF THREE GIRLS. I FELT LIKE THEY WOULD IGNORE ME. Narrator: COURTNEY DESPERATELY WANTS HER FATHER'S LOVE AND APPROVAL. MY PARENTS DIVORCED WHEN I WAS 4 OR 5. I DO BELIEVE MY FATHER IS CLOSER TO MY SISTERS. I DON'T THINK HE TRULY ACCEPTED WHO I AM. Narrator: WHEN HER FATHER REMARRIES, COURTNEY FEELS IT DRIVES AN EVEN BIGGER WEDGE BETWEEN THEM. DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. FOR COURTNEY, HER NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD, THAT CRAVING FOR LOVE AND ATTENTION WHICH WAS ALWAYS MISSING IN HER CHILDHOOD, IS REALLY GOING TO AFFECT ALL OF HER FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU - I DON'T TRUST HEARING PEOPLE. I HAVEN'T TRUSTED THEM FOR YEARS. MM-HMM. BECAUSE OF MY FATHER. Narrator: DESPITE THEIR CHALLENGING RELATIONSHIP, COURTNEY'S DAD OFFERS TO LET HER AND ROBERT LIVE IN A HOUSE HE OWNS. Interpreter: AT FIRST, IT WAS WONDERFUL, IN THE BEGINNING. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. THEN THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE. HE WOULD WORK AND PARTY, WORK AND PARTY. I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING UNTIL 2:00 OR 3:00 IN THE MORNING. Narrator: AS PAINFUL AS IT IS TO ADMIT, COURTNEY REALIZES HER PERFECT LIFE WITH ROBERT IS JUST A FANTASY, AND THE IDEA OF BEING STRANDED WITH TWO YOUNG KIDS IS TOO MUCH FOR HER TO HANDLE. SHE BELIEVES HER ONLY OPTION IS SUICIDE. [ KNIFE CLATTERS ] ROBERT CAN'T HANDLE THE SITUATION. HE CALLS COURTNEY'S PARENTS, THEN LEAVES. HER PARENTS DECIDE SHE NEEDS HELP. COURTNEY AGREES TO CHECK HERSELF IN TO A MENTAL-HEALTH CLINIC. HER KIDS GO TO LIVE WITH HER FATHER AND STEPMOTHER. TWO WEEKS LATER, SHE COMES HOME TO AN EMPTY HOUSE AND A PILE OF BILLS. [ SIGHS ] Narrator: ROBERT WAS THE PRIMARY BREADWINNER, AND WITHOUT HIM, SHE'LL BARELY SCRAPE BY. THERE'S ONLY ONE SOLUTION - FIND ANOTHER MAN. Interpreter: I WAS TRYING TO LOOK FOR SOMEBODY THAT COULD HELP ME HAVE A STABLE LIFE AND A STABLE HOME. Dr. Jordan: DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT YOU NEEDED TO FIND YOURSELF ON YOUR OWN WITHOUT INTERPRETING YOURSELF THROUGH A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER MAN? WHEN I GREW UP, I WAS LONELY, AND I FELT LIKE I DIDN'T GET ATTENTION. I FELT LIKE I NEEDED LOVE. I NEEDED PASSION. I NEEDED TO HAVE SOMEBODY BY MY SIDE. Narrator: DARNELL IS A DEAF MAN FROM CALIFORNIA. COURTNEY HOPES HE'S HER TICKET OUT OF LONELINESS. Interpreter: I NEEDED SOMEBODY THERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH AND TO UNDERSTAND MY HEART. Narrator: AFTER JUST A FEW WEEKS OF DATING, DARNELL INVITES HER TO FOLLOW HIM BACK TO THE WEST COAST. COURTNEY THINKS A FRESH START IN A NEW PLACE IS JUST WHAT SHE NEEDS. THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM - WHAT TO DO WITH HER KIDS. ONCE AGAIN, HER DAD AND STEPMOM ARE THERE FOR HER. IT WAS WHAT WAS BEST FOR THE KIDS. I WANTED THEM TO HAVE A SAFE AND STABLE ENVIRONMENT AND GO TO SCHOOL. I KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR KIDS TO HAVE A STABLE LIFE AND NOT BE MOVING AROUND TOO MUCH. Dr. Jordan: COURTNEY'S NEVER GONNA BE COMFORTABLE WITH HERSELF, BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN BEING AT PEACE WITH THE ISOLATION THAT SHE'S GROWN UP WITH. SHE NEEDS A MAN IN HER LIFE TO BE HER CONDUIT TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. Narrator: AFTER PROMISING HER KIDS SHE'LL COME BACK FOR THEM ONCE SHE'S SETTLED, COURTNEY HEADS OUT TO VISALIA, CALIFORNIA, 200 MILES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES. THE FIRST FEW WEEKS THERE ARE PURE BLISS. COURTNEY LOVES CALIFORNIA. SHE ALSO MAKES SOME NEW FRIENDS. I MET COURTNEY THROUGH DARNELL. SHE WAS SWEET. WE WOULD TALK. SHE WOULD EXPLAIN TO ME AND TALK TO ME ABOUT HER LIFE AND HER PARENTS. Narrator: BUT HER NEW FRIEND, KELLY LARSEN, SEES COURTNEY AND DARNELL'S RELATIONSHIP START TO SOUR PRETTY QUICKLY. FOR COURTNEY, THIS SHORT-LIVED RELATIONSHIP HAS HIT A DEAD END. Interpreter: WE HAD DECIDED TO SEPARATE BECAUSE HE WAS DRINKING. YOU KNOW, I GAVE HIM A CHOICE - "DO YOU WANT LOVE, OR DO YOU WANT ALCOHOL?" SO WE JUST DECIDED TO BE FRIENDS. Narrator: SHE PLANS TO HEAD HOME TO NORTH CAROLINA - THAT IS UNTIL SHE MEETS THE LARSENS' 21-YEAR-OLD SON, JONATHAN. JONATHAN WAS A VERY FUNNY, SWEET - OH, JUST LIKE A CLOWN. HE HAD A REALLY GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. HE LOVED TO HELP PEOPLE. Interpreter: WELL, AT FIRST, WHEN I SAW HIM, I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS MY TYPE. HE WASN'T SOMEBODY I WOULD DATE. [ CHUCKLES ] WE STARTED CHATTING. HE WAS VERY SMART, VERY INTERESTING, AND COMMUNICATION WAS WONDERFUL BETWEEN US. IT WAS PERFECT. IT WAS JUST SEAMLESS. Narrator: DESPITE HER FIRST IMPRESSION, COURTNEY FINDS HERSELF ATTRACTED TO JONATHAN. UNFORTUNATELY, HE ALREADY HAS A GIRLFRIEND. EVEN THOUGH HE'S OFF-LIMITS, COURTNEY HOPES THAT MAYBE SHE CAN WIN HIS AFFECTION. BUT SHE MAY NEVER GET THE CHANCE. COMING UP, A DRAMA-FILLED ROMANCE BETWEEN TWO FRAGILE PEOPLE BECOMES A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. Narrator: WINTER 2006. VISALIA, CALIFORNIA. AFTER A STRING OF FAILED RELATIONSHIPS, COURTNEY BELL HAS FALLEN FOR HER FRIEND'S SON, JONATHAN LARSEN, BUT HE'S DATING SOMEONE ELSE. THE COMPLICATED SITUATION THEN TAKES A NEAR-TRAGIC TURN. JONATHAN TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF BECAUSE HIS EX DECIDED TO BREAK UP WITH HIM. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] Narrator: JONATHAN'S FAMILY BARELY GETS HIM TO THE HOSPITAL IN TIME. [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] AFTER LEARNING WHAT HAPPENED, COURTNEY RUSHES TO HIS SIDE. SHE STILL THINKS A FUTURE WITH HIM IS POSSIBLE. WITH OUR DEAF CULTURE AND HIS FAMILY, I THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK. Narrator: JONATHAN IS HAPPY TO SEE HER. SHE LIFTS HIS SPIRITS AND PROMISES TO VISIT AS LONG AS HE'S THERE. AND THAT'S HOW THEY FELL IN LOVE - THERE AT THE HOSPITAL. Narrator: COURTNEY CANCELS HER PLANS TO GO BACK TO NORTH CAROLINA SO SHE CAN BE WITH JONATHAN. Interpreter: HE SAID, "IF YOU WANT ME TO STOP DRINKING, I'LL DO IT FOR YOU." HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR ME. SO THAT'S HOW I REALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM AND HIS PERSONALITY. Narrator: ONCE HE'S RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL, SHE MOVES IN WITH THE LARSENS, AND IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE A ROMANCE BLOSSOMS. THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN THE BEGINNING - IT WAS LIKE A STORYBOOK. Narrator: COURTNEY AND JONATHAN'S MOM, KELLY, ARE CLOSE... UNTIL KELLY LEARNS MORE ABOUT COURTNEY. SHE WAS SWEET AND NICE. WE GOT ALONG GREAT... UNTIL I FOUND OUT THAT SHE HAD KIDS. AND I SAID, "WHY ARE YOU NOT WITH YOUR KIDS?" SHE'S LIKE, "BECAUSE I NEED TO FIND A MAN TO SUPPORT ME," AND I WAS LIKE, "WHOA. WHAT? YOU NEED TO GO BACK HOME AND BE WITH YOUR KIDS." Narrator: COURTNEY TELLS KELLY TO MIND HER OWN BUSINESS. Interpreter #2: AND THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED NOT GETTING ALONG, AND THINGS JUST STARTED GETTING WORSE AND WORSE. BUT JONATHAN FELL IN LOVE WITH HER. Narrator: BUT KELLY LARSEN CAN'T KEEP HER FEELINGS TO HERSELF. SHE DOESN'T THINK COURTNEY IS GOOD FOR JONATHAN, AND SHE LETS HER KNOW IT. MY MOM JUST - HER HEAD JUST HIT THE ROOF, AND SHE DIDN'T WANT MY BROTHER TO BE AROUND SOMEBODY LIKE THAT. SO MY MOM STARTED HATING COURTNEY. WE HAD SOME PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF HIS MOTHER AND THEN HIS FATHER AND THEN HIS BROTHER, BECAUSE NONE OF THEM LIKED ME, AND THEY DISAGREED WITH THE FACT THAT HE WAS WITH ME. I THOUGHT THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. Narrator: JONATHAN TAKES COURTNEY'S SIDE AND TELLS HIS MOTHER TO STOP MEDDLING. MY MOM DIDN'T WANT JONATHAN TO GO, SO SHE LET THEM STAY. Dr. Jordan: JONATHAN'S FAMILY DOES NOT LIKE NOR ACCEPT COURTNEY, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE SHE'S LEFT HER CHILDREN BEHIND, AND THEY THINK THAT SHE IS A BAD INFLUENCE. THE CONFLICT IN THE HOUSE BECOMES REALLY PALPABLE, AND IT BECOMES VERY CLEAR TO COURTNEY THAT IT'S TIME TO GET OUT. Narrator: JULY 2007. AFTER A TENSE FEW MONTHS, COURTNEY CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. SHE AND JONATHAN MOVE BACK TO NORTH CAROLINA. THE HAPPY COUPLE RENTS A SMALL APARTMENT AND SETS UP HOUSE WITH PLANS FOR COURTNEY'S CHILDREN TO JOIN THEM ONCE THEY'RE SETTLED. IN ORDER TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH HIS FAMILY BACK IN CALIFORNIA, JONATHAN BUYS A VIDEO PHONE. IT'S ALWAYS UP AND RUNNING AND WILL BE A WINDOW INTO THIS COUPLE'S RELATIONSHIP. THE YOUNG LOVERS LIVE OFF THEIR GOVERNMENT-ASSISTANCE MONEY AND THE INCOME JONATHAN BRINGS IN FROM ODD JOBS. IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE COURTNEY FINDS OUT SHE'S PREGNANT YET AGAIN. Interpreter: JONATHAN WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT BEING A FATHER AND HAVING A CHILD. HE WAS VERY, VERY EXCITED. [ MUSIC BOX PLAYS ] Narrator: ON APRIL 6, 2008, COURTNEY AND JONATHAN CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF THEIR DAUGHTER, LESLIE. JONATHAN IS NERVOUS IN HIS NEW ROLE AS DAD BUT INSTANTLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH HER. ALTHOUGH BOTH PARENTS ARE DEAF, LESLIE CAN HEAR, JUST LIKE COURTNEY'S TWO OLDER CHILDREN. THEY'RE STILL LIVING WITH HER DAD AND STEPMOM, LESS THAN 20 MILES AWAY, AND COURTNEY VISITS THEM OFTEN. [ BABY FUSSES ] BUT THE STRESS AND EXPENSE OF HAVING A NEWBORN IS CREATING CRACKS IN THE COUPLE'S HAPPY RELATIONSHIP. HIS FAMILY WATCHES THROUGH THE VIDEO PHONE... CALEB. ...AS THIS COUPLE'S RELATIONSHIP QUICKLY UNRAVELS. Interpreter #2: JONATHAN WOULD WORK HARD - YOU KNOW, TWO DIFFERENT JOBS - AND COURTNEY WOULD SAY, "OH, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. I NEED MORE." AND JONATHAN FELT LIKE, "I HAVE TO DO MORE ALL THE TIME." Narrator: ACCORDING TO HIS FAMILY, COURTNEY STARTS ABUSING JONATHAN, EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY, WHEN HE FAILS TO LIVE UP TO HER EXPECTATIONS. I'VE SEEN COURTNEY PUSH HIM. I'VE SEEN HER SMACK THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. I'VE SEEN HER GETTING UP IN HIS FACE, YELLING AT HIM, BUT MOSTLY JUST PUSHING HIM AROUND. Caleb: HE WAS LIKE A HOLLOW MAN. HE WASN'T THE SAME COOL GUY THAT I KNEW - LIKE, THE ONE THAT WAS MELLOW AND CHILL. Narrator: BUT COURTNEY CLAIMS JONATHAN WAS THE REAL MANIPULATOR. Interpreter: HE WANTED THINGS HIS WAY, NOT MINE. THERE WERE A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS, SO I TRIED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I SAID. Dr. Jordan: ONCE COURTNEY AND JONATHAN HAVE LEFT HIS FAMILY, YOU WOULD THINK THEIR RELATIONSHIP WOULD IMPROVE, BUT THEIR FIGHTS BECOME MORE AND MORE PHYSICAL, AND YOU SEE A SLOW ESCALATION OF A SITUATION THAT CAN ONLY BECOME MORE DANGEROUS OVER TIME. Narrator: WHEN LESLIE IS 5 MONTHS OLD, JONATHAN COMES HOME FROM A LONG NIGHT OF DRINKING AND GETTING HIGH TO FIND COURTNEY TEXTING WITH A FRIEND. Betsy: HE WAS DRUNK - WAY VISIBLY DRUNK. SHE WAS TEXTING ANOTHER GUY - HER EX-HUSBAND - AND THAT SET HIM OFF. Dr. Jordan: COURTNEY, AT THIS POINT, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GETTING WORSE. IT'S NOT JUST JEALOUSY. IT'S NOT JUST CONTROLLING. HE'S BECOMING EXTREMELY POSSESSIVE. HE DIDN'T LIKE ME TO TALK WITH A LOT OF FRIENDS. MY EX-HUSBAND, ROBERT - WE HAD A CHILD TOGETHER. WE WERE FRIENDS. BUT IT WASN'T LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE WERE FLIRTING WITH EACH OTHER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW, WE WOULD JUST TALK ABOUT CATCHING UP ON OLD NEWS OR NEW NEWS. Interpreter #2: JONATHAN DOESN'T BLOW UP EASY. HE HOLDS THINGS IN, AND THEN - BOOM. Narrator: JEALOUSY AND MISTRUST HAVE TURNED COURTNEY AND JONATHAN LARSEN'S HAPPY HOME INTO A BATTLEFIELD. WHEN JONATHAN CATCHES HIS WIFE TALKING TO ONE OF HER EXES, HE THINKS THE WORST... AND LASHES OUT AT HER. [ BABY CRYING ] UNFORTUNATELY, THE COUPLE'S BABY GETS CAUGHT IN THE CROSS FIRE. Interpreter: I DIDN'T EVEN FEEL ANYTHING. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD A BLACK EYE UNTIL I SAW IT IN THE MIRROR, 'CAUSE I WAS IN SUCH SHOCK. AND MY DAUGHTER HAD A BRUISE ON HER HEAD, AND SHE WAS CRYING. Betsy: I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IN HIS NATURE TO HIT HER. I THINK THAT HE JUST DRANK TOO MUCH AND LET IT - EVERYTHING THAT WAS PILING UP GET TO HIM. Narrator: COURTNEY CALLS HIM AN UNFIT FATHER AND THREATENS THAT HE WILL NEVER SEE HER OR THEIR DAUGHTER AGAIN. Interpreter #2: HE WORSHIPPED HER. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER SHE WANTED HIM TO DO, HE WOULD DO. [ CRYING CONTINUES ] HE FELT LIKE HE WOULD TRY AND TRY AND TRY, AND WHATEVER HE DID WASN'T ENOUGH. I JUST THINK HE FELT LIKE HE WAS OUT OF OPTIONS. Narrator: AS SORRY AS JONATHAN IS, COURTNEY FEELS SHE CAN'T TRUST HIM. I CALLED THE POLICE. MM-HMM. IT'S THE FIRST TIME I DID, BUT I WAS AFRAID. Narrator: THE OFFICERS ARREST JONATHAN, THEN COURTNEY TAKES THE BABY TO THE HOSPITAL TO MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY. LUCKILY, LESLIE IS FINE, BUT COURTNEY IS CRUSHED WHEN SHE DISCOVERS THAT THE HOSPITAL STAFF HAS REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES. Interpreter: WHEN HE GAVE ME THAT BLACK EYE, CPS TOOK MY DAUGHTER, AND THAT LED ME TO JUST FEEL DEVASTATED AND LOSE ALL HOPE. [ BABY CRYING ] Narrator: CPS AGREES TO HAND LESLIE OVER TO COURTNEY'S DAD AND STEPMOM, WHO ARE ALREADY TAKING CARE OF COURTNEY'S TWO OLDER KIDS. WITH HER LIFE IN SHAMBLES, COURTNEY MAKES THE PAINFUL DECISION TO SIGN OVER CUSTODY OF JASON AND RANA, HER TWO OLDER CHILDREN, TO HER PARENTS. Dr. Jordan: THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE MATURE DECISIONS THAT COURTNEY ACTUALLY MAKES. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT HER NEED FOR A MAN IS OVERRIDING HER MATERNAL INSTINCTS AND THAT PERHAPS HER CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY BETTER OFF WITH HER FAMILY. Narrator: JONATHAN IS SENTENCED TO THREE MONTHS IN JAIL AND DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE COUNSELING. Caleb: HE SNAPPED. WE ALL BELIEVED THAT WASN'T RIGHT, AND HE KNEW IT. HE FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT IT, AND THAT HE WAS HAPPY THAT HE WENT TO JAIL. Narrator: BACK HOME, ALONE, COURTNEY'S STILL REELING FROM THE ATTACK. IN DECEMBER 2008, JONATHAN IS RELEASED FROM JAIL AND IMMEDIATELY DEFIES A COURT ORDER NOT TO CONTACT COURTNEY. Interpreter: I WANTED TO FORGET JONATHAN. I JUST WANTED TO PUT MY FOCUS ON SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT - A DIFFERENT LIFE. I FELT LIKE HE WAS A RISK. I KNEW IF I STAYED WITH HIM THAT, LATER ON, IT COULD BECOME WORSE, AND THAT WAS TAKING A CHANCE. Narrator: JONATHAN'S SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED. DESPITE THEIR PAST ISSUES, COURTNEY STILL LOVES HIM AND DECIDES TO GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE. SHE ALSO APOLOGIZES AND TELLS HIM THEY CAN WORK IT OUT. COURTNEY WAS VERY IN LOVE WITH JONATHAN, BUT IT WAS DANGEROUS AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, FOR HER TO BE WITH HIM. Narrator: THE YOUNG COUPLE VOWS TO REPAIR THEIR BROKEN RELATIONSHIP. Officiant: DO YOU TAKE THIS MAN TO BE YOUR HUSBAND? THE COUPLE WASTES NO TIME. IN LESS THAN A YEAR, THEY GET MARRIED AT CITY HALL AND MANAGE TO WIN BACK CUSTODY OF THEIR DAUGHTER, LESLIE, AND ON APRIL 13, 2010, ARE THRILLED TO WELCOME ANOTHER BABY GIRL THEY NAME JULIE. BUT SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME. JULIE IS DEAF. WE WERE SO EXCITED. I FELT SO HAPPY AND SO PROUD, 'CAUSE I FELT LIKE I WASN'T ALONE ANYMORE, AND JON FELT THE SAME WAY. Dr. Jordan: NOW COURTNEY HAS A DAUGHTER WHO IS JUST LIKE HER, WHO CAN GROW UP IN A DEAF CULTURE, WHICH COURTNEY AND JONATHAN ARE PROUD TO BE MEMBERS OF. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE CHILD WHO UNDERSTANDS HER OWN MOTHER, AND IN MANY WAYS, IT COMPLETES THE FAMILY THAT COURTNEY HAS ALWAYS WANTED. Narrator: TO HELP SUPPORT HIS FAMILY, JONATHAN POSTS AN AD ON CRAIGSLIST TO TUTOR PEOPLE IN AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE. OH, HI. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. [ CHUCKLES ] HE GETS A RESPONSE FROM LISA WATKINS, A MARRIED 28-YEAR-OLD. LISA. SHE'S PICKED UP A LITTLE ASL THROUGH PEOPLE SHE'S MET AND THINKS IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE. THE TWO MEET REGULARLY AND BECOME FRIENDS. "DANCE." I LIKE TO DANCE. [ CHUCKLES ] YES. WHAT? WINE. IT'S WINE WE'RE DRINKING. Narrator: THEY MEET EACH OTHER'S SPOUSES, AND THE COUPLES GROW CLOSE. I ALWAYS DO THINGS A LITTLE BACKWARDS, YOU KNOW? BUT IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE DAVID AND LISA GET A RINGSIDE SEAT TO THIS VOLATILE COUPLE'S BITTER BATTLES. I GOT TO KNOW THEM A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THEIR RELATIONSHIP SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE ROCKY. SHE WOULD LIE, MANIPULATE, AND JUST DO WHATEVER SHE CAN TO GET HER WAY. SHE WOULD CALL HIM NAMES AND PUT HIM DOWN. Narrator: JONATHAN'S FAMILY CLAIMS COURTNEY ALSO STARTS USING THE KIDS AS A PAWN AGAINST HER HUSBAND. EVERY TIME THEY'D FIGHT - EVEN THE CHEAPEST ARGUMENT - SHE WOULD SAY, "OKAY, THAT'S IT. YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SEE YOUR KIDS AGAIN." Narrator: ACCORDING TO COURTNEY, JONATHAN STARTS USING HER AS A PUNCHING BAG. David: EVERY TIME HE DRANK, HE GOES INTO A RAGE... AND IT SOMETIMES GOT VIOLENT. WHEN HE GOT DRUNK, HE WOULD LOSE IT. HE HIT ME ON MY NOSE AND CAUSED ME TO BLEED. HE'D HIT ME ON THE HEAD. HE'D THROW ME ON THE FLOOR. [ GRUNTS ] IT WAS TERRIBLE. HE REALLY SCARED ME TO DEATH. Narrator: JONATHAN'S FAMILY WATCHES HELPLESSLY ON THEIR VIDEO PHONE. Betsy: TEXTING - SHE WOULD TEXT GUYS HE DIDN'T WANT HER TO. AND SHE WOULD STILL DO IT AND THROW A FIT ANYWAYS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. Interpreter: ONE TIME, I HIT HIM, AND I KNOW IT WAS WRONG, BUT I JUST FELT LIKE HE WAS NAGGING ME OVER AND OVER AND OVER, AND I JUST CONSTANTLY WAS HOLDING IT IN AND HOLDING IT IN. SOME OF IT WAS MY FAULT. SOME OF IT WAS HIS FAULT. RELATIONSHIPS AREN'T PERFECT. WE KNOW THAT. Interpreter #2: SHE WOULD GO, AND SHE WOULD TEXT HER EX-HUSBAND, AND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM IN THEIR MARRIAGE. AND JONATHAN WOULD TELL HER, "PLEASE. WE'RE MARRIED. YOU NEED TO NOT TALK TO YOUR EXES." Narrator: BY FEBRUARY 2011, THE COUPLE DECIDES THEY NEED SOME TIME APART. COURTNEY LETS JONATHAN TAKE LESLIE TO CALIFORNIA TO VISIT HIS FAMILY BUT INSISTS ON KEEPING JULIE. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] WHEN JONATHAN AND LESLIE COME HOME A MONTH LATER, HE'S SHOCKED TO FIND AN EMPTY HOUSE. Interpreter #3: SHE JUST PACKED, AND SHE JUST LEFT. AND THEN WHEN JONATHAN CAME BACK, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, AND SHE IS VERY IMPULSIVE. Narrator: HE TEXTS COURTNEY AND IS TOTALLY BLINDSIDED WHEN SHE TELLS HIM SHE AND JULIE ARE IN FLORIDA, BECAUSE SHE'S GOTTEN BACK TOGETHER WITH NONE OTHER THAN HER EX-HUSBAND, ROBERT. HEARTBROKEN, JONATHAN REACHES OUT TO HIS FRIENDS LISA AND DAVID. I HAD TALKED TO MY HUSBAND AND ASKED HIM IF, YOU KNOW, IF IT WAS OKAY IF HE CAME AND STAYED WITH US UNTIL HE GOT BACK ON HIS FEET. Narrator: DAVID RELUCTANTLY AGREES TO LET JONATHAN AND LESLIE STAY. David: NOW, IF YOU EVER HAD A QUESTION THAT YOU ACTUALLY WISH YOU HAD ANSWERED WITH A "NO," THAT'S THIS TIME. Narrator: COMING UP, DAVID'S WORLD IS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN WHEN HE MAKES A SHOCKING DISCOVERY. Narrator: WHEN JONATHAN LARSEN'S WIFE, COURTNEY, LEAVES HIM FOR HER EX-HUSBAND, HE AND THEIR DAUGHTER LESLIE ARE INVITED TO STAY WITH THEIR FRIENDS DAVID AND LISA WATKINS. BUT DAVID HAS A BAD FEELING ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT. David: JON WAS ALL THE TIME AROUND HER. AND THEY'RE LAUGHING, THEY'RE JOKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE, AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A CONNECTION THERE, AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. THAT'S HOW I WAS IN MY HOUSE. Narrator: A FEW NIGHTS LATER, DAVID SEES A TEXT FROM HIS WIFE TO JONATHAN. WHAT IT SAYS RIPS THEIR RELATIONSHIP WIDE OPEN. David: IT'S LIKE, "SHOULD WE ACTUALLY TELL ANYONE?" AND SHE SAYS, "NO. "LET'S JUST HIDE IT FOR RIGHT NOW "AND SPEND AS MUCH TIME TOGETHER AS WE CAN AND SEE WHERE IT GOES." LISA. WHAT? WHAT IS THIS? WHAT? HE WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SHAKING HIS FIST OVER ME, YELLING AT ME, SCREAMING AT ME. WHY DO YOU HAVE MY PHONE? YOU'VE BEEN DOING A LOT MORE THAN TALKING WITH JONATHAN. WHAT? WE WERE JUST TALKING. David: AND I STARTED QUESTIONING HER. I WAS JUST MAD AS CRAP. NO, SWEETIE, WE WERE JUST JOKING AROUND. NO. YOU CAN'T DENY THIS. THEN SHE TURNED AROUND AND TOLD ME - SHE SAYS, YES, SHE HAS FEELINGS FOR HIM. OH, OKAY. MM-HMM. PLEASE, DAVID. PLEASE - SHUT UP! Narrator: DAVID IS CONVINCED THAT LISA HAS BEEN CHEATING RIGHT UNDER HIS NOSE. DAVID, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? PLEASE! JONATHAN. JONATHAN, WAKE UP! WAKE UP! Lisa: I KNOW HOW MY EX-HUSBAND IS, AND HE GETS VERY, VERY JEALOUS, AND HE HAS A TENDENCY TO ACT BEFORE HE THINKS. I TOLD YOU - I TOLD YOU - OH, MY GOD, DAVID, I TOLD YOU. STOP TALKING TO ME! DAVID. HE SAW THE PHONE. THAT NIGHT'S KIND OF A BLUR. BUT I ASKED BOTH OF THEM TO LEAVE. I'M GONNA ASK ONE MORE TIME - I WANT YOU ALL OUT. PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS. TELL HIM TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, THEN. WE HAVE TO GO. Lisa: I WAS HURT. I WAS SCARED. I WAS SHAKING THE ENTIRE TIME. HE THREW A BUNCH OF MINE AND JON'S STUFF OVER THE PORCH. BOTH OF US WERE CLUELESS ON WHAT TO DO. Narrator: LISA, JONATHAN, AND HIS 3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER LESLIE HEAD TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT. A WEEK LATER, THEY FIND A PLACE TOGETHER, AND, ACCORDING TO LISA, IT'S ONLY THEN THAT SHE AND JONATHAN BECOME MORE THAN FRIENDS. WE HAD KIND OF JOKED ABOUT IT BEFORE, BUT I WAS LIKE, "WELL, I GUESS NOW WE COULD ACTUALLY REALLY DO IT." Narrator: JONATHAN AND LISA FALL DEEPLY IN LOVE. Caleb: WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT HER, HE WAS BACK TO THAT KID THAT WE KNEW - SMILEY, HAPPY. SHE SUPPORTED HIM - SOMETHING THAT COURTNEY NEVER DID FOR HIM. AND I THINK ALL THOSE YEARS OF LACK OF THAT, IT MADE HIM FEEL LIKE LOVE AND LIFE AGAIN. YOU'RE GONNA TELL COURTNEY. Narrator: THE COUPLE IS SURE COURTNEY WON'T REACT WELL WHEN SHE HEARS ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP. TO THEIR SURPRISE, IT BARELY REGISTERS A RESPONSE. HER REACTION WAS VERY MELLOW. SHE DIDN'T REALLY CARE. [ CELLPHONE VIBRATES ] SHE HAD HER EX-HUSBAND. SHE SEEMED TO BE VERY HAPPY WITH HIM. Narrator: BUT IN REALITY, COURTNEY IS FURIOUS. EVEN THOUGH SHE'S THE ONE WHO WALKED OUT ON THEIR MARRIAGE, SHE CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT OF JONATHAN SHACKING UP WITH LISA. Interpreter #3: SHE WAS STUNNED. SHE'S JUST CONCERNED ABOUT HIM BEING IN LOVE WITH LISA. I TOLD HER, "YOU JUST NEED TO LEAVE HIM ALONE. "LET HIM GO. YOU HAVE ROBERT. "YOU DON'T NEED TO GET BACK WITH HIM JUST, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE'S WITH HER." Narrator: COURTNEY CLAIMS THAT, WITHIN A MONTH, ROBERT GOES BACK TO HIS OLD PARTYING WAYS. I FELT LIKE ROBERT CHOSE HIS FRIENDS OVER A RELATIONSHIP AND LOVE. THIS IS A WEAKNESS OF HIS, SO I DECIDED TO LEAVE. ROBERT WOKE UP ONE MORNING, AND COURTNEY WAS GONE. Narrator: ALONE ONCE AGAIN WITH A BABY TO TAKE CARE OF, COURTNEY REACHES OUT TO JONATHAN. Lisa: COURTNEY SAID THAT SHE WAS SCARED, AND SHE NEEDED A PLACE TO GO, AND I WAS LIKE, "WELL, OF COURSE. "YEAH, SHE CAN COME HERE. I MEAN, SHE'S THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILDREN." Narrator: JONATHAN AND LISA AGREE THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE SAKE OF HIS CHILDREN. BUT WHEN COURTNEY MOVES IN, IT QUICKLY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THIS NEW FAMILY DYNAMIC IS DOOMED. I'VE HEARD YOU ACTUALLY DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU AS SOMETHING OF A LOVE TRIANGLE. YEAH. YES. ARE YOU SAYING THAT JONATHAN STILL HAD AFFECTION - THAT HE LOVED LISA? REALLY, I BELIEVE, JONATHAN REALLY LOVED LISA 100%. I THINK HE LOVED ME MAYBE 95%. I THINK HE WANTED ME BACK MAINLY FOR THE CHILDREN. SO I FELT VERY WEIRD. A LOVE TRIANGLE LIKE THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS. Lisa: AND SHE WOULD NOT LET HIM HAVE PRETTY MUCH ANY CONTACT WITH ME. HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO, YOU KNOW, EVEN STEP FOOT IN THE BEDROOM DOOR TO SPEAK TO ME. Narrator: COURTNEY'S ATTITUDE MAKES ALL THREE OF THEM MISERABLE. Lisa: IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO WATCH THEM BE A COUPLE INSIDE THE HOUSE, KNOWING THAT I STILL LOVED HIM AND HE LOVED ME, BUT I KNEW, FOR THE BETTER GOOD, THIS IS WHAT WE HAD TO DO. Dr. Jordan: IT'S REALLY ALMOST AN ACT OF CRUELTY THAT SHE CALLS UP JONATHAN AND WANTS TO MOVE INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HE'S NOW LIVING IN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH LISA. BY INJECTING HERSELF INTO THEIR HOME, SHE SETS UP ALL OF THEM FOR A TOXIC LOVE TRIANGLE IN WHICH THERE CAN BE NO WINNERS. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, JONATHAN AND COURTNEY PACK UP THE KIDS AND HEAD TO CALIFORNIA TO SEE HIS FAMILY. THE COUPLE SPENDS THE ENTIRE TRIP AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS. THEY ARRIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND STAY WITH JONATHAN'S FAMILY. EVEN THOUGH THEY LEFT LISA IN NORTH CAROLINA, COURTNEY IS CONVINCED THAT JONATHAN IS SLIPPING AWAY FROM HER. I ENCOURAGED HIM TO STOP ALL COMMUNICATION WITH LISA, BUT HE WOULDN'T. I WASN'T ALLOWED TO TALK TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS OR MY EXES, SO WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? SHE WOULD SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN, "I KNOW IT. I KNOW HE'S GOING BACK TO LISA." SHE PROBABLY SAID THAT THREE OR FOUR TIMES. Dr. Jordan: WHEN JONATHAN AND COURTNEY GET BACK TO CALIFORNIA, COURTNEY STILL DISTRUSTS HIM, CONVINCED THAT HE STILL HAS LOVE AND AFFECTION FOR LISA. THE TENSION HASN'T DISSIPATED. IT'S ACTUALLY AMPING UP. Narrator: JULY 11, 2011. JONATHAN'S FAMILY AND COURTNEY'S EX DARNELL ARE HANGING OUT WHEN, ONCE AGAIN, COURTNEY AND JONATHAN BATTLE IT OUT. THIS TIME, IT'S OVER A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY, BUT THE FIGHT QUICKLY ESCALATES. BUT JON JUST WENT OFF, AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW, STOP. DON'T FIGHT WITH ME." AND HE GOT MAD, AND HE WANTED TO FIGHT, AND I BACKED OFF, AND I WALKED AWAY, AND I WENT TO THE BATHROOM. Narrator: JONATHAN ALSO WALKS AWAY AND TEXTS LISA. [ CELLPHONE VIBRATES ] HE TELLS HER HE CAN'T STAND BEING AWAY FROM HER AND IS THINKING OF COMING HOME. Lisa: I WAS VERY EMOTIONAL. I WAS VERY UPSET. I JUST WANTED HIM TO COME BACK. I MISSED HIM SO MUCH. AND HE CALMED ME DOWN AGAIN. HE TOLD ME THAT HIS PHONE WAS GETTING READY TO DIE AND THAT HE WOULD TALK TO ME LATER. Narrator: COURTNEY IS ALSO BUSY TEXTING. SHE WAS THERE IN THE RESTROOM FOR A LONG TIME. [ SIGHS ] AND SO JONATHAN WENT TO CHECK ON COURTNEY AND TRIED THE DOORKNOB, AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED. Narrator: COURTNEY DOESN'T HEAR THE FRANTIC BANGING. JONATHAN FEARS THE WORST. DARNELL TRIES TO HELP HIM JIMMY OPEN THE DOOR WITH AN ATM CARD. I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD BE IN THE BATHROOM FOR A LONG TIME. I WAS TEXTING MY FRIENDS. AND I WAS TALKING IN THE BATHROOM, TRYING TO COOL OFF. AND I WASN'T EVEN THINKING HOW LONG I WAS IN THE BATHROOM. Narrator: BY THIS TIME, IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT. DARNELL'S HAD ENOUGH AND GOES HOME. JONATHAN IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH COURTNEY'S ERRATIC BEHAVIOR AND HER PAST SUICIDE ATTEMPT. NOW HE'S PANICKED. ACCORDING TO COURTNEY, HE GRABS A STEAK KNIFE TO JIMMY THE DOOR. Interpreter: AND I WAS JUST IN THE MIRROR, KIND OF THINKING TO MYSELF AND SAYING, "YOU KNOW, I CAN'T LET THIS GO ON. "I REALIZE THAT LISA MAKES HIM HAPPY. I HAVE TO LET IT GO WITH JON, YOU KNOW?" SO I DECIDED THAT THIS WAS IT. I JUST WANTED TO CHANGE FOR MY KIDS. THE PROBLEMS - THEY WEREN'T IMPORTANT. THEY WEREN'T WORTH IT. Narrator: ACCORDING TO COURTNEY, SHE'S COMPLETELY SURPRISED WHEN SHE SEES JONATHAN AT THE DOOR WITH A KNIFE. Interpreter: I FELT WEIRD, LIKE SOMETHING WAS WRONG. HE WAS JUST STANDING THERE. AND SO, IN MY MIND, I'M SAYING, "OKAY. HERE WE GO AGAIN." I WAS NERVOUS. I WAS SCARED. AND HE SAID, "I WANT YOUR PHONE NOW." AND I SAID, "OKAY. I'M JUST GONNA GIVE HIM THE PHONE." HE GRABBED ME AND STARTED SHAKING ME, AND I'M TELLING HIM, "STOP!" I'M SCREAMING. YOU KNOW, I'M SCREAMING FOR HELP, BUT NOBODY'S THERE. HIS FAMILY'S DEAF. I KNEW THAT HE WOULD HIT ME AGAIN, AND SO I WAS SCARED AND FREAKED OUT - YOU KNOW, ALL THE ABUSE. I SAW THE KNIFE. Narrator: AFTER NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF LIES, JEALOUSY, AND ABUSE, COURTNEY AND JONATHAN LARSEN HAVE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT OF NO RETURN IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP. CONVINCED THAT JONATHAN'S WHITE-HOT RAGE IS ABOUT TO TURN DEADLY, COURTNEY GOES ON THE DEFENSIVE. [ GRUNTING ] COURTNEY STABS JONATHAN THREE TIMES. I STABBED HIM. THAT LAST TIME, I SAW HIS FACE. IT WAS JUST LIKE IN SLOW MOTION. I DECIDED THAT I WOULD STAB MYSELF, AND I'LL DIE WITH HIM, AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID I WOULD DIE FOR HIM, TOO, AND HE SAID, "NO." AND THEN, AT THAT POINT, HE COLLAPSED TO HIS KNEES, AND I DROPPED THE KNIFE, AND THEN I RAN. Narrator: COURTNEY FRANTICALLY RUSHES INTO HER MOTHER-IN-LAW'S BEDROOM. SHE HAD BLOOD ALL OVER HER AND ALL OVER ME. AND COURTNEY SAID, "I KILLED YOUR SON. I KILLED YOUR SON!" AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW, CALL 911. WE HAVE TO SAVE HIM." AND THEN I WENT TO THE OPPOSITE HALL IN A CORNER, AND I JUST CRIED AND CRIED. [ CRYING ] Narrator: KELLY LARSEN SEES HER SON LYING BLOODY ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR. Interpreter #2: AND I WAS TRYING TO SHAKE HIM, AND JONATHAN KIND OF LIKE LOOKED UP AT ME. IT LOOKED LIKE HIS EYES WERE GLAZING OVER. Narrator: PANIC-STRICKEN, KELLY RUNS TO HER SON CALEB'S APARTMENT TO GET HIS WIFE, BETSY. BETSY IS A MEDICAL ASSISTANT WHO'S BEEN CALLED FOR HELP BEFORE. I'M THINKING, "OH, GREAT." YOU KNOW, "SOMEONE CUT THEMSELVES, THREW A PLATE, SOMETHING." AS SOON AS I WALK IN, YOU CAN SMELL BLOOD. HE WAS GURGLING 'CAUSE HE WAS DROWNING. OH, MY GOD. [ SOBS ] NO, NO, NO, NO. IT'S OKAY. Narrator: BETSY TAKES JONATHAN IN HER ARMS. AND THEN I JUST TRIED TO COMFORT HIM. I TOLD HIM THAT I LOVED HIM AND THAT I WAS HERE FOR HIM. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. Narrator: CALEB IS STUNNED BY WHAT HE SEES. I WAS LIKE, "WHAT THE **** ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" I WAS LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN COURTNEY STABBED JONATHAN?" AND THEN I-I LOOKED AT JON, AND I SEE HIM, AND THEN I REALIZE IT'S NOT A JOKE. Narrator: WHEN THE PARAMEDICS ARRIVE, THEY TRY TO REVIVE JONATHAN... BUT IT'S TOO LATE. Interpreter #2: BETSY CAME OUT WITH TEARS, AND I WAS JUST RIGHT THERE. I KNEW THAT HE DIDN'T MAKE IT. [ SOBBING ] Betsy: JONATHAN DIED IN MY ARMS. THE LAST THING HE SAID WAS ACTUALLY, "COURTNEY." [ Voice breaking ] IT SOUNDED LIKE, IN HIS VOICE, THAT HE, YOU KNOW, FORGAVE HER. Dr. Jordan: AT THAT EXACT MOMENT, WAS HE ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY ATTACKING YOU, OR WERE YOU JUST AFRAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO ATTACK YOU? I WAS AFRAID THAT HE WOULD ATTACK ME. Kelly: AND I WAS READY TO RUN AND JUST BEAT COURTNEY. I'M SAYING, "I HATE YOU. I HATE YOU. I HATE YOU." [ SOBBING ] AND SHE WAS COVERED IN BLOOD, SAYING, "I KILLED HIM. I KILLED HIM. I KILLED HIM." [ SNIFFLES ] [ SIRENS WAILING ] Narrator: POLICE OFFICERS ARRIVE ON THE SCENE AND ARREST COURTNEY. Officer: MA'AM, I NEED YOU TO GET UP. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] GIVE ME YOUR LEFT HAND. I WAS OUT OF MY MIND. MY THINKING WASN'T STABLE. I WASN'T FOCUSING. SO WHEN THE POLICE OFFICERS GRABBED ME, I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS OVER. Narrator: DOWN AT THE STATION, POLICE CONFIRM THAT JONATHAN IS DEAD. COURTNEY IS CHARGED WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. I WAS SHOCKED. AND I'M SAYING, "NO, NO." BUT I WAS IN SUCH DENIAL, AND I FELT LIKE, "GOD IS NEVER GONNA FORGIVE ME FOR THIS - NEVER." I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE'D DIED. NO! Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING, LISA GETS A CALL FROM JONATHAN'S FAMILY. THE LOVE OF HER LIFE IS NEVER COMING HOME. Lisa: I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER CRIED SO HARD IN MY LIFE. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE THE PERSON I LOVE JUST RIPPED OUT OF MY LIFE THAT WAY. WE WOULD HAVE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP TOGETHER, AND IT WAS STOLEN FROM ME. Narrator: JONATHAN'S FAMILY BELIEVES HE NEVER THREATENED COURTNEY. INSTEAD, THEY SAY SHE KILLED HIM BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T STAND THE THOUGHT OF HIM LEAVING HER. I THINK SHE SAW JON'S FACE, AND SHE KNEW HE WAS HAPPY WITH LISA, AND SHE WAS GONNA BE LEFT IN THE DUST. AND SHE PROBABLY SNAPPED AND KILLED HIM. Narrator: COURTNEY PLEADS GUILTY TO INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER BEFORE HER CASE EVEN GOES TO TRIAL. THE JUDGE SENTENCES HER TO JUST THREE YEARS' PROBATION WITH DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE COUNSELING. THE JUDGE'S THOUGHT PROCESS WOULD INCLUDE CONSIDERING THE HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF COURTNEY AS A DEAF WOMAN IN A HEARING WORLD. THE JUDGE WOULD ALSO REALIZE THAT SHE WOULD GET FAR BETTER SERVICES ON THE OUTSIDE, ON A COMMUNITY-BASED LEVEL THAN IN PRISON. BUT STILL, WITHOUT CLEAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF SELF-DEFENSE, IT'S REALLY AMAZING THAT COURTNEY AVOIDED PRISON ENTIRELY. I FEEL LIKE SHE GOT AWAY WITH MURDER. Narrator: COURTNEY AND JONATHAN'S CHILDREN ARE IN THE CUSTODY OF HER PARENTS, WITH COURTNEY'S OTHER TWO KIDS. THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME ANGRY - MORE ANGRY THAN ANYTHING ELSE - IS THE KIDS ARE GONNA GROW UP WITHOUT A FATHER. Narrator: COURTNEY IS CURRENTLY SERVING HER PROBATION IN RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA. SHE HOPES TO SOMEDAY REGAIN CUSTODY OF HER CHILDREN. I WAS SORRY FOR WHAT I DID. HE DIDN'T DESERVE TO DIE. AND I DO REGRET WHAT HAPPENED, BECAUSE I MADE A MISTAKE. AND I FEEL BAD FOR MY KIDS. I FEEL BAD FOR MY DAUGHTERS NOT HAVING THEIR FATHER. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
