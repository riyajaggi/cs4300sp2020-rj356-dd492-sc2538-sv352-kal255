 IS SHE A HELPLESS VICTIM? I TOLD MYSELF, "WHEN THIS IS OVER, I WILL KILL HIM." OR A COLD-BLOODED KILLER? HELP! NOT ALL FAIRY TALES HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS. WHEN LOVE GOES WRONG, A WOMAN CAN DO THE UNTHINKABLE. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS IN THE LEAFY SUBURB OF OLD BRIDGE, NEW JERSEY, TEENAGER LORI McLUCKIE IS A LONER, AN OUTCAST AT HER CLIQUEY HIGH SCHOOL. AT SCHOOL, I WOULD GO FOR DAYS OR WEEKS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD. DIDN'T GO TO THE PROM. DIDN'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND. DIDN'T GO TO FOOTBALL GAMES, ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

 UNATHLETIC, UNCOORDINATED, REALLY NO SOCIAL SKILLS - THAT'S HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE MYSELF. HER HOME LIFE ISN'T MUCH BETTER. I KNEW LORI WHEN SHE WAS JUST A CHILD. SHE WAS QUIET. SHE WAS SHY. COULD SHE HAVE BEEN A TORTURED SOUL? I SUPPOSE. REALLY SAW NO EVIDENCE OF REAL PROBLEMS WITH HER. HER PARENTS ARE WELL-OFF FINANCIALLY. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO NURTURING LORI, THEY'RE EMOTIONALLY BANKRUPT. HER FATHER WAS VOLATILE AND, AT TIMES, VIOLENT. SO SHE WAS SORT OF FADED INTO THE WALL, YOU KNOW? DO YOU REALLY WANT A DRINK? HER MOTHER WASN'T PARTICULARLY NURTURING. DIDN'T PAY A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION TO HER. LOOKING BACK ON IT, I REMEMBER BEING HUGGED BY HER ONE TIME. I REMEMBER NOT REALLY HAVING FRIENDS. DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. THE ONE SO-CALLED WARNING SIGN YOU MIGHT IDENTIFY IN LORI'S UPBRINGING WOULD BE HER DETACHMENT. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SOCIALLY AWKWARD AND AWARE OF IT, THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ALWAYS OUTSIDE OF THE BUBBLE, ALWAYS WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE INTERACT, ALMOST AS IF THEY ARE A STUDENT OF SOCIETY BUT NOT REALLY PART OF IT, AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A SETUP FOR DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIPS. LORI DREAMS OF ESCAPING HER MISERABLE HOME LIFE. I JUST FELT LIKE I COULD START BEING MYSELF IF I WAS FAR AWAY. THAT'S AS FAR AS I ANALYZED IT. SHE FINALLY GETS HER WISH WHEN SHE GETS ACCEPTED TO A SMALL LIBERAL-ARTS COLLEGE IN OHIO, 600 MILES AWAY. FOR LORI, THE WHOLE IDEA OF GETTING AWAY FROM HER FAMILY WAS THE ONLY HOPE SHE HAD. IT'S NOT THAT SHE HAD GIVEN UP ON LIVING A NORMAL LIFE. IT'S JUST SHE KEPT WAITING FOR THAT MOMENT TO ARRIVE. ONCE LORI ENROLLS, SHE INSTANTLY FEELS AT HOME. I LOVED ANTIOCH. EVERYBODY AT ANTIOCH WAS AN OUTCAST. THAT'S THE KIND OF SCHOOL IT WAS. IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT JUST DIDN'T FIT IN ANYWHERE ELSE. SHE THRIVES AS A STUDENT AND, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE, GETS A BOYFRIEND NAMED DAVID WILSON. EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE FALLING INTO PLACE. GOT A BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE IN LITERATURE. I LOVED IT. IT WAS THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. AFTER GRADUATION, IN THE SUMMER OF 1984, A NEWLY CONFIDENT LORI HEADS TO DENVER, COLORADO, TO GET EVEN FURTHER AWAY FROM HER FAMILY. NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC HAD AN ARTICLE ABOUT DENVER THAT YEAR. IT WAS JULY OF 1984. I JUST THOUGHT, "THIS LOOKS LIKE A GREAT PLACE. I THINK I'M GONNA TRY THIS OUT." THIS IS LORI. HOW MAY I HELP YOU? OKAY. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, LORI SCORES A JOB AT A PUBLISHING COMPANY. SOON, SHE HAS AN APARTMENT, A STEADY INCOME, AND HOPE THAT HER LIFE IS FINALLY ON TRACK. I WAS SO EXCITED TO HAVE A JOB, A REAL JOB WHERE I WAS MAKING JUST ENOUGH TO SUPPORT MYSELF, AND IT WAS PRETTY EXCITING. BUT IN THIS STRANGE NEW ENVIRONMENT, LORI'S SELF-ESTEEM PROBLEM SOMEHOW CREEPS BACK IN. SHE HAS TROUBLE CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE AROUND HER AND ONCE AGAIN FEELS LIKE AN OUTSIDER. SO ROMANTIC HOW HE PROPOSED. DID YOU MAKE SOME FRIENDS? THE PEOPLE AT WORK, I JUST FELT LIKE I WOULD TALK TO PEOPLE AT WORK, BUT THERE WAS NEVER - I JUST COULDN'T FEEL A CONNECTION. HI. I MADE ONE DECENT FRIEND THAT LIVED IN MY BUILDING. I'M FRANK, AND WE LIVE RIGHT HERE IF WE CAN EVER HELP YOU OUT WITH ANYTHING. UH, LORI. HE WAS ACTUALLY AN EX-MARINE. HE WAS 20 YEARS OLDER THAN ME, AND HE WAS ACTUALLY THE MORE SETTLED OF MOST PEOPLE I KNEW. DESPITE FEELING SOCIALLY AWKWARD, LORI'S DESPERATE FOR COMPANY. AND SHE FINDS IT IN THE STRANGEST OF PLACES. I HAVE MONEY. YOU GOT ONE DOLLAR. THIS IS KIND OF EMBARRASSING, BUT I JUST STARTED HANGING AROUND WITH STREET PEOPLE. ANYONE TELL YOU YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY? YEAH? THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS SHE'S NOT A GREAT JUDGE OF CHARACTER. THE STEPS THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO THROUGH IN THEIR EARLY ADOLESCENCE, LEARNING HOW TO JUDGE WHO THEIR FRIENDS ARE, MAKE FRIENDS CAREFULLY, GET OUT OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT DON'T FEEL GOOD, LORI SKIPPED ALL OF THAT. SHE'S ALL RIGHT, MAN. THEN HER NEED FOR COMPANIONSHIP TAKES AN EVEN WEIRDER, RISKIER TURN. LORI STARTS DATING THE MEN SHE MEETS ON THE STREET. YOU CAN STAY WHENEVER YOU WANT. PEOPLE THAT I DATED WERE LOSERS, LIKE THESE STREET PEOPLE. THEY SEEMED EXOTIC TO ME. I JUST FOUND THAT REALLY INTERESTING. THEN WE HITCHHIKED DOWN TO MEXICO. EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS COLLEGE-EDUCATED AND COULD HAVE LIVED IN THE SUBURBS, THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE CHOSE TO DO. THAT WAS NOT WHY SHE CAME TO COLORADO. IT WAS A CULTURE OF PEOPLE THAT SHE WAS DRAWN TO THAT WERE MORE WHAT I DESCRIBED AS BIKER TYPES. ONE OF THE MEN SHE BEGINS TO DATE IS ARTHUR JOHNSON. HE HAD ALL THESE STORIES ABOUT HIS TRAVELS, AND I JUST FOUND THAT REALLY EXOTIC. HE DIDN'T SEEM MENTALLY ILL TO ME AT THE TIME. HE SEEMED VERY INTELLIGENT. ARTHUR BECOMES A REGULAR VISITOR AT HER APARTMENT. HOW YOU DOING THERE, BABE? JUST SEEMED LIKE THAT'S WHO I COULD RELATE TO. BUT ACCORDING TO LORI, ONE NIGHT HE COMES OVER DRUNK AND GETS EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE. LOOKING GOOD AS USUAL, BABE. NOW, LOOKING BACK, OBVIOUSLY, HE WASN'T STABLE AT ALL. NO, I THINK MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST GO. NO, HEY, LOOK! ARTHUR? LISTEN! IT'S ME! HE BECAME VERY DRUNK AND STARTED BEATING ME UP. LORI CLAIMS THAT BY THE TIME SHE REALIZES SHE'S IN SERIOUS DANGER, IT'S TOO LATE. HE BASICALLY HELD ME CAPTIVE IN MY APARTMENT FOR, IF I REMEMBER, OVER THREE HOURS. KEPT ME FROM GOING TO WORK. SHE SAYS ARTHUR RAPED AND BRUTALIZED HER. ONCE ARTHUR FINALLY TAKES OFF, A BATTERED AND FRIGHTENED LORI RUNS TO THE ONLY FRIEND SHE HAS - HER NEIGHBOR FRANK. LORI, WHAT - WHAT HAPPENED? I DIDN'T THINK OF IT AT FIRST AS RAPE BECAUSE I HAD HAD CONSENSUAL RELATIONS WITH HIM IN THE PAST. HE WAS IN MY HOME. KICKING ME... LORI ENDS UP TELLING FRANK THE WHOLE STORY. HE MADE ME CALL THE POLICE. THE NEXT THING I KNEW, I'M AT THE HOSPITAL. I'M GETTING POKED AND PRODDED AND PHOTOGRAPHED. DID YOU GET PUNCHED IN THE MOUTH, LORI? SHE DOESN'T HAVE CONTEXT TO INTERPRET WHAT EXACTLY HAS HAPPENED. WHICH IS RIGHT - THE MAN WHO SAYS THAT THE SEX WAS CONSENSUAL, OR THE FRIEND WHO SAYS, "BASED ON THE STORY YOU TOLD ME, YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY RAPED"? PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK. WHAT FOR? WHAT DID I DO, MAN? A FEW DAYS LATER, THE COPS PICK UP ARTHUR. HE'S CHARGED WITH ASSAULT AND RAPE. SO BY THAT, YOU MEAN YOU WERE HAVING CONSENSUAL SEX? YES. MONTHS LATER, THE CASE GOES TO TRIAL. AND A TERRIFIED LORI TAKES THE STAND. MISS McLUCKIE, WAS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH MY CLIENT? NO. I FELT COMPLETELY HUMILIATED. THEY ACCUSED ME OF LYING. YOU'VE DONE THIS SORT OF THING IN THE PAST, RIGHT? YES. THEY ASKED VERY DETAILED QUESTIONS. HOW FREQUENTLY? YOU - WASN'T THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU ENJOYED? NO. IT WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING. LORI SOMEHOW HOLDS IT TOGETHER IN COURT BY BURYING HER EMOTIONS. HE THREW ME ON THE GROUND. WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH ALL OF THE EMOTIONS ABOUT THIS MAN WHO RAPED YOU? I WAS JUST SO EMBARRASSED. I WENT NUMB A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE TELLING THESE THINGS ON THE STAND. ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU'RE LYING HERE TODAY? WHO WILL THE JURY BELIEVE? COMING UP, LORI FINALLY LANDS THE BOYFRIEND SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED, BUT IS HE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE? I FELT AT THE TIME LIKE I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM. 23-YEAR-OLD LORI McLUCKIE HAS ACCUSED A MAN SHE WAS DATING, ARTHUR JOHNSON, OF RAPE. SHE SHOWS LITTLE EMOTION WHILE TESTIFYING AT HIS TRIAL. NO. ULTIMATELY, LORI'S DETACHED MANNER BACKFIRES. THEIR THEORY OF THE CASE WAS THAT I MADE THIS UP BECAUSE I NEEDED AN EXCUSE FOR WHY I DIDN'T GO TO WORK THAT DAY. THE JURY ACQUITS HER ALLEGED ATTACKER OF ALL CHARGES. HE HAD BEEN FOUND NOT GUILTY BECAUSE THE JURY DIDN'T BELIEVE HER. LORI HAD DONE THE BEST TO TELL HER STORY, BUT HER ABILITY TO EFFUSIVELY SHOW EMOTION HAD NEVER EXISTED. IN LORI'S MIND, HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT TO ME, THAT SHE FELT THAT THE SYSTEM FAILED HER AND SHE DESERVED THAT. FOR THIS LONELY AND EMOTIONALLY FRAGILE YOUNG WOMAN, IT'S A DEVASTATING BLOW. LORI DOES WHAT SHE'S ALWAYS DONE. SHE STUFFS IT DOWN AND BASICALLY LEAVES IT TO SMOLDER UNTIL IT MAY FLARE UP AGAIN. LORI STRUGGLES TO COPE WITH THE JURY'S RULING. I JUST REMEMBER JUST GOING A LITTLE WILD AND DATING A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT MEN. IT SEEMED LIKE DATING MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE HELPED ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF. A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER THE TRIAL, LORI IS WALKING HOME FROM WORK WHEN SHE'S APPROACHED BY A YOUNG MAN. EXCUSE ME. DO YOU HAVE THE TIME? HIS NAME IS ANDREW VIGIL. I DON'T WEAR A WATCH. HE STARTED A CONVERSATION. I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID. I'M NOT FROM AROUND HERE. SURE. COOL. THANKS. LORI'S DRAWN TO ANDREW'S APPARENTLY SWEET, SIMPLE NATURE. THE TWO IMMEDIATELY HIT IT OFF. AND WITHIN DAYS, THEY'RE INSEPARABLE. HE WAS VERY GOOD-LOOKING TO ME. HE HAD A VERY GENTLE SIDE. ANDREW IS EXCITED TO INTRODUCE LORI TO HIS FOSTER FAMILY. ANDY CAME TO US WHEN HE WAS 4 YEARS OLD. HE WAS A CUTE LITTLE BOY. HE TOLD ME HE MET A NICE GIRL AND WANTED TO KNOW IF HE COULD BRING LORI OVER TO VISIT US, AND I SAID SURE. SHE MIGHT BE THE ONE. BUT ANDREW AND LORI HAVE LITTLE IN COMMON AND, TO OUTSIDERS, SEEM LIKE AN UNLIKELY PAIR. HE WENT TO A SPECIAL SCHOOL FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. PEOPLE REFERRED TO HIM AS "SLOW." IN FACT, WE COULDN'T EVEN FIND THAT HE'D EVER HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN BEFORE. I JUST THINK LORI DOESN'T BELIEVE SHE HAS ANY SELF-WORTH. I THINK LORI BELIEVED THAT THAT WAS THE BEST RELATIONSHIP SHE COULD HAVE. AT FIRST GLANCE, YOU MIGHT THINK THAT LORI SEES THIS, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE TRAGEDY OF THE RAPE TRIAL, TO BE THE KIND OF MAN SHE COULD HAVE POWER OVER. SHE COULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, AND THIS MAN COULD NEVER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER. WAS IT A POWER PLAY ON LORI'S PART? NOT REALLY. LORI DIDN'T THINK THAT AS THE UGLY DUCKLING, SHE COULD EVER DO BETTER THAN THIS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE, LORI THINKS SHE HAS A REAL AND LOVING RELATIONSHIP. HEY, BABE, LOOK WHAT I BROUGHT. SOON, ANDREW IS BASICALLY LIVING AT HER APARTMENT. WE NEVER AGREED TO LIVE TOGETHER. I NEVER INVITED HIM TO COME MOVE IN WITH ME. HE JUST KIND OF INSINUATED HIMSELF INTO MY HOME. EVERY TIME HE CAME OVER, HE'D BRING A FEW MORE THINGS, A FEW MORE THINGS, AND THEN HE JUST BASICALLY NEVER LEFT. YOU LOVED HIM, RIGHT? MM... LOOKING BACK, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS, BUT I FELT AT THE TIME LIKE I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM, YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S TIME TO GO. BUT ANDREW'S FAMILY SEES ISSUES WITH THE RELATIONSHIP EARLY ON. HIS FAMILY DESCRIBED IT AS ABUSIVE. SHE WOULD ABUSE HIM ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS AT FAMILY FUNCTIONS. COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHEN I FIRST MET HER WHY SHE WOULD WANT TO BE WITH ANDY BECAUSE HE WAS SO FAR BELOW HER. BUT MAYBE IT WAS THAT SHE COULD CONTROL HIM BECAUSE HE WASN'T AS SMART AS SHE WAS. HE ADORED HER, AND HE PUT UP WITH A LOT OF ABUSE FROM HER AS A RESULT. FINE. I'LL GO TELL THEM THAT WE'RE LEAVING. HEY. I'M OFF. ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO MAYBE FILL OUT SOME MORE JOB APPLICATIONS TODAY? AS THE WEEKS PASS, LORI REALIZES THAT ANDREW IS CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED... CAN YOU PICK UP SOME MORE SMOKES BEFORE YOU COME BACK? ...AND NOT THAT MOTIVATED TO LOOK FOR WORK. HE DID LIVE ON THE STREETS FOR ABOUT A YEAR BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO WORK. OH, HEY. WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY? OH, YOU KNOW, THIS AND THAT. LORI'S FORCED TO SUPPORT THEM BOTH ON HER MEAGER SALARY. HOW DID THE JOB HUNT GO? YOU KNOW, I'LL GET TO IT TOMORROW. STILL, EVEN THOUGH ANDREW'S NOT PULLING HIS WEIGHT, HE DOES GIVE LORI THE LOVE AND ATTENTION SHE CRAVES. WHEN I FIRST MET HIM, HE DID NOT HAVE A JOB AT ALL. OCCASIONALLY, HE'D GO OUT ON DAY LABOR AND MAKE A LITTLE MONEY. LATER ON, HE STARTED WORKING AT WOOLWORTH'S AS A DISHWASHER. BUT TO THE OUTSIDE PERSON, THEY'RE GONNA SAY, "LORI, LOOK AT YOU. "YOU'RE EMPLOYED. YOU'RE COLLEGE EDUCATED. "YOU'RE SUPER SMART. "WHY WOULD YOU DATE A DISHWASHER AT WOOLWORTH'S THAT YOU MET ON THE STREET?" I DIDN'T SEE IT LIKE THAT. I FELT LIKE I WAS VERY UGLY. MY SELF-IMAGE WAS NOT GOOD. I DIDN'T SEE MYSELF AS, "OH, HERE'S THIS PERSON THAT'S MAKING A SUCCESS OF THEIR LIFE." I FELT JUST UGLY. LORI'S IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S BECOME EXPLOITATIVE, AND YET SHE DOESN'T SEE IT AS SUCH. HE SLEEPS AT HER HOUSE. THEY SEEM TO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. MAYBE SHE'S PAYING FOR EVERYTHING, BUT AGAIN, SHE'S GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF IT, TOO - THE IDEA THAT FINALLY, IN HER 20s, SHE COULD HAVE A BOYFRIEND AND MAKE A GO OF IT. LORI! BUT THINGS ARE ABOUT TO TAKE AN UGLY TURN. LORI, GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE. LORI CLAIMS THAT ONE NIGHT, ANDREW SHOWS UP AT HER APARTMENT, WASTED, AND HE'S NOT A HAPPY DRUNK. AM I OKAY?! DO YOU THINK I'M **** OKAY?! WHEN HE DID DRINK, IT WAS ALWAYS OVER THE TOP. COMING UP... WHO IS APRIL? ANDREW'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A TEMPER. LORI, YOU'RE RIDICULOUS! NO! SHE WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT ANDREW VIGIL WAS HAVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER WOMEN. 24-YEAR-OLD LORI McLUCKIE IS TWO MONTHS INTO WHAT SHE FEELS IS THE ONLY REALLY LOVING RELATIONSHIP SHE'S EVER KNOWN. GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE! BUT LORI'S JUST SEEN A SIDE OF ANDREW THAT CHANGES HER PERSPECTIVE. WHEN HE WAS DRUNK, HE WAS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. I TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSE! ACCORDING TO LORI, AFTER A DESTRUCTIVE, DRUNKEN RANT IN HER APARTMENT, ANDREW FINALLY PASSES OUT. SHE'S RELIEVED. THE NEXT MORNING, SHE CONFRONTS HIM ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR. YOU WERE REALLY SCARY. I KNOW. I'M SORRY. HE APOLOGIZES AND SHIFTS THE BLAME TO HIS TERRIBLE CHILDHOOD. WHEN HE WAS 4 YEARS OLD, HIS MOTHER WAS BLUDGEONED TO DEATH BY HER BOYFRIEND IN FRONT OF ANDREW AND HIS THREE SIBLINGS. HE BELIEVED THAT HIS MOTHER DESERVED WHAT SHE GOT. HE SAID THAT SHE WAS VERY ABUSIVE TO HIM. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT. THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD ME. LORI IS MOVED BY ANDREW'S STARTLING ADMISSION. SHE CAN RELATE TO THE PAIN HE FELT GROWING UP AND SEES A COMMON BOND BETWEEN THEM. I REALLY LOVE YOU. WHILE THE TRAUMA OF THEIR YOUTH MAY BE DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF EXPERIENCE, THIS GUY APPEARS TO BE HER MIRROR IMAGE IN TERMS OF HAVING A DAMAGED SOUL. AND LORI BELIEVED THAT IF SHE COULD JUST MAKE HIM GET A JOB, PERHAPS THEY COULD GET ON THE SAME LEVEL. AND THE MAGIC OF THAT RELATIONSHIP COULD CONTINUE. AFTER A YEAR OF DATING, ANDREW FINALLY GETS A STEADY JOB AS A DISHWASHER AT WOOLWORTH'S AND RENTS HIS OWN PLACE. THIS RELIEVES SOME FINANCIAL PRESSURE, BUT LORI IS STILL UNHAPPY WITH ANDREW. WHO IS APRIL? SHE WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT ANDREW VIGIL WAS HAVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER WOMEN. I JUST TOLD YOU. HE WAS THERE, TRYING TO DO HIS JOB, AND THEY GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION THERE. YOU NEED TO STOP. THE ARGUMENT ESCALATES TO THE POINT WHERE ANDREW'S BOSS HAS TO BREAK IT UP. ANDY, TIME TO GO TO WORK. BREAK TIME'S OVER. DESPITE THE FIGHTING, LORI HOLDS ONTO THE HOPE THAT ANDREW WILL CHANGE AND THEY CAN SAVE THE RELATIONSHIP. BUT AS THE WEEKS PASS, LORI CLAIMS ANDREW'S DRUNKEN TIRADES BECOME MORE FREQUENT... YOU ARE NOTHING! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? ...AND MORE AGGRESSIVE. LORI, MY STUFF. LORI, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT OF THE WAY. I JUST NEED A BEER, DAMN IT. GET ME A BEER! LORI'S TOLERANCE OF ANDREW'S ABUSE PUTS HER IN DANGER - NOT SO MUCH PHYSICALLY AS EMOTIONALLY. GET BACK HERE! HER FANTASY OF BEING A NORMAL WOMAN IN A NORMAL RELATIONSHIP WAS EVERYTHING TO LORI. SORRY I GOT YOU SO MAD. ALL SHE EVER WANTED WAS TO FEEL LOVED, AND WHEN SHE STARTED TO EQUATE ANDREW'S BEHAVIORS, HIS CONTROL, HIS ANGER FOLLOWED BY HIS MAKING UP WITH LOVE, THERE WAS NO WAY SHE WAS GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP EASILY. AT LEAST WHEN I WAS WITH HIM, I DIDN'T HAVE THAT SENSE OF I WAS JUST GONNA TOTALLY FALL PART. ALTHOUGH SHE'S STILL AFRAID OF BEING ALONE, LORI FINALLY MAKES A PAINFUL DECISION. AND AT THIS POINT, I WAS ACTUALLY STARTING TO REALLY HATE HIM. IT'S TIME TO DROP ANDREW FOR GOOD. I WAS THINKING WE COULD TALK. I THOUGHT, "OKAY, WELL, MAYBE I CAN DO THIS," YOU KNOW? ABOUT WHAT? BUT WHEN THE MOMENT COMES TO DROP THE BOMBSHELL... SAY IT. WHAT? ...LORI CHICKENS OUT. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT - NOTHING IMPORTANT. I WOULD START TO FEEL MORE NORMAL AND THEN HE WOULD KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THROW ME OFF MY FEET AGAIN. BUT ANDREW'S FOSTER MOTHER TELLS A DIFFERENT STORY. SHE SAYS ANDREW WAS THE ONE WHO WANTED TO END THE RELATIONSHIP. HE'D TRY TO BREAK UP WITH HER, BUT SHE WOULD ALWAYS CALL HIM BACK. THERE JUST WAS A LOT OF ANIMOSITY BETWEEN THEM. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY ANDY STAYED WITH HER. I TRIED TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT ALL THE TIME, BUT MOMS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. I WANT TO TALK TO ANDY. HE'D SAY, "OH, MOM, "I DON'T WANT TO BREAK UP WITH LORI. SHE REALLY LOVES ME." AND I'D SAY, "YEAH, ANDY, I KNOW. SHE'LL LOVE YOU TO DEATH." EVEN AFTER LOSING THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT AND DUMP ANDREW, LORI CLAIMS SHE STILL WANTS OUT. ONE DAY, AFTER 18 MONTHS TOGETHER, SHE PACKS UP ANDREW'S REMAINING BELONGINGS AND LEAVES THEM OUTSIDE HER LOCKED FRONT DOOR. LORI. OPEN THE **** DOOR! LORI STAYS STRONG AND WAITS UNTIL ANDREW FINALLY LEAVES. SHE'S HOPEFUL THAT SHE CAN MAKE IT ON HER OWN. HI, DAVID? DESPERATE FOR ANY KIND OF HUMAN CONTACT, LORI DECIDES TO REACH OUT TO HER OLD COLLEGE BOYFRIEND, DAVID WILSON. ...IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO COME AND SEE DENVER? WERE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS BECAUSE YOU WERE BROKEN UP WITH ANDY? YEAH, HERE'S AN OLD FRIEND, AN OLD BOYFRIEND, AND SOMEBODY FROM MY OLD DAYS. DO YOU WANT TO GRAB A COFFEE OR...? YEAH, DEFINITELY. OKAY. WE DID SLEEP TOGETHER, BUT WE HAD GROWN IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. I WAS PROBABLY SO TENSE AND SO MESSED UP THAT I PROBABLY WASN'T AT ALL THE PERSON THAT HE KNEW FROM BEFORE. IT WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF FUN. IT WASN'T WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE. AFTER DAVID HEADS BACK HOME, LORI TRIES TO MOVE ON INDEPENDENTLY. HELLO? BUT THEN SHE GETS A SHOCKING PHONE CALL THAT THREATENS TO CHANGE EVERYTHING. WHAT? COMING UP, ANDREW'S BACK. AND HE'S ANGRIER THAN EVER. I TOLD MYSELF, "WHEN THIS IS OVER, I WILL KILL HIM." LORI McLUCKIE'S JUST HAD A DISAPPOINTING REUNION WITH AN OLD COLLEGE FLAME, DAVID WILSON. NOW, HE'S LEFT DENVER AND GONE BACK TO THE EAST COAST. HELLO? TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, HER PHONE'S JUST RUNG WITH LIFE-CHANGING NEWS. WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED WAS I ACTUALLY HAD GONE TO BE PUT ON BIRTH-CONTROL PILLS. AND AS A PRECURSOR FOR THAT, THEY JUST ROUTINELY DO A PREGNANCY TEST. THE DOCTOR CALLED ME AT HOME AND SAID, "YOU CAN'T GO ON BIRTH CONTROL. YOU'RE PREGNANT." IT FLOORED ME. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. SINGLE, FRIENDLESS, AND TWO MONTHS PREGNANT, LORI IS DETERMINED TO KEEP HER BABY. HER UNBORN CHILD IS ALL SHE HAS. DAVID, IT'S LORI. SHE DECIDES TO CALL DAVID TO BREAK THE NEWS. YES, I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU. OH, MY GOD. WOW. I GUESS I KIND OF THOUGHT THAT... NOT THAT WE WOULD GET MARRIED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT THAT HE WOULD HELP ME OUT A LITTLE BIT. I SPOKE TO THE DOCTOR, YES. ARE YOU SURE IT'S EVEN MY KID? WHAT HE DID WAS TELL ME, "THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN." I CAN PAY FOR HALF THE ABORTION. "IF YOU REFUSE TO HAVE AN ABORTION, I'M WASHING MY HANDS OF THIS." AND I SAID... I DON'T HAVE ANYONE. LISTEN, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE KID, THAT'S YOUR DECISION, ALL RIGHT? But that's not something that I want in my life. I REMEMBER HOW I FELT - LIKE I'D JUST BEEN KICKED IN THE GUT. SO, YOU'RE PREGNANT, BUT WHO COMES KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR? ANDREW. HI. COME IN. THREE DAYS LATER, LORI'S EX-BOYFRIEND ANDREW SHOWS UP AT HER APARTMENT, BEGGING TO GET BACK TOGETHER. SORRY ABOUT... LORI IS SHAKEN AND VULNERABLE. I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. HOW DOES ANDY FIND OUT THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT? I TOLD HIM. EVEN THOUGH LORI TELLS ANDREW THE BABY'S NOT HIS, HE TAKES THE NEWS SURPRISINGLY WELL. IT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE BROKEN UP, SO... HE RECOGNIZES THAT THIS BABY IS HIS TICKET BACK INTO LORI'S LIFE, AND SHE AGREES TO TAKE HIM BACK. HE STARTED BEING REALLY NICE FOR A WHILE. AT THAT TIME, IT WAS ACTUALLY, IRONICALLY ENOUGH, GOOD FOR JUST A SHORT MINUTE. WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS GONNA HAVE A BABY, I SAID, "IS IT YOUR BABY?" AND HE SAID, "NO, IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S, BUT THAT'S OKAY, MOM." YOU KNOW, HE REALLY LOVED HER. EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S KID, HE STILL LOVED HER. FOR THE BABY. YOU GOT THIS FOR THE BABY? HE WAS USING HIS MINIMUM-WAGE SALARY AS A DISHWASHER AT A WOOLWORTH'S TO PURCHASE ITEMS THAT SHE WOULD NEED ONCE THE BABY WAS BORN. HEY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? BUT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, LORI CLAIMS ANDREW'S OLD PATTERNS RETURN - MOMENTS OF SWEETNESS FOLLOWED BY OUTBURSTS OF DRUNKEN VIOLENCE. YOU THINK I'M MAD THAT YOU SLEPT WITH ANOTHER GUY? HUH? HE NEVER ACTUALLY HIT ME HERE WHEN I WAS PREGNANT. BUT HE WOULD OFTEN THREATEN TO. HE'D SAY, "I'M GONNA KILL THAT BABY." SOMETIMES, HE'D LAUGH, AND HE'D SAY, "DID I SCARE YOU?" ANDY! HE'D LAUGH. HE WOULD THINK IT WAS FUNNY. I THINK HE ENJOYED IT. LORI HATES HERSELF FOR LETTING ANDREW BACK IN, AND SHE HAS NO ONE TO TURN TO. I THINK THAT IF SHE PACKED HER BAGS AND LEFT COLORADO AND WENT BACK HOME, HER FAMILY WOULD HAVE CAPITALIZED ON THE FACT THAT SHE WAS A FAILURE. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, ACCORDING TO LORI, SHE BEGINS FEARING FOR HER LIFE AND THE LIFE OF HER CHILD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING? BABE, YOU'RE DRUNK. YOU'RE GONNA CUT YOURSELF. ONE PARTICULAR INCIDENT WILL HAUNT LORI FOREVER. SHE CLAIMED THAT WHEN HE WAS DRUNK, HE WAS ABUSIVE. WHEN HE WASN'T DRUNK, HE WAS FINE. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA CUT YOUR FINGER. DON'T PATRONIZE ME. I GOT IT. ONE DAY, WHEN HE WAS REALLY DRUNK AND HE ACTUALLY HAD ME CORNERED WITH THIS KNIFE... I GOT IT, I SAID! FOR LORI, BEING THREATENED WITH A WEAPON CROSSES A FRIGHTENING NEW LINE. SHE INDICATED THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO FLEE THE APARTMENT, GO DOWN TO A LAUNDRY ROOM WHICH HAD A LOCK. LORI STARTS IMAGINING WAYS TO BREAK AWAY FROM HER VIOLENT BOYFRIEND PERMANENTLY. I STARTED FANTASIZING ABOUT HIM HAVING A FATAL ACCIDENT. I WOULD ACTUALLY THINK LIKE, IF HE WAS LATE COMING OVER OR WHATEVER, I'D THINK, "OH, MAYBE IT HAPPENED. MAYBE HE GOT HIT BY A CAR ON HIS BICYCLE." SOMETIMES, I WOULD ACTUALLY CONVINCE MYSELF THAT IT REALLY HAD HAPPENED, AND THEN HE'D SHOW UP AGAIN. THEN I STARTED THINKING, "WELL, MAYBE I CAN KILL HIM." I STARTED FANTASIZING ABOUT KILLING HIM. THERE HAD TO BE SOME KIND OF END TO THIS IN SOME WAY. THAT DAY WOULD COME ON MAY 22, 1988. THREE MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE LORI AND ANDREW GOT BACK TOGETHER. CHANGE IT. NEXT. I'M WATCHING THIS. SHE'S STILL CLINGING TO THEIR RELATIONSHIP. GIVE ME THE REMOTE, LORI. OW. ACCORDING TO LORI, ANDREW'S BEEN DRINKING FOR HOURS AND IS LOOKING FOR A FIGHT. OW, ANDY. THAT DOESN'T HURT. SHE REACHES HER BREAKING POINT. HE HAD A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, AND HE KEPT DRINKING FROM THAT AND GETTING DRUNKER TO THE POINT WHERE HE WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF IT. OW! LORI IS NOW FIVE MONTHS PREGNANT AND CLAIMS SHE'S TERRIFIED FOR HER AND HER BABY'S SAFETY. SHE GATHERS UP ANDREW'S STUFF, HOPING HE'LL LEAVE. BUT INSTEAD, SHE CLAIMS, ANDREW LASHES OUT. SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME! NO, NO, NO, NO. THE BABY. THAT BABY'S NOT MINE! WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS HURTING THE BABY, HE DIDN'T CARE. PLEASE. WHEN I LOOKED IN HIS FACE, IT WAS LIKE HE WASN'T - THERE WASN'T EVEN A PERSON IN THERE. IT WAS LIKE A MACHINE. HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING OR WHO I WAS. STAY STILL, LORI! THEN, ACCORDING TO LORI, ANDREW DOES THE UNTHINKABLE. NO, NO. HE RAPES HER. WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND, LORI? I TOLD MYSELF, "WHEN THIS IS OVER, I WILL KILL HIM. I WILL FIND A WAY TO KILL HIM." LORI CLAIMS THE ATTACK LASTS FOR OVER AN HOUR. BUT AUTHORITIES SAY THERE'S NO PROOF THE ATTACK EVER HAPPENED. SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO BRUISING. SHE HAD NO BLACK EYES. SHE HAD NO SCRATCH MARKS. IF ANDREW VIGIL WAS PHYSICALLY ATTACKING HER LIKE SHE CLAIMED, THEN HE WOULD HAVE HAD SOME WOUNDS ON THE FRONT PART OF HIS BODY. BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE WOUND ON THE FRONT PART OF HIS BODY. AFTER THE ALLEGED ATTACK, LORI SAYS THAT ANDREW FURIOUSLY PACES AROUND THE ROOM. SHE EYES THE HANDCUFFS HE ALWAYS CARRIES IN HIS POCKET. HE DIDN'T DRIVE. HE RODE A BIKE AROUND DENVER. HE WOULD USE THE HANDCUFFS TO LOCK HIS BIKE TO A BIKE RACK. LORI SAYS SHE COMES UP WITH A DESPERATE PLAN. HE STARTED PASSING OUT, WAKING UP, PASSING OUT, WAKING UP, AND I THOUGHT, "WHEN HE PASSES OUT, I'M GOING TO RESTRAIN HIM, AND THEN I'M GONNA KILL HIM." FINALLY, LORI SEES HER CHANCE AND MAKES HER MOVE. I DRAGGED HIM OVER TO THE RADIATOR AND HANDCUFFED HIM TO THE RADIATOR. WITH HIS OWN HANDCUFFS. YEAH. AND I'D LIKE TO ASK HER THAT ONE QUESTION - WHEN SHE HANDCUFFED HIM TO THE RADIATOR, HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HER. WHY DIDN'T SHE CALL THE POLICE AND SAY HE WAS ABUSING HER? WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE IS DIAL 911 SO THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN HIM INTO CUSTODY FOR SEXUALLY ASSAULTING HER AND FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. LORI SAYS SHE DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE BECAUSE NO ONE BELIEVED HER THE LAST TIME SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME, I ABSOLUTELY WANTED TO KILL HIM RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THEN. THIS TIME, SHE TAKES MATTERS INTO HER OWN HANDS. I GOT A CLOTH BELT, AND I TRIED TO STRANGLE HIM. HE WOKE UP, AND HE STARTED SCREAMING. I JUST WANTED HIM TO STOP SCREAMING, SO I WENT INTO MY KITCHEN. HELP! AFTER HER BOYFRIEND ALLEGEDLY RAPES HER, A FIVE-MONTH PREGNANT LORI McLUCKIE CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE. SHE'S COMMITTED TO GETTING RID OF HER BOYFRIEND, ANDREW, ONCE AND FOR ALL. HELP! I THOUGHT, "I'LL KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD WITH THE HAMMER "AND JUST KNOCK HIM UNCONSCIOUS, AND THEN I'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO FROM THERE." AS ANDREW STRUGGLES TO BREAK FREE, SHE STEELS HERSELF. HELP! HELP! THERE'S NO TURNING BACK. I HIT HIM IN THE HEAD, AND HE JUST KEPT SCREAMING. DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU TO JUST FREE HIM AND DRAG HIM OUTSIDE AND LET HIM GO HOME ON HIS OWN? NO, I FELT LIKE IF I FREED HIM, HE WOULD KILL ME. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE, AND I JUST WANTED IT TO END, AND SO I WENT AND GOT THE KNIFE. AS LORI STANDS OVER HER SEMI-CONSCIOUS BOYFRIEND, IMAGES PLAY LIKE A HOME MOVIE IN HER MIND. ALL THE BRUTALITY, DEGRADATION AND ABUSE SHE SAYS SHE SUFFERED THROUGHOUT HER LIFE COME FLOODING BACK. AND SHE ERUPTS. I JUST STARTED STABBING HIM. IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS STILL SCREAMING FOR A LONG TIME. HOW MANY TIMES? THEY SAID IT WAS 26 STAB WOUNDS. BUT I STILL FELT LIKE HE WASN'T DEAD. I GUESS - LATER, I FOUND OUT MOST OF THEM WERE POSTMORTEM. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WAS GOING ON IN YOUR MIND? I JUST WANTED QUIET. MAYBE IT WAS ME SCREAMING. I DON'T KNOW. LORI IS DAZED AND SPLATTERED WITH ANDREW'S BLOOD. I DON'T REMEMBER PANIC, BUT I REMEMBER THINKING, "OH, MY GOD. "WHAT DO I DO NOW? OH, MY GOD. I AM A MURDERER." AFTER 20-ODD BLOWS WITH THE HAMMER AND MORE THAN 20 STABS WITH THE KNIFE, SHE COULD STILL HEAR THE SCREAMING OF ANDREW. IT REALLY SHOWS IN MY MIND THAT SHE WAS IN A PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE WHERE IT WAS REALLY DISSOCIATIVE, BUT IT WAS SORT OF LIKE AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE. OTHERWISE, THE OVERKILL WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE. IT WASN'T THAT SHE WAS RATCHETING UP WITH RAGE SO MUCH AS DECOMPENSATING WITH THE RESIGNATION THAT WHAT SHE HAD STARTED, SHE HAD TO FINISH. LORI PASSES OUT ON HER BED, EXHAUSTED. HER DEAD BOYFRIEND LIES IN THE NEXT ROOM, CHAINED TO THE RADIATOR. I WOKE UP. AND I THOUGHT, "DID THAT REALLY HAPPEN?" AND I WENT, AND I LOOKED, AND HE WAS IN THERE. THE GRUESOME SCENE JOLTS LORI BACK TO REALITY. SHE NEEDS TO GET RID OF THE BODY. SHE BEGINS RIFLING THROUGH THE CLOSET UNTIL SHE FINDS ANDREW'S TOOLBOX. RIGHT ON TOP IS A RUSTY KEYHOLE SAW. I PLANNED THAT I WOULD JUST CUT UP THE BODY, AND THEN HE'LL JUST BE GONE, AND HIS FAMILY WILL THINK THAT HE JUST TOOK OFF SOMEWHERE. LORI SLOWLY AND METHODICALLY STARTS CUTTING ANDREW TO PIECES. I JUST KIND OF BLOCKED OUT WHAT I WAS DOING. I FELT THE TURMOIL OF FEELINGS, BUT I KEPT THEM DOWN HERE, AND I THOUGHT, "I JUST NEED TO GET THIS DONE. ONCE I GET THIS DONE, IT WILL JUST DISAPPEAR." SHE ENTERS SOMETHING OF A FUGUE STATE, ALMOST PLAYING THE ROLE OF SOMEONE IN A BOOK OR A MOVIE. SHE SEES HERSELF CUTTING UP THE BODY, BUT IS IT REALLY HER? SHE SEES IT ALMOST AS SOMETHING SHE JUST HAS TO DO. IT'S A NECESSARY THING. TWO DAYS AFTER BLUDGEONING ANDREW TO DEATH, LORI HAS ONLY MANAGED TO REMOVE ONE OF HIS ARMS AND HIS RIGHT LEG. I'VE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK SOMEBODY HOW LONG IT TOOK TO CUT SOMEBODY'S FOOT OFF WITH A KEYHOLE SAW, AND SHE JUST MATTER-OF-FACTLY SAID, "OH, IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES." SHE'S PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DRAINED. HOW ARE YOU DOING? THEN, ACCORDING TO LORI, SHE RUNS IN TO HER NEIGHBOR FRANK. HE INVITES HER IN. WHAT'S BUGGING YOU? HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG. HE KEPT ASKING ME, AND AT FIRST, I SAID, "NOTHING, NOTHING." HE SAID, "SOMETHING'S REALLY WRONG," AND I SAID, "WELL, I'VE DONE SOMETHING." HE GOES, "WHAT DID YOU DO? WRITE A HOT CHECK OR SOMETHING?" I SAID, "NO." I'VE DONE SOMETHING REALLY BAD. PRISON-TIME BAD. HE SAID, "YOU KILLED ANDREW, DIDN'T YOU?" LORI. OH, MY GOD. FRANK TELLS LORI TO CALL THE POLICE. SHE REFUSES AND GOES HOME. HER FIRST MISTAKE, OF COURSE, WAS TO TELL HER FRIEND. THIS IS, TO ME, THE BIGGEST INDICATOR THAT SHE WAS IN A FUGUE STATE. AFTER SHE TOLD HER FRIEND, IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO HER THAT HER FRIEND MIGHT TELL THE POLICE. OVER THE NEXT FOUR DAYS, LORI GOES TO WORK EACH MORNING, THEN COMES HOME AT NIGHT TO CONTINUE CUTTING UP ANDREW'S BODY. I WRAPPED THEM UP, PUT THEM IN PLASTIC SHOPPING BAGS, AND THREW THEM IN DUMPSTERS. HOW LONG DID YOU THINK YOU COULD DO THIS? DID YOU HAVE A VISION OF THE END GAME? AT THIS POINT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GONNA DO. I JUST KNEW THAT I COULDN'T THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE. AT WORK, NO ONE HAD REALLY SUSPECTED ANYTHING WAS WRONG WITH YOU. NO, THEY VOTED ME EMPLOYEE OF THE WEEK. TOOK MY PICTURE, EVERYTHING. IN THE MEANTIME, LORI ALSO GOES LOOKING FOR ANDREW. HAVE YOU SEEN ANDY? WHILE SHE WAS DISMEMBERING HIM, SHE WENT OUT THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO PEOPLE, ASKING IF THEY HAD SEEN HIM. THE CHARADE GOES ON UNTIL FRIDAY, MAY 27, 1988. LORI IS ASLEEP IN HER APARTMENT WHEN SHE'S AWAKENED BY A LOUD POUNDING ON HER DOOR. LORI McLUCKIE, THIS IS THE POLICE. OPEN UP! ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS THAT IT WAS ANDREW'S FAMILY COMING TO KILL ME. AND THE DOOR CRASHED OPEN, AND I SAW UNIFORMS. AND I WAS RELIEVED. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WOULDN'T KILL ME. AND I REMEMBER I HEARD A MAN IN THE LIVING ROOM, SAYING, "**** JOHN, COME LOOK AT THIS ****" THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID. AND I REMEMBER FEELING SO ASHAMED. SHE HAD COMPLETELY CUT OFF HIS ARMS AT THE ARMPITS. SHE HAD COMPLETELY CUT OFF HIS LEGS AT THE HIPS. LORI IS LED OUT OF THE APARTMENT IN HANDCUFFS. HER NEIGHBOR FRANK HAS TURNED HER IN. FOUR MONTHS LATER, WHILE AWAITING TRIAL, LORI GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY BOY. HE'S PUT UP FOR ADOPTION. I SAW HIM IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A FEW MINUTES. I WAS HANDCUFFED WHEN I HELD HIM IN THE HOSPITAL. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS PUSHED TOO FAR, OR WAS SHE A LIONESS PROTECTING HER CUB? I TRULY DON'T KNOW. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE LORI KNOWS. IN JANUARY 1989, THE CASE GOES TO TRIAL. THE STATE ARGUES THE MURDER WAS PREMEDITATED. THIS WAS A WELL-PLANNED-OUT THING. SHE WENT TO EXTREME EFFORTS TO TRY TO COVER HER TRACKS. LORI CLAIMS SHE ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE. ONCE YOU'VE HANDCUFFED SOMEBODY TO A RADIATOR AND THEY'RE NO LONGER ANY TYPE OF DANGER TO YOU, IF YOU THEN KILL THEM, THAT IS NOT SELF-DEFENSE. WHAT IT WAS IS TORTURE. LORI IS CONVICTED OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER AND ABUSE OF A CORPSE. SHE'S SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON WITH A MINIMUM OF 40 YEARS BEHIND BARS. SHE WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE IN 2028. SHE'S GOT ICE WATER FLOWING THROUGH HER VEINS. I THINK SHE'S A SOCIOPATH. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR HER. I THINK SHE'S RIGHT WHERE SHE SHOULD BE. I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE LORI TO BE THE BIG MONSTER SHE'S PORTRAYED TO BE, BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE WERE TWO VICTIMS THAT DAY. I BELIEVE IT WAS LORI McLUCKIE AND ANDREW. NO, I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF. I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO FEEL SORRY FOR ME, EITHER. I DO HAVE HOPES AND DREAMS THAT MAYBE I CAN SOMEDAY DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH MY LIFE, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO BLAME BUT MYSELF. LORI IS A VERY FASCINATING FIGURE. YOU SEE HER FOR WHO SHE IS - SOMEONE WHO CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT HAPPENED HERSELF. SHE FEELS LIKE SHE DESERVES WHAT SHE GOT, AND YET YOU CAN NEVER BE 100% CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULDN'T POSE A DANGER TO OTHERS IF THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES PUSHED HER TO THE WALL AGAIN.
