 READING A BOOK, CROCHETING, GOING TO SCHOOL. I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A NURSE. HEY, GRANDMA. HER PARENTS WERE JUST TEENAGERS WHEN SHE WAS BORN, AND COULDN'T RAISE HER THEMSELVES. MY FATHER WAS 15. MY MOTHER WAS 16. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] SO, MY GRANDMOTHER STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE. YOU HAVE BETTER THINGS TO THINK ABOUT. INSIDE HER GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE, IT'S SAFE AND WARM. A FAR CRY FROM THE COLD AND DANGEROUS STREETS RIGHT OUTSIDE THEIR FRONT DOOR. THIS IS THE HOOD. IT CAN BE TREACHEROUS. AND IT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS IF THEY DON'T KNOW YOU. YOU COULD GET SHOT JUST FOR COMING OUT HERE. Narrator: SHERRSE'S GRANDMOTHER IS VERY STRICT AND KEEPS A CLOSE EYE ON HER. I LISTENED TO MY GRANDMOTHER. MY GRANDMOTHER WAS MY ROCK, MY HEART. IN MY EYES, SHE DID NO WRONG AND EVERYTHING SHE SAID WAS RIGHT. AND THAT'S HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, SO THAT'S HOW I LEFT IT. AND SO, WHAT HAPPENED TODAY AT LUNCH? Narrator: EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO BOYS, SHERRSE FOLLOWS HER GRANDMOTHER'S ADVICE. SHERRSE, FORGET ABOUT YOUR HOMEWORK. LET'S GO DOWN TO THE PARK. MY BOYS GOT SOME DRINKS. SOUNDS FUN, BUT MY GRANDMA'S HERE. I'LL SEE YOU, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. Dr. Jordan: SHERRSE'S GRANDMOTHER IS WELL-INTENTIONED IN KEEPING HER UNDER TIGHT CONTROL, BUT THAT LEVEL OF ISOLATION AND BEING CUT OFF FROM NORMAL TEENAGE EXPERIENCE CAN HAVE A BACKLASH EFFECT, AND SHERRSE CAN BE IN DANGER OF FALLING FOR THE VERY FIRST GUY WHO SHOWS HER ATTENTION. HEY, GRANDMA. YOUR GRANDMOTHER DID NOT WANT YOU DATING. SHE DID NOT. YOU THINK I COULD GO TO THE PARK REAL QUICK? WITH BOYS LIKE THAT? SHERRSE, NO. NOW, GET ON UPSTAIRS AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK. MM. Narrator: THE INEXPERIENCED GIRL IS ABOUT TO PUT HER GRANDMOTHER'S BOUNDARIES TO THE TEST. ONE DAY, A HANDSOME, 23-YEAR-OLD NEIGHBOR STROLLS BY SHERRSE'S HOUSE ON HIS WAY TO WORK. MY NAME'S GREG. SHERRSE. NICE TO MEET YOU. GREG HAS A GOOD CONSTRUCTION JOB AND LIVES DOWN THE STREET WITH HIS MOM. SEE, RIGHT ON THE CORNER. WHEN HE STOPS AND SAYS HI TO SHERRSE, HER HEART SKIPS A BEAT. MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU SOMETIME. YEAH, MAYBE. Gaines: HE WAS A GOOD GUY. HIS INTENTIONS WASN'T NEGATIVE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. Narrator: GREG LEAVES SHERRSE FEELING GIDDY, AND SHE'S THRILLED WHEN HE STOPS BY THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON. HE'S SWEET AND FUNNY, NOTHING LIKE THE GUYS AT HER SCHOOL THAT HER GRANDMOTHER'S BEEN WARNING HER ABOUT. HE'LL BRING A GIFT. HE WOULD SAY HI. SOON HE'S VISITING ALMOST EVERY DAY. I THINK MY GRANNY'S WATCHING US. HE WOULD COME TO TALK WITH ME, AND AS SOON AS MY GRANDMOTHER CAME, HE WOULD DISAPPEAR, LIKE, HE WOULD RUN THE BACK WAY. BUT SHERRSE'S GRANDMOTHER CATCHES ON, AND THE NEXT TIME GREG SWINGS BY ON HIS WAY HOME, SHE CORNERS HIM. YOUNG MAN... Gaines: MY GRANDMOTHER DIDN'T APPROVE OF IT AT FIRST. OF COURSE, SHE ASKED, "WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH SHERRSE?" BUT FORTUNATELY FOR SHERRSE, GREG KNOWS HOW TO TURN ON THE CHARM... I CAN SEE WHERE SHE GETS HER LOOKS FROM. OH, STOP IT. AND EASILY WINS HER GRANDMOTHER OVER. SHERRSE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. MY GRANDMOTHER LOVED HIM. SHE LOVED HIM. MY FAMILY LOVED HIM. IF YOUR YOUNG MAN'S STAYING FOR DINNER, TELL HIM TO WASH HIS HANDS. THANK YOU, GRANNY! [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: WITH THAT STAMP OF APPROVAL, SHERRSE'S ROMANCE WITH GREG QUICKLY BLOSSOMS. TWO YEARS LATER, SHERRSE GRADUATES FROM HIGH SCHOOL. BUT INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING HER GRANDMOTHER'S ADVICE TO GO TO COLLEGE, THE STRAIGHT-A STUDENT TAKES A JOB AS A CHECKOUT CLERK AT A GAS STATION... Gaines: [ LAUGHS ] Greg: YOU GOT IT? I GOT IT. I GOT IT. ...SO SHE AND GREG CAN GET THEIR OWN PLACE. FOR THIS LOVESICK YOUNG WOMAN, HER FUTURE IS ALL ABOUT BEING WITH THE MAN WHO SWEPT HER OFF HER FEET. Gaines: HE SAID HE LOVED ME. I SAID I LOVED HIM. AND WE WANTED TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL. NOW, WHAT WAS YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S ADVICE ABOUT LIVING WITH A MAN? SHE TOLD ME TO WAIT, GET A FEELING FOR BEING INDEPENDENT FIRST. DON'T DEPEND ON NO MAN, EVER. BUT THIS TIME, SHERRSE IGNORES HER GRANDMOTHER'S ADVICE. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I KNOW! DEEP DOWN, SHERRSE IS SURE GREG IS THE ONE. WERE YOU THINKING, "MAYBE THIS IS THE GUY I MARRY AND HAVE KIDS WITH?" YEP. [ CHUCKLES ] YES. MAYBE A LITTLE GIRL THAT LOOKS LIKE ME. MM. YEAH, YOU KNOW, I LOVED GREG THAT MUCH. SHERRSE IS HAPPIER THAN SHE EVER DREAMED SHE COULD BE. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] HELLO? THEN, ONE SPRING DAY IN 2003, HER WHOLE WORLD IS SHATTERED WHEN HER GRANDMOTHER SUDDENLY DIES. [ SOBS ] SHERRSE, ONLY 21 YEARS OLD, IS DEVASTATED. MY HEART CRUMBLED. SHE WAS MY WORLD. MY GRANDMA DIED. OH. Gaines: I TURNED INTO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON ONCE MY GRANDMOTHER DIED. Narrator: SHERRSE'S GRIEF OVER LOSING HER GRANDMOTHER IS CRIPPLING. I WAS GOING DOWNHILL. DOWNHILL. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THE STRESS. I FELT ALONE. I DIDN'T WANT NOBODY AROUND ME, NOT EVEN GREG. JUST LEAVE ME, PLEASE. THAT WAS MY MOTHER. SHE WAS ALL I HAD. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. NOT EVEN HER PRINCE CHARMING CAN HEAL THE PAIN SHE'S FEELING. I WAS ANGRY ALL THE TIME. YOU KNOW, I WOULD TAKE OUT A LOT OF THINGS ON HIM THAT WASN'T HIS FAULT. COME HERE! ALL RIGHT. YOU STAY HERE. I'LL GET IT. OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, SHERRSE SLOWLY EMERGES FROM HER CLOUD OF DEPRESSION, BUT BY NOW, GREG'S BECOME MORE DISTANT AND SHE'S ABOUT TO DISCOVER WHY. I'M GONNA GO WATCH THE GAME IN OTHER ROOM, ALL RIGHT? BUT WAIT. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO EAT TOGETHER. Greg: EH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. Gaines: GREG HAD SECRETS. HE HAD SECRETS. BUT YOU KNEW THEM. MM-HMM I ENDED UP FINDING OUT. WHO'S CINDY? [ SIGHS ] I MET SOMEBODY NEW. I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FIND OUT LIKE THIS. LOOK, JUST - FORGET IT. I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FIND OUT LIKE THIS. JUST FORGET IT. JUST FORGET IT. SO, WHAT HAPPENED? HE MOVED OUT. THIS IS YOUR DECISION OR HIS DECISION? I KICKED HIM OUT. THAT'S IT? YEAH. LOOK, SHERRSE, WE DON'T HAVE TO - GREG, JUST GET OUT! THAT WAS, PRETTY MUCH, THE END OF IT. SHE, YOU KNOW, SHE COULDN'T ACCEPT THAT HE HAD CHEATED ON HER. Dr. Jordan: WHEN SHERRSE FINDS OUT THAT GREG IS CHEATING ON HER, IT BURSTS HER BUBBLE. HER ENTIRE WORLD WILL IMPLODE BECAUSE SHE WAS LOOKING TO HIM FOR ALL OF HER EMOTIONAL NEEDS, AND IF HE HAS BETRAYED HER, WHAT ELSE DOES SHE HAVE? Narrator: THE PAINFUL BREAKUP COMING ON THE HEELS OF HER GRANDMOTHER'S DEATH IS TOO MUCH FOR SHERRSE TO HANDLE. SHE SPENDS THE NEXT FEW WEEKS INCONSOLABLE. OTHER THAN WORK, SHE HARDLY LEAVES THE HOUSE. WAS HE THE GREAT LOVE OF YOUR LIFE? HE WAS. MM. HE WAS. AFTER SIX MISERABLE MONTHS, A FRIEND OFFERS HER A NEW AND BETTER-PAYING JOB AS A SCHOOL-BUS DRIVER. DON'T WANT TO GET BEHIND SCHEDULE. SHE SOON FINDS THAT WORKING WITH KIDS IS A HELPFUL DISTRACTION. I LIKED MY JOB. IT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I WAS DOING WORKING AT THE GAS STATION. HOW'S IT GOING? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MONTHS, SHERRSE STARTS TO FEEL LIKE SHE'S MOVED ON FROM HER PAINFUL PAST. YOU GET BACK ON YOUR FEET? YEP. I WAS DOING REALLY GOOD. I WAS BACK TO MY OLD SELF. BUT HER WORLD IS ABOUT TO COME CRASHING DOWN AGAIN. [ TIRES SCREECH ] [ GLASS SHATTERS ] [ SCREAMING ] Narrator: AFTER MONTHS OF DEBILITATING HEARTACHE, A NEW JOB AS A SCHOOL-BUS DRIVER IS HELPING SHERRSE GAINES FINALLY GET OVER HER EX-BOYFRIEND, GREG. I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FIND OUT LIKE THIS. BUT A TERRIFYING INCIDENT THREATENS TO SEND HER ALREADY FRAGILE WORLD CRUMBLING TO THE GROUND. ONE MORNING, SHERRSE IS DRIVING THE SCHOOL BUS ON HER NORMAL ROUTE... [ CHILDREN LAUGHING ] [ HORN BLARES, TIRES SCREECH ] [ GLASS SHATTERS ] [ SCREAMING ] ...WHEN ANOTHER CAR COMES OUT OF NOWHERE, PLOWING HEADFIRST INTO THE BUS. CALL 911! Boy: WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER? SHERRSE? Gaines: WHEN THE IMPACT HAPPENED, I WENT OVER THE BARRIER AND IT WAS, LIKE, AN ONGOING CRASH. IT WAS HORRIBLE. [ SIREN WAILS ] KIDS WERE ON THE BUS. WHEN THAT HAPPENED, I WAS JUST LIKE, NO MORE. FORTUNATELY, NONE OF THE KIDS ARE HURT, BUT SHERRSE IS NOT SO LUCKY. SHE WAKES UP RATTLED WITH INJURIES TO HER NECK. WHAT'S GOING ON? ALL RIGHT. WE'RE JUST GONNA PUT A MASK ON YOU, OKAY? NO! ARE THE KIDS OKAY? YEAH. THEY'RE ALL RIGHT. [ SIREN WAILS ] I WAS OUT OF WORK FOR ABOUT A GOOD, MAYBE, TWO YEARS. MAYBE. ALMOST TWO YEARS. DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS, THIS, THERAPY, THAT. JUST, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO GET BACK. Dr. Jordan: WHAT KIND OF FEELINGS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STAGE OF YOUR LIFE? OH, I WAS OUT OF MY MIND THEN, BUT I DEALT WITH IT. WHERE DO YOU FIND THE STRENGTH? I DON'T KNOW. MY GRANDMOTHER. I GUESS SHE'S BEHIND ME, WITH HER HAND ON MY SHOULDER, SAYING, "YOU CAN DO IT, BABY. YOU CAN DO IT." Dr. Jordan: SHERRSE'S GRANDMOTHER WAS AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON HER LIFE. THOSE WORDS OF WISDOM ABOUT HER FUTURE AND HER CHOICES. EVEN AFTER HER GRANDMOTHER DIED, SHERRSE WOULD OFTEN ASK HERSELF, "WHAT WOULD GRANDMOTHER TELL ME TO DO RIGHT THIS MOMENT?" AND THIS WOULD GIVE HER STRENGTH. Narrator: SHERRSE SURVIVES ON THE MONEY SHE GETS FROM THE SETTLEMENT FOR THE BUS ACCIDENT. WHEN HER LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY IS OVER, SHE DECIDES TO FOLLOW THE PATH HER GRANDMOTHER WANTED FOR HER. SHE ENROLLS IN NURSING SCHOOL AND GETS A JOB AT A TEEN-CRISIS CENTER. DOESN'T EVEN LISTEN TO ME ANYMORE. Gaines: IT WAS HELPING TEENAGERS. TEACHING THEM THINGS THAT THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T TEACH THEM. SO, WHAT MY GRANDMOTHER TAUGHT ME, I WAS TEACHING THESE KIDS. THANKS. ANYTIME. DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT. [ LAUGHTER ] ON WEEKENDS, SHERRSE AND HER BEST FRIEND, BRANDI, START HANGING OUT AT A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR... I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY THAT. ...WHERE SHE INDULGES IN THE ALL THE THINGS HER GRANDMOTHER NEVER LET HER DO - DRINKING AND FLIRTING WITH ANY MAN WHO CATCHES HER EYE. HER AND BRANDI USED TO HANG TOGETHER, JUST THEM TWO. THEY'D COME IN THE BAR TO SEE ME. WE'D ALL SIT UP AND LAUGH AND TALK AND DRINK. THAT'S WHY YOU OUR GIRL, BARB. SHE NEVER CAME IN WITH NO GUYS. Narrator: EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS SINCE SHE AND GREG BROKE UP, THE HOLE IN HER HEART HASN'T FULLY HEALED. Dr. Jordan: WERE YOU STILL BROKENHEARTED? I WAS. I WAS HOPING THAT ME AND GREG WOULD GET BACK TOGETHER, BUT WE DIDN'T. HE ENDED UP GETTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE AND HAVING A BABY, TWO. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] ONE SATURDAY, THERE'S A HANDSOME, NEW FACE AT THE BAR, STEVE MITCHELL. RUMOR HAS IT, STEVE HAS JUST BEEN RELEASED FROM JAIL. I MEAN, A LOT OF GIRLS LIKED STEVE. A LOT OF 'EM. HE WAS A REAL NICE-LOOKING GUY, REAL NICE-LOOKING GUY. Narrator: WHEN STEVE SPOTS SHERRSE SITTING AT THE BAR, HE SETS HIS SIGHTS ON HER. HOW ARE YOU DOING? BUT AN EX-CON IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF GUY HER GRANDMOTHER WARNED HER ABOUT. YOU KNOW, I WEAVED MY WAY THROUGH... HE TRIED TO TALK TO ME. I TURNED HIM DOWN, LIKE, "BEAT IT!" YOU KNOW? I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME. MY NAME IS STEVE. SHERRSE. SHERRSE. MM. NICE TO MEET YOU. WHAT A LOVELY NAME. THANK YOU. YES. YES. Gaines: AFTER GREG, IT WAS LIKE, I DIDN'T GIVE NO MEN NO TIME OF DAY BUT STEVE'S NOT USED TO HAVING WOMEN SAY NO TO HIM. I'M GONNA LEAVE. MM. YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE AND ENJOY YOUR DRINK. I WILL. I'LL BE OVER THERE IF YOU NEED ME. YOU DO THAT. OKAY? OKAY. OKAY. JUST RIGHT OVER THERE. ALL RIGHT. BYE, SHERRSE. STEVE'S DETERMINED, AND THE NEXT WEEK, HE FINDS HER AT THE SAME BAR AND STEPS UP HIS GAME. BRANDI, HOW'S IT GOING? WHEN HE STARTED BUYING HER DRINKS, I KNEW... Mitchell: YOU WANT ANOTHER DRINK, RIGHT? Brown: HE HAD TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER TO GET HER, SO IT MADE IT MORE FUN. YOU JUST PICK UP YOUR HAND, YOU DO THAT, AND THEN YOU JUST WRITE. Brown: AND HE REALLY LIKED HER. Narrator: HIS EFFORT TO LURE SHERRSE IN FINALLY PAYS OFF. I WAS JUST LIKE, "OKAY. LET ME GIVE YOU MY NUMBER." WAS HE GROWING ON YOU AT THIS POINT? HE WAS, 'CAUSE HE WAS FUNNY. HE KIND OF REELED ME IN A LITTLE BIT WHEN HE REMINDED ME OF GREG. LUNCH. Mitchell: LUNCH. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. USE IT, DON'T ABUSE IT. I WILL [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: THE CONFIDENT LADIES' MAN SEES HIS WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY AND SEIZES IT. ONCE THEY START DATING, STEVE MAKES IT HIS MISSION TO WIN HER OVER COMPLETELY. OR HE WOULD HAVE A GIFT. OOH! I LOVE GIFTS. I GET THAT. A NICE, LITTLE SPARKLY BRACELET. I'M LIKE, "OH, OKAY. KEEP THE GIFTS COMING." SHERRSE LIKES THE ATTENTION. SHE IGNORES HER GRANDMOTHER'S VOICE IN HER HEAD AND SLOWLY LETS HER GUARD DOWN. THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME OUT TONIGHT. OF COURSE. HE WAS SLOWLY, BUT SURELY, FILLING THAT VOID. YOU KNOW, HE - LIKE I SAID, HE MADE ME LAUGH. HE ALWAYS TOLD ME HOW BEAUTIFUL I WAS. I GAVE HIM A CHANCE. Williams: ALL RIGHT, GIRL. YOU READY? Gaines: YES, I'M READY. BUT SHERRSE'S BEST FRIEND, BRANDI, ISN'T A FAN. I HEARD SOME STUFF ABOUT STEVE. IN FACT, SHE CLAIMS SHE'S LEARNED SOMETHING THAT PAINTS STEVE IN A WHOLE DIFFERENT LIGHT. Williams: HE HAD A REPUTATION FOR BEING A CHEATER, A LIAR, A LITTLE BIT ABUSIVE. I KNEW A PERSON WHO HE WAS SUPPOSED TO MARRY, AND THE REASON WHY SHE CALLED IT OFF WAS BECAUSE HE HAD PUNCHED HER IN HER FACE. SHE JUST SAID, "LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU." DON'T WORRY, BRANDI. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I'M JUST SAYING. Narrator: WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS, STEVE MOVES IN WITH SHERRSE. YOU'LL SEE. JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND. WAS IT JUST NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE TO GO HOME TO AT THE END OF A LONG SHIFT? IT WAS. IT WAS JUST... I LOVED HIM. I DID. CLOSE YOUR EYES. Gaines: I FELL FOR HIM. HE FELL FOR ME, TOO. I LOVE IT. I OPENED UP AND I LET HIM IN. STEVE'S NOT SHY ABOUT SPENDING MONEY, AND HE SPOILS HIS GIRLFRIEND AT EVERY TURN. HERE YOU GO. WHAT'S THIS FOR? IT'S SOMETHING TO HELP OUT WITH THE RENT, A COUPLE MONTHS' WORTH. YEAH, I WAS HAPPY THAT I HAD THE MONEY IN MY HAND, AND... HE WAS SPOILING YOU WITH MONEY. HE WAS. I LOVE IT. OH. Narrator: SHERRSE DOESN'T ASK WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM. Gaines: HE ALWAYS SAID, "I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB. "I WAS WORKING, BUT IT'S HARD FINDING A JOB WITH MY BACKGROUND." SHERRSE IS CLEARLY IN DENIAL ABOUT THE SOURCE OF STEVE'S INCOME. SHE ENJOYS HAVING THE RENT PAID AND RECEIVING SHOWERS OF GIFTS, SO SHE SIMPLY DOESN'T ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. Narrator: SHERRSE SEEMS TO HAVE TAMED THE HANDSOME PLAYBOY... LADIES. HEY, HONEY. HE WAS SUCH A GOOD GUY TO SHERRSE IN THE BEGINNING, THAT I KIND OF HAD TO SECOND-GUESS MYSELF AND THINK THAT MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A HATER. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: BUT IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE STEVE SHOWS HIS TRUE COLORS IN DRAMATIC FASHION. A FEW MONTHS AFTER HE MOVES IN, SHERRSE AND STEVE ARE GETTING COZY AT THE BAR WHEN, ACCORDING TO SHERRSE AND BRANDI, A WOMAN COMES UP, JOLTING SHERRSE BACK INTO REALITY. Gaines: STEVE, WHO IS THIS? REALLY? WHO AM I? I'M PREGNANT WITH HIS CHILD, THAT'S WHO I AM. YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT WITH NOTHING. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW? STEVE, WHAT THE HELL IS SHE TALKING ABOUT? Narrator: STEVE IS DENYING EVERYTHING, BUT SHERRSE DOESN'T BELIEVE A WORD. TWO MONTHS AGO! I WAS WITH YOU. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. LIKE, HOW WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME? YOU'RE LIVING IN MY HOUSE, YOU'RE SMOOCHING UP TO ME EVERYDAY LIKE NOTHING'S GOING ON, BUT HERE YOU ARE. SHERRSE AND BRANDI CLAIM THE OTHER WOMAN WON'T LEAVE UNTIL SHE GETS SOME ANSWERS. DON'T TOUCH ME! IT WAS LIKE, "I'M DONE WITH YOU." ARE YOU SAYING TO ME THAT RIGHT THERE IN THE BAR YOU TOLD HIM THAT'S IT? I'M DONE. HELL YEAH! I WAS UPSET. AND I WAS SMOKIN'! SHERRSE, LET'S GO. LET'S GO. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? I TRIED TO TAKE THIS PRIVATELY, BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GET UP AND BE A MAN... Narrator: STEVE REALIZES HE'S JUST BEEN DUMPED. THAT'S NOT MY CHILD. THE SITUATION WAS ESCALATING. YOU WANT TO SIT THERE AND CALL ME A LIAR? SHE WAS RUNNING OFF AT HER MOUTH. HE WAS RUNNING OFF WITH HIS MOUTH, AND HE HAD BEEN DRINKING. SHE WAS PISSING HIM OFF EVEN MORE, AND AS THAT LIQUOR SET IN, HONEY, HE TURNED INTO DIABLO. AT THE TIME, I REALLY SEEN CRAZY COME INTO HIS EYES. Woman: I HAVE YOUR FREAKING CHILD... GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? Narrator: SHERRSE GAINES CLAIMS SHE'S JUST DISCOVERED THE MAN SHE LOVES MAY HAVE CHEATED ON HER. I'M PREGNANT AND YOU'RE THE FATHER. ACCORDING TO SHERRSE, WHEN SHE BREAKS UP WITH HIM, THE SMOOTH-TALKING PLAYBOY SUDDENLY LOSES HIS COOL. Brown: STOP IT! GET OUT OF HERE! HE HAD HIT HER SO HARD THAT HE HAD LIFTED HER UP OFF OF HER FEET, AND SHE WENT FLYING. SHE FELL IN BETWEEN THE BARSTOOLS, AND THE BARSTOOLS FELL ON TOP OF HER. YOU ALWAYS STARTING DAMN TROUBLE. Narrator: STEVE IS IMMEDIATELY TOSSED OUT OF THE BAR... IT'S NOT COOL. ...LEAVING SHERRSE IN A STATE OF SHOCK. THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE HAD EVER SEEN ANY TYPE OF VIOLENCE, PHYSICAL ALTERCATION FROM HIM. IT CAUGHT HER OFF GUARD. Narrator: STEVE CALLS THE NEXT DAY TO APOLOGIZE. HE WAS JUST - HE'S SORRY, YOU KNOW, IT JUST HAPPENED. Mitchell: Listen, listen. It's not what you think. All right? ARE YOU SERIOUS? DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID? Narrator: BUT SHERRSE DOESN'T TRUST HIM. SHE'S AFRAID IF SHE STAYS WITH STEVE SHE COULD BECOME HIS NEXT TARGET. NO, YOU CAN GET ALL OF YOUR STUFF. IT'S ALL SITTING OUT HERE IN THE DRIVEWAY. No, babe. NO, I'M DONE. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK TO YOU. SHERRSE TRIES TO GET OVER STEVE BY FOCUSING ON SCHOOL AND WORK, BUT IN SPITE OF THE RED FLAGS, DEEP DOWN SHE WANTS HIM BACK. Williams: DID YOU WORK OUT? Narrator: THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND, SHE AND BRANDI ARE BACK AT THE BAR WHERE SHERRSE KNOWS SHE'LL PROBABLY RUN INTO STEVE. SO, YOU'RE BACK TO YOUR STRONG SELF, PRE-STEVE, BUT THEN YOU GO TO THE BAR WITH BRANDI, AND WHO'S THERE? STEVE'S THERE. HE WAS AT THE END OF THE BAR. HE WAS PEEKING, WATCHING, LOOKING. YOU KNOW, I MADE IT MY BUSINESS TO TALK TO SOMEBODY ELSE, SHOW HIM THAT YOU ARE A NON-FACTOR AT THIS POINT. HE ENDING UP SENDING NOTES FROM DOWN THERE, YOU KNOW. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR JUDGEMENT, SHERRSE? I DON'T KNOW. I WAS BLINDED. BLINDED BY LOVE? I WAS. I THOUGHT IT WAS LOVE. Williams: I EXPECTED THEM TO GET BACK TOGETHER BECAUSE SHE WAS SO IN LOVE AT THE TIME, THAT - YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY HARD, ONCE YOU LOVE SOMEONE, TO LET IT GO. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY? Narrator: LIKE AN ADDICT NEEDING A FIX, SHERRSE CAN'T RESIST STEVE'S POWER OVER HER. STEVE MAY HAVE SWEET-TALKED SHERRSE INTO TAKING HIM BACK, BUT SHERRSE'S EYES ARE NOW OPEN. SHE STILL WANTS THAT RELATIONSHIP, BUT NOW, SHE'S GOING TO LOOK AT STEVE IN A WHOLE NEW WAY. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, HE MOVES BACK INTO HER APARTMENT, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BECOMES STEAMIER THAN EVER. EVEN THOUGH THINGS SEEM FINE IN THE MOMENT, DEEP DOWN, SHERRSE HAS DOUBTS ABOUT STEVE'S LOYALTY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AND IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE THOSE FEARS ARE REALIZED. [ PHONE CHIRPS ] EXCUSE ME. SIX MONTHS AFTER STEVE'S EXPLOSION AT THE BAR, SHERRSE IS AT HER NEW JOB AS A MEDICAL ASSISTANT, WHEN SHE GETS SOME DISTURBING NEWS. NO, HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE RIGHT NOW. Dr. Jordan: YOU WERE AT WORK, AND YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE WARNING YOU, "STEVE'S IN YOUR HOME. THERE'S A LOT OF TRAFFIC GOING ON." THERE'S A LOT OF TRAFFIC. WHICH MEANS? HE COULD EITHER BE SELLING DRUGS OR HE'S CHEATING. SHERRSE DECIDES TO TRY TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT. I WAS USUALLY WORKING 4:00 TILL 8:00 IN THE MORNING. I'M GOING, OKAY? OKAY. CAME HOME EARLY - 12:00. AND I CAUGHT HIM IN MY BED WITH A FEMALE. I REALLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT WENT DOWN. EVERYTHING WENT RED. SHERRSE LOSES IT. THIS TIME, SHE STRIKES BACK. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I WENT UP BEHIND HIM AND I PUNCHED HIM SO HARD, WITH ALL OF MY MIGHT. HE DIDN'T SEE IT COMING. DON'T YOU KNOW I WILL BEAT YOUR ASS?! AS THE OTHER WOMAN RUSHES OUT OF THE HOUSE, SHERRSE TAKES AIM AT HER TWO-TIMING BOYFRIEND. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Gaines: MY ATTENTION REALLY WASN'T ON HER. GET OUT! GO! IT WAS HIM THAT I WAS UPSET WITH. LIKE, YOU WENT THIS FAR. HURRY! GO! LIKE, IF YOU'RE GONNA CHEAT, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THEIR YEAR-LONG RELATIONSHIP, SHERRSE BOOTS STEVE OUT OF THE HOUSE. [ KNOCKING ] BUT STEVE CAN'T LET GO, AND ONCE AGAIN, THIS CONFIDENT AND COCKY WOMANIZER REFUSES TO GIVE UP. LET ME JUST COME INSIDE. LET'S TALK. JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT. BUT SHERRSE IS SICK OF PUTTING UP WITH HIS CONSTANT BETRAYAL, SO SHE DECIDES TO LET STEVE BACK IN, BUT ON HER TERMS. HE CAN SPEND THE NIGHT, BUT ONLY WHEN INVITED. AT THAT POINT AND MOMENT, HE WAS A BOY-TOY. NOT SO IN LOVE ANYMORE? NOPE. BUT YOU'RE ENJOYING THE BENEFITS? I AM. HE WAS THE ONLY GUY THAT I'D BEEN WITH FOR A WHILE, A LONG TIME, IT WAS GOOD. Dr. Jordan: SHERRSE IS WILLING TO STAY WITH STEVE, BUT THE TERMS HAVE CHANGED. NOW SHE CALLS THE SHOTS. THE RELATIONSHIP WILL BE SEXUAL AND PHYSICAL, BUT NOT EMOTIONAL. STEVE WAS WILLING TO DO THIS, BUT WILL HE BE ABLE TO HANDLE THESE NEW CONDITIONS? Narrator: SHERRSE WILL START BY GIVING HIM A TASTE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE. OUT IN PUBLIC, SHE OPENLY FLIRTS WITH OTHER GUYS RIGHT IN FRONT OF STEVE. IT SEEMS THE TABLES HAVE TURNED AND SHERRSE IS MILKING IT FOR ALL IT'S WORTH. BY THEN, SHE WAS SHOWING HER TRUE SIDE. SHE WAS BEING WITH OTHER DIFFERENT GUYS UP THERE. [ LAUGHS ] SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW? JUST GOING AROUND SLEEPING WITH OTHER GUYS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? SO, I'M, LIKE, REALLY PUSHING HIM AWAY. BLOWING HIM OFF. I'M, AT THIS POINT, I'M SO DONE. YOU DO NOT EVEN EXIST TO ME ANYMORE, WHAT YOU PUT ME THROUGH. Narrator: HER BEHAVIOR STOKES STEVE'S JEALOUSY. STEVE HAS STARTED BECOMING VERY CONTROLLING. I'M SICK OF IT! JUST STOP TALKING. HE DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE HER WITH ANYBODY ELSE. YOU COULD TELL HE WAS LOSING HIS MIND. STEP OFF. LET'S GO. BYE, STEVE. LET'S GO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT DO I MEAN? I DON'T WANT YOU AT THE BAR WITH NO OTHER DUDES, YOU UNDERSTAND ME? Narrator: OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS, SHERRSE AND STEVE'S NEW, CASUAL RELATIONSHIP BECOMES A POWDER KEG OF RESENTMENT. THE MORE SHERRSE FLIRTS, THE ANGRIER STEVE BECOMES, ESPECIALLY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME! IT WAS, MORE OR LESS, LIKE, MAYBE HIM PUSHING ME AGAINST THE WALL. GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! OR, "BITCH, DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD." OR HIM GRABBING ME, OR, YOU KNOW, BUT I WOULD ALWAYS FIDGET MY WAY OUT OF IT OR GET IN MY CAR AND LEAVE OR CALL BRANDI. "HE'S CRAZY." IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A DIFFERENT SIDE OF STEVE. I THINK HE LOST IT WHEN HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO MORE ME FALLING FOR HIS CRAP. BUT SHERRSE CONSIDERS THE ABUSE A SMALL PRICE TO PAY... HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? ...FOR HAVING ABSOLUTE POWER OVER HER MAN. Brown: THEN, FINALLY, HE STARTED FOLLOWING HER AROUND LIKE A LITTLE PUPPY, AND I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE TROUBLE THEN. Dr. Jordan: SHERRSE MIGHT BE USING HER NEWFOUND POWER TO MAKE STEVE JEALOUS, BUT IN TRUTH, STEVE IS NOT GOING TO BE SO MUCH JEALOUS AS RESENTFUL. IT'S MOST LIKELY THAT STEVE WILL BECOME EVEN MORE ABUSIVE. [ CELLPHONE CHIRPS ] HELLO, STEVE. Hey, baby. Where you at? Narrator: ON THE NIGHT OF MARCH 24th, 2009, SHERRSE GETS A PHONE CALL FROM STEVE ASKING FOR A RIDE. WE WERE OUT PARTYING, HAVING A GREAT TIME, LAUGHING, JOKING. HE PRETTY MUCH JUST GAVE HER AN ADDRESS AND SAID "COME GET ME. I'M AT THIS BAR." Narrator: SHERRSE AGREES TO COME GET HIM... HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING? BUT WHEN SHE GETS TO THE ADDRESS, SHE'S SHOCKED TO DISCOVER IT'S A STRIP CLUB. INSTEAD OF STOPPING, SHERRSE SPEEDS OFF, LEAVING STEVE OUTSIDE IN THE COLD. HEY, WHAT - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! HEY, HEY, HEY! I WAS UPSET. I WAS PISSED OFF, TO BE EXACT. HE'S NOT TREATING YOU WELL. HE'S NOT GOING TO EVER TREAT ME WELL. AND FROM THAT POINT ON, IT WAS LIKE I NEED TO MOVE ON. WAS THAT AN EYE-OPENER FOR YOU? IT WAS. Narrator: SHERRSE HEARS HER GRANDMOTHER'S VOICE AGAIN, AND REMEMBERS HOW SHE WAS RAISED. IT WAS LIKE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I DESERVE BETTER. I CAN DO BETTER. I AM BETTER. HE HAD YOU COME PICK HIM UP FROM THE STRIP CLUB? BACK AT HOME, SHERRSE CALLS BRANDI AND THE TWO LAUGH PICTURING STEVE WAITING OUTSIDE IN THE COLD. BUT MINUTES LATER, SHE HEARS BANGING AT THE FRONT DOOR. Mitchell: SHERRSE! [ KNOCKING ] SHERRSE! AND IT'S HIM SCREAMING, HOLLERING, DRUNK, STUMBLING. Mitchell: I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE. Gaines: AND, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, I'M AT THE POINT WHERE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I'M NOT TAKING ANYMORE. Mitchell: OPEN THE DOOR. AFTER MONTHS OF BOTTLING UP HER EMOTIONS, SHERRSE FINALLY LET'S STEVE HAVE IT. AND ONCE THE FLOOD GATES ARE OPEN, SHE CAN'T STOP. Gaines: I STAND UP FOR MYSELF, AND I LAY IT ALL OUT ON THE LINE, EVERYTHING. HIM CHEATING, EVERYTHING. AND HE REALIZES THAT I'M NOT PLAYING THIS TIME. I SAID, "YOU GOT TO GET OUT. YOU HAVE TO GO. DON'T COME BACK." I'M NOT GOING! AND THIS TIME, SHE VOWS NEVER TO TAKE HIM BACK. NO, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. NO, YOU ARE NOT HERE. YOU CAN GO... Gaines: WE ARGUED, YOU KNOW, VERBALLY FIGHTING. THE NEXT YOU KNOW, HE JUST GRABS ME. IT'S OVER! NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH ME! BUT WAS THERE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS TIME? GET OFF ME! IT WAS MORE FORCE BEHIND IT. STOP! GET OFF! Stop! BRANDI, WHO IS STILL ON THE PHONE, CAN TELL THE FIGHT IS ESCALATING. SHERRSE! HE WAS IRATE. I COULD HEAR THROUGH THE PHONE HIM CURSING AND SCREAMING. GET OFF OF ME! NO! MY FIRST INSTINCT - SAVE MYSELF, GET HIM OFF ME. STOP! I HEARD HER SCREAMING FOR HIM TO KEEP HIS M-EFFING HANDS OFF OF HER. AND, YOU KNOW, AT THAT POINT IN TIME, I DECIDED I'M CALLING THE POLICE. [ COUGHING ] Gaines: HE'S JUST GOT HIS HANDS AROUND MY NECK, AND HE'S SQUEEZING, AND I CAN'T GET HIM OFF. Woman: Emergency, what is the problem? MY FRIEND SHERRSE GAINES IS BEING BEAT UP BY HER BOYFRIEND, STEVEN MITCHELL. I CAN'T BREATHE. MY VISION IS GETTING BLURRED. EVERYTHING'S GOING DARK. I PANIC. THE ONLY THING I COULD THINK OF WAS GRAB SOMETHING, ANYTHING, JUST TO HELP ME. AND I FOUND SOME SCISSORS. Mitchell: AAH! Narrator: SHERRSE AND STEVE'S ON-AGAIN-OFF-AGAIN RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN ON A COLLISION COURSE FOR MONTHS... GET OUT! WHEN SHERRSE FINALLY DECIDES TO END IT FOR GOOD, STEVE SNAPS. SHERRSE GRABS THE CLOSEST THING SHE CAN TO GET HIM OFF OF HER, A PAIR OF SCISSORS... [ GROANS ] AAH! DAMN, YOU CRAZY BITCH! SHERRSE KICKS INTO SURVIVAL MODE. HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU SWING AT HIM? MAYBE ABOUT FIVE OR SIX. BUT HE LET GO OF YOUR NECK? HE LET GO. [ SOBBING ] WHEN HE GOT OFF OF ME IT WAS LIKE [GASPS]. YOU KNOW, I WAS TRYING TO CATCH MYSELF. MY BODY WAS SO HEAVY. I COULDN'T REALLY STAND FOR REAL. YOU KNOW, IT WAS LIKE HE TOOK ALL THE LIFE OUT OF ME. IT WAS SCARY. I THOUGHT I WAS DYING. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Officer: HELLO? POLICE! IT WAS LIKE A RELIEF. MY BOYFRIEND, HE TRIED TO CHOKE ME... AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE THERE TO HELP ME. AAH! OFFICERS TAKE ONE LOOK AT STEVE AND CALL FOR AN AMBULANCE. I WAS COVERED IN BLOOD. I WAS JUST LAYING IN BED... THIS CRAZY BITCH - SHE JUST CAME IN... HE'S LYING! HE JUST CAME OVER... MA'AM! MA'AM! I NEED YOU TO SIT DOWN! SIT DOWN! Gaines: YOU KNOW, I TOLD 'EM, I SAID, "HE ALMOST CHOKED THE LIFE OUT OF ME." BASED ON WHAT THEY SEE, POLICE BELIEVE STEVE'S STORY... MA'AM, I NEED YOU TO STAND UP, PLEASE. ...AND ARREST SHERRSE. TURN AROUND. HE STARTED BANGING ON THE... I NEED YOU TO TURN AROUND. WHAT? Gaines: I SAID, "WELL, CAN I TALK?" THEY SAID, "NO. YOU SHUT UP." THIS IS NOT EVEN HIS HOUSE. ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHILE STEVE TAKES A RIDE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, SHERRSE IS BOOKED AT THE PITTSBURGH COUNTY JAIL. McCune: SHERRSE WAS CHARGED WITH AGGRAVATED ASSAULT CAUSING BODILY INJURY WITH A DEADLY WEAPON, AND THAT CARRIES A POTENTIAL MAXIMUM PENALTY OF 10 YEARS INCARCERATION. HEY, SHERRSE, THIS IS BRANDI. I'M CALLING YOU AGAIN... Narrator: BRANDI HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH SHERRSE SINCE CALLING 911. [ SIGHS ] WHEN SHE TURNS ON THE TV... WHAT? LO AND BEHOLD, MY FRIEND'S FACE IS PLASTERED ACROSS THE NEWS. AND I'M LIKE, "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?" WHAT ARE THEY ARRESTING HER FOR? I WAS VERY SHOCKED BECAUSE I WAS THE PERSON WHO CALLED THE POLICE. I LET THEM KNOW THAT HE WAS ATTACKING HER. Narrator: STEVE'S FRIENDS AT THE BAR ARE ALSO IN SHOCK. EVERYBODY FELT BAD FOR STEVE. LET ME SAY IT THAT WAY. EVERYBODY LIKED STEVE. HE WAS NICE TO EVERYBODY. HE HAD A BIG HEART. FOR THE NEXT SIX AGONIZING DAYS, SHERRSE SITS IN HER CELL WONDERING IF STEVE WILL SURVIVE. THE WHOLE TIME I WAS IN JAIL HE WAS STILL IN CRITICAL CARE, AND I JUST WAY PRAYING THAT HE WOULD BE OKAY, THAT HE'D PULL THROUGH. ONE WEEK AFTER THE FIGHT, SHERRSE HEARS THAT STEVE HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL. THE NEXT DAY, THEY'RE BOTH CALLED INTO COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY HEARING. SHERRSE'S STOMACH IS IN KNOTS. SHE'S SCARED OF FACING STEVE, AND TERRIFIED THAT HE'LL ACCUSE HER OF TRYING TO KILL HIM. BUT STEVE HAS HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. HE DIDN'T LOOK AT ME LIKE, "YOU BITCH," LIKE, YOU KNOW? IT WAS LIKE, "I'M SORRY." HE TOLD THEM THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES. HE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. McCune: NOW, IN MY OPINION, THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY AN INNOCENT AND INJURED PARTY, AND HE HAS HIS OWN LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT WERE STEMMING OUT OF THIS INCIDENT. YOUR HONOR, IT'S THE STATE'S POSITION TO PROCEED WITH THE PROSECUTION IN THIS MATTER. Narrator: BUT THE STATE DECIDES TO TAKE UP THE CASE ANYWAY, AND A TRIAL DATE IS SET FOR THE FOLLOWING APRIL. IN THE MEANTIME, SHERRSE IS RELEASED FROM JAIL WITHOUT BAIL. SHE TRIES TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED, AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT HER LIFE BACK TOGETHER. WHILE I WAS IN JAIL, I LOST MY JOB, I GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL 'CAUSE I MISSED SO MANY DAYS THAT I COULDN'T STOP CRYING. YOU GOT THE TIME ON YOU? TO NUMB THE PAIN, SHE TURNS TO HER FAVORITE PASTIME, HITTING THE BARS WITH BRANDI. ME AND BRANDI WERE BACK TO BEING BRANDI AND SHERRSE. AND WE'D GO TO HAVE COCKTAILS. HI. MY NAME'S TIM, NICE TO MEET YOU. I'M SHERRSE. Narrator: THIS TIME, SHERRSE DECIDES NOT TO TEMPT FATE AND PICKS A BAR ACROSS TOWN. SHERRSE IS FLIRTING UP A STORM WHEN BRANDI GETS HER ATTENTION. Gaines: WHAT'S WRONG? GUESS WHO'S HERE? SHE SEES STEVE. DON'T PLAY WITH ME, BRANDI. LITTLE DOES SHE KNOW, HE'S BEEN HUNTING HER DOWN SINCE SHE WAS RELEASED FROM JAIL A MONTH AGO. HAD YOU SEEN HIM SINCE COURT? I DIDN'T. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? HE DOESN'T EVEN NORMALLY HANG OUT IN THAT BAR, SO HIM COMING TO THAT BAR WAS LIKE HE'S COMING LOOKING FOR ME. HE WAS STALKING ME. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIS BROKEN HEART. HE CHASED HER, TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER, BUT IT JUST MADE IT WORSE. HE WENT ON A WARPATH. I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA LOSE HIS MIND. Narrator: IT'S OBVIOUS THAT STEVE STILL CARRIES A TORCH FOR SHERRSE, BUT SHE'S NOT HAVING IT. SHERRSE, WHAT'S GOING ON? HE STARTED CALLING ME A SLUT, AND HE'S WORRIED ABOUT ME... YOU'RE STALKING ME NOW? ...HE LOVES ME. I'M LIKE, "STEVE, YOU DON'T LOVE ME. "LEAVE ME ALONE. IF YOU LOVE ME, YOU'LL LEAVE ME ALONE." STEVE GOES BEFORE THE COURT AND INSISTS THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES. WHEN HE SEE SHERRSE IN THE BAR, HE PERCEIVES SHE'S UNGRATEFUL FOR WHAT HE DID FOR HER, AND IT MAKES HIM COMPLETELY CRAZY. HEY! HEY! SO, HE KIND OF DIDN'T GRASP THE CONCEPT THAT SHE NO LONGER WANTED TO BE WITH HIM. DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD DO THIS ANOTHER TIME? I'LL DO IT WHERE I WANT TO DO IT, ALL RIGHT? HE STILL WANTED TO BE WITH SHERRSE. HE WAS VERY MUCH IN SOME TYPE OF TWISTED LOVE AFFAIR IN HIS OWN MIND. LOOK, YOU NEED TO CHILL. I THINK YOU NEED TO CHILL. YOU NEED TO GET UP OUT OF HERE. Narrator: BRANDI CAN'T KEEP STEVE'S TEMPER UNDER CONTROL. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? THIS IS MY PROBLEM... BRANDI, SHE'S LIKE, "HOLD UP," YOU KNOW? SHE WENT AND GOT SECURITY. ALL RIGHT. LISTEN TO ME. YOU NEED TO GO. Gaines: THEY CAME AND TOLD HIM HE HAD TO GO. Narrator: AN HOUR LATER, SHERRSE LEAVES THE BAR TO GRAB A JACKET FROM HER CAR... AND GETS AN UNWELCOME SURPRISE. [ DOOR CLOSES ] HEY! STEVE IS BACK... DRIVE! ...AND HE'S IN A BLIND RAGE. HE HOPS IN MY CAR, SO I'M STARTLED. I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD." HE'S LIKE, "DRIVE, BITCH." I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA MAKE ME DRIVE INTO AN ALLEYWAY SOMEWHERE. I THOUGHT HE ALREADY HAD IT ALL PLANNED OUT, AND HE WAS GOING TO KILL ME. I WAS SCARED. HE JUST STARTED GOING OFF, CALLING ME ALL TYPES OF NAMES AND TELLS ME HE HATES ME. THEN I REACHED DOWN, GRABBED IT... Narrator: AFTER STABBING HER BOYFRIEND, STEVE, DURING A FIGHT, SHERRSE GAINES IS NOW TRYING TO MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE. BUT STEVE WANTS HER BACK AT ANY COST. DRIVE! HEY! FORTUNATELY, SHERRSE IS WELL-ARMED WITH MACE. [ MACE CAN HISSING ] AAH! [ IMITATES SPRAY CAN ] I EMPTIED A WHOLE CAN, AND I DIDN'T STOP. AAH! AAH! SPRAYING THE MACE, HITTING HIM. SHERRSE TELLS BRANDI WHAT HAPPENED WHILE STEVE, BLINDED BY THE MACE, STUMBLES OUT OF THE CAR. GIRL, I JUST HAD TO MACE STEVE. WHAT? YES. SHE KNOWS WHAT STEVE'S CAPABLE OF... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK OUT THERE. AND ASKS BAR SECURITY FOR HELP. Man: YOU STAY HERE. THEY CASE THE BLOCK, BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF STEVE ANYWHERE. LATER THAT NIGHT, WHEN IT'S TIME TO HEAD HOME, BRANDI LEAVES THE BAR FIRST TO MAKE SURE THE COAST IS CLEAR. AS SHE GETS READY TO DRIVE AWAY, HER STOMACH DROPS. ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW. ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW! CALL SHERRSE... Williams: I ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOW AND PRETENDED LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. HE SAID, "CALL SHERRSE OUT HERE, OR I'M GONNA KILL YOU." CALL SHERRSE. STEVE, WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY YOU GOT A GUN? DON'T WORRY ABOUT... YOU KICK INTO SELF-PRESERVATION MODE, AND YOU START THINKING OF THINGS THAT YOU NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD THINK OF, AND YOU BECOME VERY CRAFTY. AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT HAPPENED. I'M GONNA CALL HER. IT'S COOL. HURRY UP. HURRY UP! Narrator: BRANDI MAKES THE CALL, BUT NOT TO SHERRSE. HELLO? I DIALED 911. Woman: EMERGENCY, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? HEY, SHERRSE... I SAID, "SHERRSE GAINES, IF YOU DO NOT GET OUT HERE, STEVEN IS GOING TO KILL ME." AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY. IF YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME, THEY'RE GOING TO KNOW EXACTLY WHO DID IT." AT FIRST, THE 911 OPERATOR DID NOT CATCH ON. Woman: What is your location? THEN, FINALLY, SHE REALIZED THAT I WAS GIVING HER A DESCRIPTION OF WHO WAS ATTACKING ME... OKAY! AND I NEEDED HELP IMMEDIATELY. HE'S GONNA KILL ME. THAT - SAY IT AGAIN. I'M GONNA KILL YOU. Narrator: STEVE HAS NO IDEA WHO BRANDI IS TALKING TO, BUT HIS PATIENCE HAS WORN THIN. HURRY UP! YES. SHE'S COMING. HE TURNS TOWARDS SHERRSE'S CAR AND TAKES AIM. [ GUNSHOTS ] YOU HEAR ALL TYPES OF GUNSHOTS, MAYBE ABOUT 12 GUNSHOTS, MAYBE. GOOD THING I DIDN'T LEAVE, 'CAUSE HE - I BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE KILLED ME. Williams: THE 911 OPERATOR ASKED ME, SHE SAID, "ARE YOU OKAY?" I SAID, "I'M FINE." AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE TAKES OFF. [ SIRENS WAILING ] HE WAS RIGHT HERE... RIGHT HERE? ...SHOOTING UP THE CAR. Narrator: POLICE ARRIVE MINUTES LATER, BUT BY THEN STEVE IS LONG GONE. HE TOLD ME TO CALL HER, OTHERWISE HE WAS GONNA KILL ME. A WARRANT IS ISSUED FOR HIS ARREST. WHILE POLICE SEARCH FOR STEVE, SHERRSE DECIDES TO MOVE OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SHE'S CONVINCED IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE STEVE COMES LOOKING FOR HER. ONE MONTH LATER, POLICE CATCH STEVE. Williams: IT WAS DEFINITELY A RELIEF, YOU KNOW? BECAUSE, AT THAT POINT IN TIME, I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS GOING TO BE, WHERE HE WAS GONNA POP UP. Narrator: IN APRIL 2010, SHERRSE RETURNS TO COURT TO FACE CHARGES FOR STABBING STEVE. BUT WHEN THE COURT LEARNS OF HIS PENDING ASSAULT CASE, THEY DROP ALL CHARGES. Judge: DROPPING ALL CHARGES. CASE DISMISSED. I COULDN'T SEE A JURY, OR EVEN A JUDGE, SEEING THIS AS SOMETHING OTHER THAN SELF-DEFENSE. IT'S THE BEST RESOLUTION. STEVE ISN'T SO LUCKY. EIGHT MONTHS LATER, IN DECEMBER 2010, HE PLEADS GUILTY TO SHOOTING UP SHERRSE'S CAR. THE STATE SENTENCES STEVE MITCHELL TO EIGHT YEARS IN THE PENITENTIARY. [ GAVEL BANGS ] HE IS SENT TO STATE PRISON FOR THE NEXT FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS. DO YOU WORRY ABOUT A FEW YEARS FROM NOW, WHEN HE GETS OUT? I DID. I MOVED. I MOVED TO THE SUBURBS FAR AWAY, AND NOBODY KNOWS WHERE I LIVE AT. BUT STEVE'S FRIENDS SAY THE ONLY THING STEVE'S REALLY GUILTY OF IS BEING IN LOVE. Brown: IF HE WAS A MEAN-SPIRITED PERSON, HE'D HAVE PUT HER IN JAIL WHEN SHE GUTTED HIM LIKE HE WAS A FISH, BUT HE DIDN'T, AND HE STILL TRIED TO GET WITH HER. THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW MUCH HE CARED. SO THEY CAN'T MAKE STEVE INTO A VILLAIN. HE'S JUST A MAN WITH A BROKEN HEART. Dr. Jordan: THE END OF THE STORY WITH STEVE REALLY BROUGHT SHERRSE FULL CIRCLE AND BROUGHT HOME ALL OF THE LESSONS HER GRANDMOTHER HAD ALWAYS TRIED TO IMPART. THAT SHE IS HER OWN WOMAN, SHE DOES NOT NEED ANY MAN OR ANY RELATIONSHIP TO DEFINE HER. Narrator: SHERRSE HAS GOTTEN HER LIFE BACK ON TRACK. SHE HAS A GOOD JOB AS A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT, AND IS FOCUSED ON HER FUTURE. IT'S A LIFE HER GRANDMOTHER WOULD HAVE WANTED FOR HER. DO YOU HAVE A MAN IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW? NO. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ONE, EITHER. I'M NOT. IS SHERRSE IN CHARGE OF SHERRSE? YES, SHE IS. AND I'M JUST LIVING MY LIFE. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
