 SHE'S VERY DEVOTED TO HER KIDS. Narrator: TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, DONNA SEEMS LIKE A WOMAN WHO'S GOT HER ACT TOGETHER. CHECK ON MR. HAWKINS IN ROOM 4. HE HAD A ROUGH NIGHT. I HAVE KNOWN DONNA SINCE WE WAS ABOUT 8 YEARS OLD. DONNA'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL PERSON. SHE IS ONE IN A MILLION. SEE Y'ALL TOMORROW. Narrator: BUT DEEP DOWN, DONNA IS VULNERABLE. HER DAD BAILED ON THE FAMILY EARLY ON, AND HER MOM GOT SUCKED INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF ADDICTION. AT AN EARLY AGE FOR DONNA, I TOOK A WRONG TURN IN LIFE. I BECAME A DRUG ABUSER. Narrator: AND WHEN IT COMES TO MEN, IT'S BEEN ONE LONG STRING OF HEARTACHES. YASMIN - THAT'S MY FIRST CHILD. HER FATHER WAS KIND OF, LIKE, MY FIRST LOVE. WE WERE TOGETHER FOR MOST OF MY TEENAGE YEARS, AND I HAD YASMIN AT THE AGE OF 18. WE GREW UP AND GREW APART. Narrator: BOYFRIEND NUMBER TWO, EDDIE, ISN'T MUCH OF AN IMPROVEMENT. WE HAD A BABY - A SON, JOSHUA, MY SECOND CHILD. JOSHUA'S FATHER HIT ME ONCE, AND I CALLED THE POLICE AND I HAD HIM ARRESTED. HE FLED THE COUNTRY, WENT BACK TO SANTO DOMINGO. Narrator: ENTER MAN NUMBER THREE, ROGER. HE SEEMS LIKE A STRAIGHT-UP GUY WITH A SOLID MILITARY CAREER. Donna: I FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS MARRIED, AND SO THAT KIND OF DESTROYED THE RELATIONSHIP. AND ALSO I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS PREGNANT. Narrator: DONNA GIVES ROGER A DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE BUT KEEPS THE BABY. AT THIS POINT, SHE'S RAISING TWO GIRLS AND A BOY. THEN, A FEW MONTHS AFTER BREAKING UP WITH ROGER, DONNA UNEXPECTEDLY RECONNECTS WITH EDDIE. HOPING FOR SOME SEMBLANCE OF A FAMILY, SHE GIVES HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. BUT ONCE AGAIN, EDDIE CAN'T LIVE UP TO DONNA'S STANDARDS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP EXPIRES QUICKLY... THOUGH NOT BEFORE SHE'S PREGNANT YET AGAIN WITH HER FOURTH CHILD, JONATHAN. DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. DONNA JUST GOT IT IN HER HEAD THAT SHE NEEDED A MAN TO COMPLETE HER. SHE NEVER REALLY HAD A MOMENT IN HER ADULT LIFE WHERE SHE WAS JUST SINGLE, HOLDING STILL, LOVING LIFE. IT WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE NEXT BOYFRIEND. Narrator: AT 26, DONNA'S BATTING ZERO WITH MEN, AND SHE'LL HAVE TO RAISE HER FOUR YOUNG KIDS ON HER OWN. Donna: I JUST DECIDED AT THAT TIME THAT I WAS JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON MY KIDS. Narrator: STILL, SHE DREAMS THAT ONE DAY, SHE'LL FIND A FATHER FOR HER FAMILY. TWO YEARS LATER, DONNA'S ON HER WAY TO SEE A GIRLFRIEND WHEN A YOUNG MAN CATCHES HER EYE. AND THEN AN ANGEL WALKS UP ON ME. YOU THINK I'M GONNA JUST LET YOU WALK PAST ME? Donna: HE WALKED OVER TO ME, AND HE SAID, "HI, CUTIE." [ LAUGHS ] AND HE WAS SO FUNNY. I JUST KEPT WALKING. HE FOLLOWED ME. HE FOLLOWED ME FOR, LIKE, FOUR BLOCKS. HE HAD A PERSONALITY THAT JUST MADE ME SO BUBBLY INSIDE. I JUST COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING. Narrator: KEVIN IS CHARMING, DIFFERENT FROM ANY MAN SHE'S EVER KNOWN. SO YOU AND HIM HAVING DINNER OR SOMETHING? Donna: HE WAS DETERMINED TO GET TO KNOW WHO I WAS. AND HE WAS CUTE. HE WAS REALLY HANDSOME AND WELL-DRESSED AND FUNNY. OKAY. WELL, HOW ABOUT... Narrator: KEVIN JACKSON TRAILS DONNA FOR BLOCKS. WHEN SHE TURNS HIM DOWN FOR A DATE, HE WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. BYE. FINALLY, SHE GIVES IN. BYE.BYE. YOU CRAZY, KEVIN. [ LAUGHS ] Donna: I HAVE NEVER MET A GUY LIKE THAT. HE HAD A WAY WITH WORDS TO GET YOU TO SMILE [Chuckling] AND SAY YES TO ANYTHING. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] Narrator: DONNA'S INSTANTLY HOOKED AND THINKS THIS TIME, SHE JUST MIGHT HAVE FOUND MR. RIGHT. SO, HOW WOULD AN OUTSIDER DESCRIBE THE TWO OF YOU, DONNA AND KEVIN, AS A COUPLE? PROBABLY INSEPARABLE... BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER. WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER THAT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, WE WERE TOGETHER EVERY DAY. KEVIN SEEMS LIKE THE MODEL BOYFRIEND DONNA'S BEEN SEARCHING FOR. EVERY DAY, HE BRINGS HER LUNCH AT THE HOSPITAL AND PICKS HER UP AFTER WORK. ALL RIGHT. WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS, DONNA IS FALLING DEEPLY IN LOVE. WE CONFIDED IN EACH OTHER A LOT. WE REALLY GOT CLOSE. WE BECAME FRIENDS. BEST OF FRIENDS. YOU HAD A DEEP EMOTIONAL BOND WITH KEVIN, DIDN'T YOU? YES, I DID. THIS WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME ON A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL. THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP I HAD WITH KEVIN IS WHAT I WANTED ALL ALONG. WHEN KEVIN STARTS SHOWING INTEREST IN DONNA'S KIDS, IT SEALS THE DEAL. HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM, AND I LOVED HIM ALONE FOR JUST THAT MATTER, BECAUSE IF I WAS GONNA BE WITH ANYBODY, THEY HAD TO LOVE MY CHILDREN. Donna: HOW'S MY BABIES? A YEAR LATER, KEVIN MOVES IN. WHILE DONNA'S AT WORK DURING THE DAY, KEVIN STAYS HOME AND TAKES CARE OF THE KIDS. AND YOU TRUSTED HIM? YES, I DID. I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY HOUSE, MY CHILDREN. I FELT THAT HE WOULD PROTECT THEM. NOW, YOU WERE WORKING ALL THE TIME, MAKING THE MONEY, PAYING THE RENT. BUT KEVIN'S NOT WORKING MUCH. EXPLAIN THAT. I NEVER CONCERNED MYSELF WITH IT IN THE BEGINNING, BECAUSE HE WAS JUST ALWAYS DOING EVERYTHING ELSE. SO IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME THAT HE WASN'T WORKING. DONNA DOESN'T REALIZE THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE MEN JUST BASICALLY USES HER FOR HER STABILITY, HER SECURITY, AND SHE ENABLES THEM TO BE LAZY SLACKERS. SO, YOU HAVE TO ASK, IS EVERY ONE OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS GOING TO END BADLY? Narrator: STILL, FOR NOW, DONNA'S TRUST IN KEVIN SEEMS VALID. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A SINGLE PARENT. I WANTED MY CHILDREN TO HAVE A MOTHER AND A FATHER, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE MY MOTHER AND FATHER CONSISTENTLY IN MY LIFE. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: BUT THE TRUTH IS, KEVIN ISN'T EXACTLY MR. MOM. WHEN MY MOM WAS AT WORK, HE WOULD BE HOME TAKING CARE OF US. HOWEVER, HE WOULD BE ASLEEP MOST OF THE TIME. SO IT WOULD BE MY OLDER SISTER YASMIN WHO WOULD HAVE TO COOK, CLEAN. SO SHE WAS LIKE OUR SECOND MOM WHEN MY MOM WOULD BE AT WORK. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] HELLO? Narrator: WHEN DONNA FINALLY SPOTS THE FIRST RED FLAGS, SHE'S COMPLETELY CAUGHT OFF GUARD. YOU CRAZY. WHO YOU ON THE PHONE WITH? Donna: AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF OUR RELATIONSHIP, THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE. DON'T - GET OFF THE DAMN PHONE. FOR INSTANCE, THE KIDS WEREN'T ALLOWED TO ANSWER THE DOORS IF SOMEONE CAME. EVERY TIME THAT PHONE RANG, HE WANTED TO KNOW WHO WAS ON THE OTHER LINE. SHUT UP. I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT MAYBE IT'S SOME THINGS THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE TO PLEASE HIM. SO I WENT ALONG WITH IT, EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE IT. KEVIN. BABY, I'M SORRY. [ Ringing ] Narrator: DONNA'S MOTHER ALSO STARTS TO SEE REASON FOR CONCERN. KEVIN? WHO'S THIS? YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS. HE WOULD NEVER, EVER LOOK YOU EYE TO EYE WHEN HE SPOKE TO YOU OR WHEN HE TALKED TO YOU. AND I KNEW HE WAS JEALOUS AND MISTRUSTING. HE WASN'T MY CUP OF TEA. AND I DIDN'T REALLY WANT HIM FOR MY DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW? I WANTED THE BEST FOR HER. OH, HI, MAMA. OH, OH, WAIT. I'M SO SORRY. Narrator: SOON, KEVIN STARTS OBSESSIVELY CHECKING UP ON DONNA WHEN SHE'S AT WORK. [ Sweetly ] HEY, KEVIN. WHERE YOU BEEN AT?! BABY, I'VE BEEN BUSY WITH MY PATIENTS. Donna: IT BECAME OVERBEARING THAT I HAD TO EXPLAIN WHERE I'M GOING ALL THE TIME. WELL, I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE AT WORK. I CALLED YOU ABOUT AN HOUR AGO! THERE ARE ALWAYS WARNING SIGNS FOR THESE WOMEN WHO TEND TO ENABLE THE MEN IN THEIR LIVES. AND YET THEY RATIONALIZE THEM AWAY. "BUT I ALREADY HAVE SO MUCH INVESTED. IT'S ME WHO NEEDS TO CHANGE, NOT HIM." Narrator: DONNA'S FANTASY FAMILY IS ABOUT TO SHATTER. WELL, I KNEW SOMETHING WAS REALLY WRONG WITH HIM WHEN I WENT TO THE STORE ONE DAY WHILE HE WAS ASLEEP. Narrator: COMING UP, KEVIN COMPLETES HIS TRANSFORMATION FROM DREAM MAN TO DEVIL. WHAT? YOU ACT LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW. [ CLATTER ] Narrator: DONNA BROWN HAS SPENT MUCH OF HER LIFE CHASING AFTER MEN, HOPING TO FIND ONE WHO'S MARRIAGE MATERIAL. UNFORTUNATELY, HER LATEST LOVE IS BEGINNING TO SHOW HIS DARK SIDE. LENNY? AS DONNA WALKS HOME FROM THE MARKET, SHE RUNS INTO LENNY WASHINGTON, ONE OF HER BOYFRIEND KEVIN'S BUDDIES. TELL KEVIN TO GIVE ME A CALL. I WILL. I WILL. GOOD SEEING YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO. THANK YOU. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. BABY, YOU HUNGRY? YEAH. LATER THAT EVENING, DONNA CASUALLY TELLS KEVIN ABOUT BUMPING INTO HIS FRIEND. HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU HI. ALL RIGHT, I MADE US SOME CHEESEBURGERS, BABY. WHAT? YOU ACT LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW. [ CLATTER ] AAH! Donna: KEVIN WALKED OVER TO ME AND SLAPPED ME. I WAS JUST SO SURPRISED AND HURT THAT HE HIT ME, AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. AND HE IMMEDIATELY RAN OVER TO WHERE I WAS AND GRABBED ME AND HUGGED ME. AND THEN HE TOLD ME OVER AND OVER, "I'M SO SORRY. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I HIT YOU." AND HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT THIS PARTICULAR FRIEND OF HIS HAD CARRIED ON WITH HIS GIRLFRIENDS BEHIND HIS BACK IN THE PAST. AND SO I FELT SORRY FOR HIM, BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS FRIEND. Narrator: DONNA ACCEPTS KEVIN'S APOLOGY AND CONVINCES HERSELF IT WAS A ONETIME EVENT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. AFTER ALL, KICKING KEVIN TO THE CURB WOULD MEAN THE END OF HER FAIRY TALE. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] THE SPELL KEVIN HAS ON DONNA IS SO STRONG, IT EVEN DRIVES HER MOTHER AWAY. WHY YOU COME IN HERE ARGUING ALL OF A SUDDEN? I'M NOT ARGUING. HE AND I GOT INTO IT, AND... ARE YOU TAKING CARE OF MY DAUGHTER? I'M TAKING CARE OF YOUR DAUGHTER. ...DONNA TOOK HIS SIDE. SHE SAID, "THIS IS MY MAN, SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO LEAVE." IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU NEED TO LEAVE. YOU'RE ASKING YOUR MAMA TO LEAVE? YES, MAMA. IT HURT AN AWFUL LOT. HE IS TRYING, MAMA. BUT SHE BACKED HIM UP KNOWING THE TYPE PERSON HE WAS, BUT SHE WAS COMMITTED TO HIM. I NEVER WENT BACK AROUND AFTER THAT. Narrator: PRETTY SOON, DONNA STARTS TO NOTICE THAT KEVIN'S ACTING PARANOID. YOU LOCKED THE DOOR? DON'T MOVE. KEVIN, BABY. COME TO BED. Donna: AND THAT'S WHEN I REALLY NOTICED THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG. I WAS BLAMING MYSELF. I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, "WHAT DID I DO WRONG?" NO. I KNOW I HEARD SOMETHING. I KNOW I... AND IT WASN'T ME. IT WAS HIM. BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS SEE IT. WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE, YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. Narrator: JUST A FEW WEEKS LATER, DONNA DISCOVERS SOMETHING THAT SHAKES HER FAITH IN KEVIN TO THE CORE. Donna: I'M IN THE HABIT OF WHEN I'M DOING MY LAUNDRY, I CHECK THE POCKETS OF EVERYTHING IN CASE THERE'S SOME MONEY. BUT THIS DAY, I FOUND MONEY, BUT IT WASN'T JUST MONEY, YOU KNOW? IT WAS MONEY WITH WHITE POWDER IN IT... ...WHICH I KNOW IS COCAINE. MY HEART JUST SUNK. NOW MY MIND IS RACING. HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DOING THIS? AND THE FACT THAT HE HAD IT IN MY HOUSE AROUND MY CHILDREN... Narrator: DONNA IS DEVASTATED. MEMORIES OF HER MOTHER'S DRUG PROBLEMS COME FLOODING BACK. Donna: I DESPISE DRUGS. I DECIDED A LONG TIME AGO THAT I WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A DRUG ADDICT. I WAS ALWAYS GONNA BE THERE FOR MY CHILDREN. Narrator: YET A PART OF DONNA IS ALSO RELIEVED. THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WHEN SHE FINDS DRUGS IN HIS POCKET, INSTEAD OF SAYING, "OH, MY GOD! KEVIN IS DOING DRUGS OR EVEN DEALING DRUGS," SHE'S RELIEVED. "NOW I HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR HIS VIOLENT "AND ERRATIC AND CONTROLLING BEHAVIOR. IT'S THE DRUGS! THIS MUST BE FIXABLE." Narrator: DONNA ISN'T ABOUT TO LET KEVIN'S DRUG USE HURT HER FAMILY. Donna: HE HAS TO STOP THIS. I HAVE BABIES IN HERE. I DIDN'T EVER WANT MY CHILDREN TO BE AROUND DRUGS EVER. Narrator: SO THAT EVENING, DONNA BRACES HERSELF AND CONFRONTS HIM. WE NEED TO TALK. ABOUT WHAT? KEVIN, I FOUND... SHE URGES KEVIN TO GO TO REHAB, CONFIDENT HE CAN CHANGE, JUST LIKE HER MOTHER DID. YOU'RE DOING DRUGS, KEVIN. SHE STOOD BY ME THROUGH MY DRUG ADDICTION. SHE DIDN'T APPROVE, BUT SHE DID EVERYTHING THAT SHE COULD TO HELP ME THROUGH IT. Donna: AND I SAID, "WELL, KEVIN, YOU HAVE TO STOP USING. "I'VE SEEN IT DESTROY SO MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT I LOVE, EVEN MY MOTHER." I GAVE HIM AN ULTIMATUM. THIS HAS TO STOP, AND IF YOU DON'T STOP... I SAID, "YOU EITHER STOP DOING DRUGS"... GET OUT OF MY FACE. "...OR YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE." NO, I'M NOT. [ GROANS ] AND HE KICKED ME IN MY MOUTH. Narrator: DONNA RUNS TO HER NEIGHBOR'S APARTMENT TO CALL THE POLICE. [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] SHE REPORTS WHAT KEVIN DID. ARE YOU SERIOUS, DONNA? BUT SHE LEAVES OUT A CRITICAL PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR THE SAKE OF PROTECTING HER MAN. LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO MY MOUTH! Donna: I DIDN'T TELL THEM ABOUT THE DRUGS. I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GET IN TROUBLE. THEY COULD SEE MY MOUTH WAS SWOLLEN NOW AND IT WAS BLEEDING. THEY ASKED ME DID I WANT TO PRESS CHARGES, AND I SAID, "NO. I JUST WANT HIM TO GET OUT." HERE'S HIS STUFF. ARE YOU SERIOUS? YES, I'M SERIOUS. REALLY, DONNA? Narrator: OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, KEVIN BEGS DONNA TO TAKE HIM BACK. BUT SHE REFUSES, DECIDING SHE'S DONE WITH HER VIOLENT BOYFRIEND. BYE. THAT IS, UNTIL SHE GETS SOME SHOCKING NEWS THAT COULD HANDCUFF HER TO KEVIN FOR GOOD. Narrator: IN 1997, DONNA BROWN'S A SINGLE MOM OF FOUR LIVING IN HARLEM, NEW YORK. AFTER HER BOYFRIEND KICKS HER IN THE FACE, SHE KICKS HIM OUT OF HER LIFE... UNTIL TWO WEEKS LATER, WHEN SHE GETS NEWS THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING. I LEARNED THAT I'M PREGNANT. KEVIN, I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. Narrator: DONNA'S STILL NOT SURE SHE WANTS TO TAKE KEVIN BACK. BUT SHE FEELS SHE'S AT LEAST GOT TO TELL HIM THE NEWS. WHAT'S WRONG? KEVIN, I'M PREGNANT. HOW DID KEVIN REACT TO THE NEWS OF YOUR PREGNANCY? KEVIN WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY. HE WAS SO PROUD. I'M GONNA BE A FATHER?! THAT'S GREAT! Donna: HE JUST TALKED ON AND ON ABOUT HOW GREAT OF A FATHER HE WAS GONNA BE, AND MY HEART JUST MELTED. I SAID, "AWW, HE'S SO HAPPY HE'S FINALLY GONNA HAVE A KID." I NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE, AND THIS BABY WILL HELP ME. Dr. Jordan: SHE THINKS SHE'S DONE WITH HIM. SHE WANTS HIM OUT. AND YET HOW CAN SHE KICK HIM OUT OF HER LIFE NOW? MAYBE SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. MAYBE HE WOULD MAKE A GREAT FATHER. ALL OF THESE THOUGHTS SWIRL AROUND IN HER HEAD. IT'S A PERFECT STORM THAT'S REALLY JUST A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. Narrator: FOR THE SAKE OF HER EXPANDING FAMILY, DONNA LETS GO OF THE PAST. SOME DAYS REMIND HER OF THE GOOD TIMES THEY SHARED WHEN THEY FIRST MET. Donna: HE WOULD DO THE NORMAL THINGS LIKE EAT DINNER WITH US AND WATCH A MOVIE. WE'D SIT AND TALK LIKE THE OLD TIMES. Narrator: BUT PRETTY SOON, THE GOOD TIMES FADE. KEVIN'S INCREASINGLY DISTURBING BEHAVIOR OVERSHADOWS EVERYTHING. HE'S NOT EATING. HE'S STILL PACING THE HOUSE. AND HE'S DOING WEIRD THINGS NOW. I WOULD GO TO SLEEP, AND I WAKE UP. HE'S STILL STANDING THERE. KEVIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? JUST STARING. AND SO HIS BEHAVIOR GOT REALLY WEIRD. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? HE WAS LIKE DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE. HE HAD THIS SPLIT PERSONALITY. Narrator: DONNA WONDERS IF SHE'S MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. KEVIN? [ SNIFFS ] ONCE YOU GET SO DEEP INTO DRUGS, YOU LOSE REALITY, YOU KNOW? HE WAS DEMANDING, HE WAS POSSESSIVE. HE WAS A VERY JEALOUS MAN. THAT WAS ONE SIDE OF HIM. THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE. THERE WAS A GENTLE SIDE TO HIM. YOU CAN'T EVEN PLAY ON THE DOGGONE VIDEO GAME. Narrator: BUT THAT GENTLE SIDE SHOWS ITSELF LESS AND LESS. WHEN HE'S HIGH, KEVIN LASHES OUT AT EVERYONE. GO TO YOUR ROOM! GET OUT OF HERE! WHEN HE'S ON THEM DRUGS, HE'S LIKE THIS, LIKE AN EVIL PERSON. AND HE TALKS AT YOU WITH ATTITUDE. AND WHEN HE'S ON DRUGS, YOU ONLY HAVE A MINUTE CONVERSATION WITH HIM, 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM HIM, TOO. [ SIGHS ] COME ON, DONNA. WHY ARE YOU WITH THIS GUY, FOR REAL? Narrator: THOUGH DONNA TRIES TO HIDE THE CRACKS, IT'S OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE THAT HER SO-CALLED HAPPY FAMILY IS A FAKE. I ONLY TOLERATED HIS NONSENSE BECAUSE DONNA IS MY BEST FRIEND AND SHE WANTED ME TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK WITH HIM. SHE REALLY LOVED HIM. I'M GONNA PLAY SOME VIDEO GAMES. Narrator: DONNA'S KIDS NEVER KNOW WHICH KEVIN THEY'RE GOING TO GET. Jonathan: THERE WOULD BE A TIME WHERE HE WAS THIS HORRIBLE MAN, CURSING US ALL OUT. GO TO YOUR ROOM! GET OUT OF HERE! BUT THEN WHEN WE WAKE UP, HE'S LIKE, "OH, GOOD MORNING." AND IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, BE LIKE, "WELL, WASN'T YOU JUST MAD AT US LAST NIGHT, "CURSING US OUT, AND YELLING AT US, CALLING US ALL TYPE OF NAMES?" IT WOULD BE CONFUSING TO ALL OF US IN THE HOUSE. WHY YOU STILL UP? Narrator: WHEN DONNA'S 8 MONTHS' PREGNANT WITH THEIR TWIN GIRLS, KEVIN'S OUTBURSTS ONLY GET WORSE. YOU KNOW, YOU GET ON MY NERVES SOMETIMES. ONE NIGHT, HER 6-YEAR-OLD SON, JONATHAN, IS READING IN THE LIVING ROOM. Jonathan: I NEVER KNEW WHEN HE WAS GONNA SNAP. IT JUST CAME SUDDENLY. SO, LIKE, I WOULD JUST TRY TO AVOID IT AND NOT GO ANYWHERE NEAR HIS DIRECTION. WHAT YOU CRYING FOR? YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A LITTLE SISSY. YOU'RE WORSE THAN YOUR LITTLE SISTER. Narrator: THIS TIME, DONNA OVERHEARS FROM THE NEXT ROOM. LOOK, YOU DON'T BE TALKING TO MY SON LIKE YOU'RE CRAZY! AND I TOLD HIM TO LEAVE JONATHAN ALONE, DO NOT TALK TO MY BABY LIKE THAT. AND I THINK THE FACT THAT I SAID "MY BABY" PUSHED HIM OVER THE EDGE. AT THAT MOMENT, I JUST LEFT ON MY OWN. I WENT IN MY ROOM AND SLAMMED MY DOOR. I MEAN, ALL I COULD DO IS CRY. WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS? I'M ONLY A CHILD. Narrator: JONATHAN IS TERRIFIED AS HE LISTENS TO THE HEATED ARGUMENT OUTSIDE HIS DOOR. I DON'T CARE HOW OLD HE IS! KEVIN - AAH! Jonathan: IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, ALL I COULD IMAGINE IS, "OH, MY GOD. I HOPE HE WOULD GET OFF MY MOM." Narrator: KEVIN SHOVES DONNA, AND SHE LANDS ON HER STOMACH. [ GROANS ] GETTING IN MY FACE AGAIN! WHAT I TOLD YOU?! I MANAGED TO GET MYSELF ON THE COUCH, AND I STAYED ON THE COUCH FOR I THINK ABOUT FIVE OR SIX HOURS BEFORE I EVEN GOT UP. I JUST LAID THERE, 'CAUSE I WAS IN THAT MUCH PAIN. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, DONNA FEELS GUILTY ABOUT WHAT HER KIDS HAD TO WITNESS. [ SIGHS ] MOMMY WANT TO TALK TO Y'ALL. Donna: I CAN SEE THAT MY CHILDREN WERE BECOMING AFRAID OF HIM, SO I'M TRYING TO LET THE CHILDREN KNOW THAT WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IS NOT HEALTHY, AND THAT I'M SORRY, TELLING THEM HOW MUCH I LOVE THEM. JONATHAN, IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, OKAY? I'M SO SORRY. WHEN YOU GROW UP, DON'T HIT YOUR GIRLFRIENDS. Narrator: DONNA FEELS TRAPPED BY FEAR AND SELF-DOUBT. SHE TELLS NO ONE ABOUT THE ABUSE. IF SHE HAD CONFIDED IN ME, MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT SITUATION. MAYBE I'D HAVE RATHER FOUGHT WITH HIM THAN HAVE HIM FIGHT WITH HER. YOU OKAY? Narrator: THE PATH DONNA'S WALKING IS TREACHEROUS, RECRUITING HER OWN KIDS TO KEEP HER SECRETS. YOU, TOO, BABY. MWAH. IT MAY GIVE HER STRENGTH TO GET THROUGH THE SITUATION, BUT IT GIVES KEVIN MORE STRENGTH TO KEEP PERPETUATING THE ABUSE. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] Narrator: SEVERAL DAYS LATER, DONNA STILL FEELS LINGERING PAIN FROM THE ATTACK. EVEN WORSE, SHE ONLY FEELS MOVEMENT ON ONE SIDE OF HER BELLY. KEVIN. I'M NOT FEELING ONE OF THE BABIES MOVE. AND SO I TOLD HIM THAT, "LISTEN, WE HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. I ONLY FEEL ONE CHILD MOVING." DAMN, YOU WANT ME TO FIX THIS OR WHAT? WE'LL GO AFTER I'M FINISHED. I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL. Narrator: KEVIN RELUCTANTLY AGREES. COME ON. HE WENT WITH ME TO SEE WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY. I THINK HE WAS SCARED MORE THAN ANYTHING - SCARED OF WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THE DOCTORS AND IF HE PROBABLY WOULD GET ARRESTED. Narrator: AT THE HOSPITAL, DONNA TELLS THEM SHE THINKS SOMETHING MAY BE WRONG WITH ONE OF HER BABIES. KEVIN STAYS RIGHT BY HER SIDE. WHEN THE DOCTOR ASKS WHAT HAPPENED, DONNA NEEDS TO THINK FAST. HER ANSWER WILL DECIDE KEVIN'S FATE. Doctor: DID ANYTHING HAPPEN? COMING UP, KEVIN'S ESCALATING DRUG HABIT PUTS DONNA'S KIDS DIRECTLY IN HARM'S WAY. I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED OF HIM. Narrator: DONNA BROWN IS 8 MONTHS' PREGNANT AND TERRIFIED. A FEW DAYS AGO, HER COCAINE-ADDICTED BOYFRIEND ATTACKED HER. [ GROANS ] SHE GOES TO THE E. R., FEARING FOR THE HEALTH OF HER UNBORN TWINS. DID ANYTHING HAPPEN? BUT INSTEAD OF TURNING KEVIN IN, SHE COVERS FOR HIM. I TOLD THE DOCTORS THAT I SLID DOWN SOME STAIRS. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, DONNA? IT'S NEW YORK CITY. IF YOU FIGHT TOO MANY TIMES, THEY'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR CHILDREN AWAY. THAT WAS MY MAIN CONCERN - NOT LOSING MY KIDS. ON TOP OF BEING IN LOVE WITH KEVIN, WANTING EVERYTHING TO WORK, I THINK I WAS JUST TRYING TO KEEP MY FAMILY TOGETHER AND MAKE IT SANE AS POSSIBLE. MA'AM... THE DOCTOR DECIDES TO INDUCE LABOR. DONNA GIVES BIRTH TO TWO HEALTHY TWIN GIRLS. SHE IS NOW A MOTHER OF SIX. I'M YOUR DADDY. I'M YOUR DADDY. WHEN SHE BRINGS THE BABIES HOME, DONNA IS SURPRISED BY HOW KEVIN HANDLES HIS NEW ROLE AS A FATHER. HE IS HAPPY AND HELPFUL. THOSE TWINS, THOSE NEWBORNS, WERE THE PERFECT EXCUSE FOR HER TO NOT DEAL WITH KEVIN, AND YET THEY WERE ALSO THE VERY THING THAT BOUND KEVIN TO HER. Narrator: BUT THE HAPPY PHASE IS SHORT-LIVED. KEVIN'S HAVING A HARD TIME BREAKING HIS ADDICTION. AND HE'S GETTING MORE AND MORE CARELESS. ONE AFTERNOON, DONNA'S SON JONATHAN COMES FACE-TO-FACE WITH KEVIN'S HABIT. I WOULD FIND LITTLE, LIKE, BAGS UNDER THE CABINET, YOU KNOW, AND LITTLE WHITE STUFF IN IT. AND SO I KNEW THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY DRUG USING. NOW I KNOW THIS IS WHY HE'S ACTING BERSERK. Narrator: JONATHAN KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KEVIN LOSES HIS TEMPER, SO HE KEEPS WHAT HE FOUND TO HIMSELF. Jonathan: I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED OF HIM. THE EASIEST WAY TO DEAL WITH IT WAS TO JUST GO ALONG WITH IT AND TO NOT MAKE MATTERS WORSE. Narrator: AS KEVIN GROWS EVEN MORE VIOLENT, DONNA SLIPS DEEPER INTO DENIAL. SHE SUFFERS IN SILENCE, TELLING NO ONE THAT KEVIN'S MADE HER HIS PERSONAL PUNCHING BAG. Donna: I MEAN, I'M GETTING HIT IN THE FACE. I'M GETTING BUSTED LIPS. I'M HAVING BRUISES THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW I HAVE MYSELF. IT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND THAT HE WAS PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE TO MY DAUGHTER... BECAUSE HAD I KNOWN, NO WAY WOULD I HAVE EVER ALLOWED HIM TO PUT HIS HAND ON MY CHILD. SO, NO MATTER HOW FAR IT GOES - PHYSICAL ABUSE, EMOTIONAL ABUSE, ANY OTHER WOMAN WOULD PROBABLY SAY, "DONNA, WALK AWAY. BE DONE WITH THIS." BUT SHE CAN'T GIVE UP ON KEVIN. NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE DREAM, BUT BECAUSE OF WHO SHE IS - THE ULTIMATE ENABLER. I LOVE YOU, TOO. Narrator: AMAZINGLY, IT'S NOT UNTIL THE TWINS ARE 3 YEARS OLD THAT KEVIN'S LIFESTYLE FINALLY TAKES HIM DOWN. HOW MUCH? $100. HE'S ARRESTED FOR DEALING AND GETS SENTENCED TO TWO TO FOUR YEARS IN PRISON. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. COULD DONNA'S NIGHTMARE FINALLY BE OVER? Donna: I CRIED, BUT INSIDE, I WAS HAPPY. I WAS HAPPY. I KNEW THAT HE NEEDED THE ARREST SO THAT HE COULD HAVE THE TIME... WHAT YOU MEAN YOU IN JAIL, KEVIN? ...TO SIT AND RE-EVALUATE HIS LIFE, OUR LIFE. Narrator: WHILE KEVIN IS LOCKED UP ON RIKERS ISLAND, JUST 8 MILES FROM HARLEM, LIFE AT THE BROWN HOME IS PEACEFUL. Donna: EVERYTHING JUST WENT BACK TO NORMAL. WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK AROUND ON EGGSHELLS. AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO REPORT EVERY SINGLE MOVEMENT I MAKE. Narrator: A YEAR LATER, KEVIN IS RELEASED EARLY ON PAROLE. I'M DOING GOOD. INCREDIBLY, DESPITE ALL THE LIES, DRUGS, AND ABUSE, DONNA TAKES HIM BACK WHEN HE VOWS TO STAY CLEAN. I'M GONNA GO UP THERE TO THE JANITORIAL. THEY GOT A LITTLE OPENING, AND I'M GONNA GO APPLY. AND KEVIN DOES... FOR A WHILE. HE WAS GOING TO CHURCH WITH US. HE WAS GOING TO BED AT NIGHT. HIS OLD FRIENDS WASN'T ALWAYS COMING AROUND, AND HE HAD A PAROLE OFFICER. Jonathan: I HONESTLY WAS HAPPY, LIKE, "WOW. OKAY, WELL, THIS IS THE KEVIN WE ALL KNOW ABOUT AND WE ALL LOVE." AND IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, LIKE, "WOW, HE REALLY, REALLY CHANGED." Narrator: DONNA FOOLS HERSELF INTO THINKING THAT KEVIN IS BACK TO BEING HER DREAM MAN. AND SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S FOOLED. WHEN KEVIN CAME HOME FROM PRISON, I SOFTENED UP A LITTLE. I GAVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. I KNOW A PERSON CAN CHANGE. Narrator: NOW THAT HE'S WON EVERYONE'S TRUST, HE PLAYS THE TRUMP CARD AND PROPOSES. YOU REALLY BELIEVED, DONNA, THAT KEVIN WAS THE ONE. I TELL YOU WHAT. IF SOMEONE WOULD HAVE BET ME IF I WAS GONNA BE WITH KEVIN, I'D BET YES. I WANTED THAT FAMILY. I STILL DESIRED THAT FAMILY. [ CHURCH BELLS RINGING ] AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF A TOXIC AND TUMULTUOUS RELATIONSHIP, DONNA AND KEVIN GET MARRIED. IN DONNA'S MIND, THE RITUAL WASHES ALL THE PAIN AWAY. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL WEDDING. SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL BRIDE. I WAS HOPEFUL IT WOULD BE A HAPPY ENDING. SHE HAD A PERFECT FAMILY. SHE WAS MARRIED, AND SHE HAD A HUSBAND. SHE HAD HER CHILDREN. Narrator: EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE FALLING INTO PLACE. KEVIN IS PLAYING THE PART OF THE GOOD HUSBAND AND FATHER, OR SO IT SEEMS TO DONNA AND HIS PAROLE OFFICER. HELLO, GOOD MORNING. HE GOES TO WHATEVER PROGRAM SHE SENDS HIM, HE'S WORKING. THE TIMES THAT SHE COMES, HE'S THERE. SHE COMES ON SUNDAY MORNING. WE'RE GETTING READY FOR CHURCH. SHE LIKES WHAT SHE SEES. [ HORNS HONKING ] Narrator: A YEAR AFTER GETTING OUT OF PRISON, KEVIN IS RELEASED FROM PAROLE EARLY. ARE YOU HAPPY? YES. YOU GET US SOME WINE. I'LL COOK DINNER. ALL RIGHT? AND ON THE VERY FIRST NIGHT OF HIS FREEDOM FROM NO MORE PAROLE, DONNA, WHAT HAPPENED? THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF OUR NIGHTMARE. BABY, IT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK. DONNA WANTS TO CELEBRATE WITH A NICE DINNER, BUT KEVIN HAS OTHER PLANS. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST LEAVING LIKE THIS. HE STAYED OUT ALL NIGHT PARTYING WITH THE OLD CREW. AND I JUST - I KNEW THAT THAT WAS THE MARK, THE MARK OF THE BEAST. Narrator: COMING UP, IS KEVIN'S LATEST BENDER THE LAST STRAW? THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SEEN HIM. Narrator: FOR EIGHT YEARS, DONNA BROWN HAS BEEN VICTIM TO HER HUSBAND KEVIN'S UNCONTROLLABLE RAGE. SHE THINKS HE'S FINALLY CHANGED UNTIL, ONCE AGAIN, HIS DARK SIDE SHOWS ITSELF STRONGER THAN EVER. SO WHEN HE GOT OFF PAROLE, HE DID A COMPLETE 180? HE STARTED SCREAMING AND YELLING - THE OLD KEVIN CAME BACK OUT FULL FORCE. CALM DOWN! YOU'RE GETTING ON MY NERVES! WAY MORE VIOLENT THAN BEFORE. [ SNIFFS ] EVEN NOW, DONNA REMAINS IN ABSOLUTE DENIAL. I WAS ASHAMED TO GET OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OF WHAT I FELT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD SAY, LIKE, "OH, THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RELATIONSHIP." AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE IT WITH AT LEAST ONE OF THE CHILDREN'S FATHER, BECAUSE I WASN'T PROUD OF MY PAST CHOICES. GET OUT MY FACE. Narrator: SHE TAKES THE ABUSE FOR TWO MORE YEARS, PUTTING UP WITH BEHAVIOR THAT THREATENS NOT ONLY HER LIFE, BUT THE LIVES OF HER SIX CHILDREN. Dr. Jordan: SHE'S PLAYING MIND GAMES WITH HERSELF, ADAPTING AND COMPLETELY AMELIORATING WHAT HE'S DOING INTO SOMETHING THAT'S HARMLESS. IT JUST KEEPS GOING AND GOING. SOMETHING BAD IS BOUND TO HAPPEN. IT JUST CAN'T GO ON THIS WAY FOREVER. Narrator: IN NOVEMBER 2006, DONNA PLANS A WEEKEND TO TRY AND REPAIR THEIR MARRIAGE. OKAY. SEE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE. SHE AND KEVIN ARRANGE FOR THE KIDS TO STAY WITH FAMILY. ON THE FIRST NIGHT, THEY HOST A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR SOME FRIENDS. CHEERS! WHOO! AND I WAS REALLY ANTICIPATING HAVING A NICE TIME. Narrator: EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT... UNTIL KEVIN'S BROTHER STARTS ARGUING WITH THE BIRTHDAY GIRL ABOUT THE MUSIC. YOU BETTER GET OUT MY FACE! SHUT UP! THAT'S WHY I HATE YOU AND YOUR MAMA! SO IT WASN'T TURNING OUT THE WAY WE PLANNED IT. Narrator: THE PARTY IS CLEARLY OVER. WHERE YOU GOING, KEVIN? YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE MY P.O. I CAN GO AND COME AS I PLEASE. BUT KEVIN'S NIGHT IS JUST GETTING STARTED. DONNA KNOWS IT COULD BE HOURS BEFORE HER HUSBAND COMES HOME, IF HE MAKES IT HOME AT ALL. SHE DECIDES TO GO TO BED. MEANWHILE, DONNA'S FRIEND WILLIAM RUNS INTO KEVIN AT A NEARBY CLUB. WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU CAN ALWAYS COME WITH ME. Riley: HE WAS DRINKING ALCOHOL, AND HE WAS BEING VERY LOUD IN THE CLUB. AND THEN THE OWNERS AND EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT HIM LIKE, "BILL, YOUR FRIEND IS GETTING A LITTLE OUTRAGEOUS." HE WAS REAL DIFFERENT THAT NIGHT. HE EVEN TRIED TO DO SOME DRUGS AT THE BAR. Narrator: KEVIN STARTS MAKING THREATS. Riley: I SENSED THAT HE WAS ON SOME DRUGS REAL HEAVY THAT NIGHT BESIDES THE ALCOHOL, BECAUSE HE WAS RANTING AND RAVING IN THERE. AND THEN ME AND HIM ALMOST GOT INTO IT. Narrator: THE BOUNCERS THROW AN ENRAGED KEVIN OUT OF THE CLUB. Riley: HE LEFT THERE WITH AN ATTITUDE, AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SEEN HIM. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Narrator: DONNA HEARS KEVIN STUMBLING BACK INTO THEIR APARTMENT. WHEN HE STARTS RANTING, SHE INSTANTLY KNOWS HE'S HIGH. BUT IT AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH. IT AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH. Donna: MY SPIRIT SAID, "DON'T GO TO SLEEP. "YOU NEED TO GET UP AND YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE AS SOON AS YOU CAN." AND THEN THAT OTHER PART OF ME LIKE, "NAH. "YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS A MILLION TIMES. HE'LL GO ON AND ON AND ON, AND HE'LL EVENTUALLY STOP." I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! Narrator: BUT DONNA CAN'T SLEEP. KEVIN SEEMS EVEN MORE OUT OF CONTROL THAN USUAL. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! Donna: THIS NIGHT WAS JUST DIFFERENT. I FELT IT IN MY STOMACH. I FELT THAT IT WASN'T RIGHT WITH HIM. AND HE WAS PUNCHING DOORS. AND I HEAR HIM SAY, "I'M GONNA KILL THIS BITCH. I'M GONNA HURT HER. I'M GONNA **** HER UP." Narrator: SOMEHOW, DONNA PUSHES HER FEARS ASIDE AND MANAGES TO FALL BACK TO SLEEP. IT'S SOMETHING SHE'LL REGRET FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. SHE WAKES UP TO A FIST HITTING HER IN THE FACE. [ SCREAMING ] AND THIS WAS THE FIRST THOUGHT THAT, "KEVIN DONE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN, AND SOMEBODY'S IN HERE ATTACKING ME," BECAUSE HE HAD NO REASON TO HIT ME. [ SCREAMING CONTINUES ] Narrator: BUT IT'S NO INTRUDER. KEVIN IS SAVAGELY BEATING HER. DONNA SQUEEZES KEVIN'S CROTCH HARD, HOPING HE'LL STOP. [ BOTH GRUNTING ] STARTLED, KEVIN STOPS TEMPORARILY, GIVING DONNA THE CHANCE TO ESCAPE TO THE LIVING ROOM. Donna: AND I SAID TO MYSELF, "THIS IS IT. YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL." I MEAN, I WAS GETTING THE POLICE. HE WAS GONNA GO TO JAIL. I COULDN'T TAKE NO MORE OF THAT. BEFORE I COULD EVEN GET TO THE PHONE, HE COMES BEHIND ME AND HE PUNCHES ME. HE HIT ME SO HARD THAT IT TOOK THE WIND FROM ME. [ GASPING ] Narrator: DONNA'S NOW FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE. [ SCREAMING ] AND HE GRABS ME FROM BEHIND, AND NOW HE'S TRYING TO PUNCH ME. [ GASPING ] AND HE STARTS TO CHOKE ME. [ COUGHING, GAGGING ] THE LOOK IN HIS FACE, HIS EYES WERE SO BIG. I COULD SEE VEINS. WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM, HE LOOKED LIKE A MONSTER. AND I REMEMBER JUST SINKING. AND IF HE GETS ME THERE AND I CAN'T BREATHE, IT'S OVER FOR ME. I MEAN, MY KIDS WERE FLASHING IN MY EYES. MY FAMILY, ME DYING. HE'S GONNA KILL ME. [ CHOKING ] Narrator: AS DONNA DESPERATELY FIGHTS TO GET KEVIN OFF HER, SHE REACHES FOR THE NEAREST OBJECT. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A KNIFE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF KNIFE IT IS AT THE TIME. I KNOW I GRAB IT AND I JUST - I POKE HIM WITH IT. Narrator: KEVIN COLLAPSES TO THE FLOOR. AND I JUST GOT UP, AND I RAN. Narrator: DONNA LOOKS BACK AT HER HUSBAND. HE'S BLEEDING BADLY, AND HE'S NOT MOVING. I SAW THE BLOOD, AND THEN I REALIZED THAT HE NEEDS HELP. Narrator: DONNA CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT SHE'S DONE. SOMEBODY! SHE'S FACED WITH AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE DECISION - GET OUT OR GO BACK AND TRY TO HELP KEVIN. IN THE END, SHE FOLLOWS HER INSTINCTS AS A NURSE. Donna: I CHOOSE TO COME BACK AND HELP HIM, AND I'M RUNNING AROUND. I'M LOOKING FOR STUFF, AND I'M TRAINED FOR THIS. AND I CAN'T EVEN THINK TO GO AND GET A CLEAN TOWEL. BUT I'M LOOKING AND I GRAB A SHIRT AND APPLY PRESSURE. I'M TALKING TO HIM, AND HE SAYS, "IT'S OKAY. IT'S OVER NOW." HE SAYS, "IT'S OVER NOW." Narrator: DESPITE EVERYTHING, DONNA STILL CAN'T LEAVE HIS SIDE. IN THIS MOMENT, SHE WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO SAVE HIS LIFE. Donna: I'M TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET HIM TO BREATHE, AND I WAS DIZZY, STILL IN PAIN. I'M SCARED. I'M LOOKING AT HIM LAYING HERE, AND I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: AFTER DONNA CALLS 911, AN AMBULANCE ARRIVES WITHIN MINUTES. THE KNIFE PIERCED KEVIN RIGHT THROUGH THE HEART. AN HOUR LATER, HE'S PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE HOSPITAL. DONNA IS ARRESTED AT THE SCENE AND LATER CHARGED WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. HER BAIL IS SET AT $15,000. Riley: IT DIDN'T SURPRISE ME NONE AT ALL THAT HE WOULD DO THAT TO HER. THAT SECOND PERSONALITY OF HIS WAS SOMETHING ELSE. HE WAS REAL EVIL. EVIL. WORDS CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE ALL THOSE EMOTIONS I'M GOING THROUGH. YOU NEVER MEANT TO KILL HIM? NO. I NEVER MEANT TO KILL HIM. NEVER. MY WHOLE WORLD JUST FLASHED BEFORE ME, MY WHOLE LIFE, LIKE I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING. Narrator: AFTER POSTING BAIL, DONNA HAS TO WAIT FOUR YEARS FOR HER CASE TO GO TO TRIAL. IF CONVICTED, SHE COULD FACE UP TO 25 YEARS IN PRISON. STILL TRYING TO WORK, STILL TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF MY KIDS, STILL TRYING TO HOLD MYSELF TOGETHER, 'CAUSE I'M SINKING. I'M SINKING SO FAST. Narrator: IN THE END, DONNA IS FOUND NOT GUILTY. THE JURY CONCLUDES THAT DONNA ACTED OUT OF SELF-DEFENSE. Donna: NO MATTER WHAT HIS FAMILY THINKS, NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, GOD KNOWS THAT I AM NOT A MURDERER, AND I HAD STUCK BY A MAN THAT DIDN'T DESERVE FIVE MINUTES OF MY TIME. WITH DONNA, YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO HAS ALL OF HER DREAMS WRAPPED UP IN THIS PERFECT FAMILY, THIS NUCLEAR FAMILY, THIS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD. AND YOU HAVE KEVIN, THE MANIPULATIVE DRUG DEALER WHO SEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY THE ROLE THAT DONNA NEEDS TO FULFILL HER LIFE. IT WAS THE PERFECT STORM. THAT PERFECT STORM ALMOST COST HER HER LIFE.
