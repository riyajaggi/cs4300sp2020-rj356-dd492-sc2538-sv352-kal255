 NO! WHEN LOVE GOES WRONG, A WOMAN CAN DO THE CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS 22-YEAR-OLD JAMIE SILVERSTRONE IS BEAUTIFUL, BLONDE, AND BEWITCHING. SHE TURNS HEADS WHEREVER SHE GOES. WHOO! YES! PEOPLE THINK IT'S SO EASY BEING ME. THEY LOOK AT ME NOW. THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, PFFT. YOU HAVE THE WORLD AT YOUR FEET." WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE YOU BY THE WAY YOU LOOK. EVEN BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, JAMIE TOOK CENTER STAGE. MY FIRST BOYFRIEND WAS THE CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM, AND I WAS THE CAPTAIN OF THE CHEERLEADING TEAM. HER LOOKS PROPELLED HER TO WIN THE MISS TEEN NEW JERSEY CONTEST. ALL THE ATTENTION FEEDS HER AMBITIONS OF FAME AND GLORY. DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. JAMIE'S PSYCHOLOGY IS VERY MUCH A PRODUCT OF HER VERY REAL, UNDENIABLE PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT CREATED A DEEP INSECURITY THAT NOBODY PAID ATTENTION TO HER BECAUSE SHE WAS SMART. SO, INTRINSICALLY, JAMIE ENDS UP NARCISSISTIC, BUT ALSO SOMEWHAT IMMATURE. AFTER GRADUATING, JAMIE'S REIGN AS POMPOM PRINCESS COMES TO AN END. WHAT'S UP, JAMIE? UM, I'M PREGNANT AGAIN. SHE UNEXPECTEDLY GETS PREGNANT TWICE. BY AGE 20, SHE HAS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN - TESSA AND MATTHEW. WHEN HER KIDS' FATHER WALKS OUT, JAMIE IS FORCED TO RAISE THEM ON HER OWN, AND ALL HER DREAMS OF A GLAMOROUS, EXCITING FUTURE ARE PUT ON HOLD. THOSE YEARS CHANGED ME BECAUSE NOW IT WASN'T JUST MYSELF. I HAD TO PUT MY KIDS FIRST. IN 2001, TO MAKE ENDS MEET, JAMIE GETS A JOB AT A TRENDY HEALTH CLUB. IT DOESN'T TAKE HER LONG TO REALIZE IT'S POTENTIAL HUSBAND TERRITORY. LOOK AT THAT GUY. SO HOT. AS SOON AS SHE LAYS EYES ON HANDSOME AND HUNKY CHARLIE CZERNIAWSKI, SHE'S DETERMINED TO HAVE HIM. HEY! OH, MY GOD. HEY! YOU! COME HERE! I ACTUALLY SAW HIM, AND I WAS AT THE FRONT DESK, AND I TOLD MY RECEPTIONIST THAT I WAS GONNA MARRY HIM, WHICH I NEVER DO. I HAVE A WEIRD PSYCHIC SENSE. I WAS WORKING OUT, AND SHE SAID SOMETHING, AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?" AND SHE SAID, "COME OVER HERE." WHAT DO YOU DO? WE TALKED FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND BASICALLY I WAS LIKE, "WHY DON'T WE GO OUT?" ...WITH ME SOMETIME? OH, YOU WANT MY NUMBER? YEAH. AND SHE WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT." I WAS LIKE, "REALLY?" ALL RIGHT, CHARLIE, GIVE ME YOUR HAND. AND THAT WAS IT. AFTER JUST ONE DATE, IT'S CLEAR THAT JAMIE AND CHARLIE HAVE SMOLDERING CHEMISTRY. BEFORE LONG, THE SIZZLING YOUNG COUPLE IS INSEPARABLE. HOW DID I FIND YOU? MMM. AND WAS IT LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT? YES, 100%. I WOULD STAY ON THE PHONE WITH HIM FOR HOURS DURING THE DAY. I WAS FULL STEAM AHEAD EVERY DAY FROM THAT DAY FORWARD. YOU KNOW, WE WERE TOGETHER ALL THE TIME. WE WERE YOUNG AND LIKED TO HAVE FUN. OKAY. THAT IS DISGUSTING. ALL RIGHT, SIGN HERE. 26-YEAR-OLD CHARLIE IS AN AMBITIOUS GUY. HE'S ALREADY A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FURNITURE DEALER... WHOO! LET'S GO, BABY! ...AND PART-TIME PARTY EMCEE AND DEEJAY. WITH HIS COMBINED JOBS, HE EASILY PULLS IN SIX FIGURES. CHARLIE PRIDES HIMSELF ON BEING THE LIFE OF THE PARTY AND LOOKING GOOD. BUT MOST OF ALL, HE LIKED SHOWING OFF JAMIE AND HIS BANK ACCOUNT. DID I SPOIL HER? ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. I SPOILED THE HELL OUT OF HER. I WANTED TO BE WITH HIM. I WANTED TO EXPERIENCE LIFE. I WANTED TO HAVE IT ALL. FOR JAMIE, CHARLIE IS TICKING ALL THE RIGHT BOXES - HANDSOME, RICH, EVEN PATERNAL. I COME FROM A GOOD FAMILY. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS WANTED A FAMILY. THEY'VE CHANGED THIS STUFF SINCE I WAS A KID. WHEN JAMIE CAME INTO MY LIFE AND BROUGHT THESE TWO CHILDREN ALONG, YOU KNOW, I JUST DIDN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH JAMIE. I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE CHILDREN, YOU KNOW? AND I JUST WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. NO. NO. IT SEEMED LIKE HE'D BE A GOOD DAD TO THEM? YES. IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT HIM THAT HE INSTANTLY LIKED YOUR KIDS. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE 100% CREDIT TO THAT. I TEND TO THINK OTHERWISE. CHARLES WANTED TO FEEL WANTED AND NEEDED. JAMIE AND CHARLIE AREN'T SHY ABOUT THEIR ATTRACTION TO EACH OTHER. THEY'RE MADLY IN LOVE AND WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW IT. THEY HAVE A WAY OF COMING TOGETHER AND CREATING THAT BARBIE AND KEN LOOK THAT REALLY APPEALS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, AND THEY ARE AWARE OF IT. THIS COUPLE IS NARCISSISTIC TO THE CORE. AND THEY'RE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS. YOU LIKE IT? CHARLIE AND JAMIE'S RELATIONSHIP IS ON THE FAST TRACK. THEY MOVE INTO A HOUSE WITH JAMIE'S KIDS IN FREEHOLD, A MIDDLE-CLASS NEW JERSEY SUBURB. WE WERE DATING MAYBE SIX, SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE WE MOVED IN TOGETHER. THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER ROOM THAN I HAD. I LIVED IN A ROOM WITH MY BROTHERS. SO, I PUT A QUEEN-SIZED BED IN THERE AND A SET OF BUNK BEDS FOR HER AND THE TWO CHILDREN TO COME LIVE WITH ME. ALL RIGHT. THERE IS THAT MAGNETISM, THAT FEELING THAT THEY COMPLETE EACH OTHER, BUT WHEN THINGS MOVE THAT QUICKLY IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, WITHOUT REALLY GETTING TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER, THINGS CAN REALLY ONLY END BADLY. BUT LIVING TOGETHER ISN'T ENOUGH FOR CHARLIE. WHEN IT COMES TO JAMIE, HE'S HOOKED, AND HE'S READY TO GO THE DISTANCE. WHAT ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT? LET ME SEE. HEY, DON'T GRAB. THAT'S RUDE. YOU'RE BEING VERY RUDE. OH, I'M BEING VERY RUDE? YEAH, YOU'RE BEING VERY RUDE. I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU GOT ME. IT'S JUST THIS. WANT TO DO THIS? IT WAS A SIMPLE PROPOSAL, YOU KNOW? I BOUGHT THE RING, AND I COULDN'T WAIT, AND IT WOUND UP BEING IN THE CAR IN THE MALL PARKING LOT. AND DO YOU, JAMIE... ON FEBRUARY 21, 2003, ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER THEIR FIRST DATE, JAMIE AND CHARLIE GET MARRIED. YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE. ...TWO, THREE! AHH! OOH! THEIR WEDDING IS A LAVISH, OVER-THE-TOP AFFAIR AT A LOCAL BANQUET HALL. MANY OF CHARLIE AND JAMIE'S FRIENDS WORK IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS, SO THE RECEPTION TURNS INTO A WILD PARTY. I HAD THREE DIFFERENT EMCEES INTRODUCE ME. MY AUNTS AND UNCLES AND STUFF GOT MAD 'CAUSE THERE WAS NO SLOW MUSIC. IT WAS LIKE A BIG NIGHTCLUB. IT WAS GREAT. EVERYBODY'S EITHER A DANCER OR A DEEJAY OR AN EMCEE, SO WE DIDN'T WANT THAT NIGHT TO END. STILL, NOT EVERYONE IS HAPPY ABOUT JAMIE AND CHARLIE'S MARRIAGE. CHARLIE'S FAMILY HAS SOME SERIOUS MISGIVINGS. MY FAMILY HATED IT. ME AND MY FATHER GOT INTO THE BIGGEST FIGHT OVER IT. FROM THE START, CHARLIE'S PARENTS HAVE BEEN WARNING THEIR SON ABOUT MOVING TOO FAST. THEY THINK JAMIE IS JUST SEEING DOLLAR SIGNS. ME GETTING INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN WITH TWO CHILDREN - SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE IDEA THAT SHE FOUND SOMEBODY TO TAKE CARE OF HER. DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS NOW? I JUST GOT MARRIED. PLEASE DON'T - PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. CHARLIE, LOOK AT ME. EVERYBODY CAN'T BE WRONG. MY FATHER'S A GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER, AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT NOW, EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAID ABOUT HER WHO SHE WAS... EVERYBODY I KNOW, EVERY ONE OF MY FRIENDS - EVERYBODY. AND I'D ALWAYS DEFEND HER. "NO, NO, YOU DON'T KNOW HER. NO, NO, PLEASE GIVE HER A CHANCE." EVERYBODY WAS RIGHT. COMING UP, THE HONEYMOON IS OVER WHEN CHARLIE STARTS ACTING VERY UNLIKE A MARRIED MAN. AND THEN HE GOT UP ON A BOX, AND HE JUST TOOK OFF HIS SHIRT, STARTED DANCING FOR THIS GROUP OF GIRLS. AFTER A RED-HOT ROMANCE, CHARLIE AND JAMIE CZERNIAWSKI GET MARRIED AND SETTLE DOWN WITH JAMIE'S TWO CHILDREN IN A NEW JERSEY SUBURB. THEY LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE-PERFECT COUPLE. BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING. IT'S JAMIE. IS CHARLIE OVER THERE RIGHT NOW? HIS CELLPHONE'S OFF OR SOMETHING. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, THE SUPPOSEDLY BLISSFUL NEWLYWEDS TURN ON EACH OTHER. HI, CHARLIE. IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU'RE NOT PICKING UP YOUR PHONE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE... JAMIE CLAIMS CHARLIE WAS DECEITFUL FROM DAY ONE. THERE WAS A FEW THINGS THAT STRUCK ME AS ODD. LIKE? HE'D SAY HE'S GOING ONE PLACE, AND HE WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND I WOULD KNOW IT. BUT I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE, "OKAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S NEW. HE'S AFRAID TO TELL ME." WHOO! ACCORDING TO JAMIE, CHARLIE ALSO SOMETIMES HAS TROUBLE ACTING LIKE A MARRIED MAN. WE WENT TO A CLUB ONE TIME. AND HE GOT UP ON A BOX, AND HE JUST TOOK OFF HIS SHIRT AND STARTED DANCING FOR THIS GROUP OF GIRLS. AND I'M LIKE... THEN I PAID NO MIND 'CAUSE I'M LIKE, "OH, HE'S A PERFORMER." BUT HE WAS WITH YOU. I MEAN, YOU WERE TOGETHER AT THE TIME. YEAH. BUT WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY IS, "HE'S FLIRTING WITH OTHER GIRLS." WELL, I THOUGHT HE WAS, BUT HE TOLD ME HE WASN'T. I DON'T KNOW. WHERE WERE YOU? THE COUPLE BICKERS OFTEN. AT FIRST, THEY DON'T SEE IT AS A DANGER SIGN. EVERYBODY ARGUES. LOOK AT YOU! EITHER IT'S OVER THE KIDS OR WHAT YOU WANT TO EAT OR WHAT YOU WANT TO WATCH OR WHATEVER IT IS. I WANT THE TRUTH! CHARLES AND I FOUGHT, AND WE ARGUED. BABY, BABY, COME HERE. I DIDN'T DEEM IT TO BE OUT OF THE ORDINARY BECAUSE NORMAL COUPLES - THEY FIGHT, THEY ARGUE, THEY CRY, THEY LAUGH. 'CAUSE IT SOUNDED NOT JUST LIKE HE WAS PERFECT, BUT THAT YOUR LIFE WAS PERFECT. I MEAN, EVERYONE THINKS YOU'RE THE PERFECT COUPLE, BARBIE AND KEN. MM-HMM. THEY DON'T WORK THROUGH THEIR PROBLEMS. THEY'RE SO BUSY WITH THEIR OUTWARD PERFORMANCE THAT THEY NEVER JUST BARE THEIR SOULS AND BE HONEST WITH ONE ANOTHER. SO, IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE CONFLICT KEEPS FESTERING AND GROWING. THE ARGUMENTS GET MORE AND MORE HEATED. DESPITE THE FIGHTING, JAMIE AND CHARLIE AREN'T ABOUT TO GIVE UP ON THEIR MARRIAGE. IT DOESN'T HURT THAT CHARLIE'S BUSINESSES ARE TAKING OFF IN A BIG WAY. TWO YEARS AFTER THE WEDDING, HIS INCOME DOUBLES. THE FAMILY MOVES INTO A SPACIOUS HOME IN THE UPSCALE TOWNSHIP OF JACKSON, NEW JERSEY. HEY. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU UP. YOU BEEN AT THE GYM THIS LONG? YEP. CHARLIE PUSHES JAMIE TO QUIT HER JOB. WHEN YOU'RE BRINGING IN $20,000 A MONTH, IT'S OKAY. WHY SHOULD YOU WORK? YOU CAN STILL DO EVERYTHING AND BE A MOM. HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO WORK. YOU HAD WORKED SO HARD SINCE YOUR KIDS WERE BORN. WAS IT NICE TO BE ABLE TO BE A STAY-AT-HOME MOM FOR A CHANGE? YEAH, BUT ONCE YOU'RE A CERTAIN WAY, IT'S LIKE GOING ON VACATION. HOW LONG CAN YOU BE ON VACATION BEFORE YOU'RE BORED? WITH SO MUCH CASH FLOWING IN, CHARLIE'S ABLE TO BUY JAMIE AND HER TWO KIDS ANYTHING THEY WANT. IT WAS TWO YEARS OF HARD-CORE LIKE, JUST, YOU KNOW, US HAVING FUN ALL THE TIME, LIVING THE FAST LIFE - FAST CARS, FAST TIMES, YOU KNOW, VACATIONS, JUST PARTYING, WHATEVER YOU WANTED. $100 JEANS? NO PROBLEM. YOU WANT - DON'T BUY ONE. BUY THREE. DUDE, I'M JUST LIVING LIFE, MAN. I'M ON THE TOP OF THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. YOU NEVER THINK IT'S GONNA END. YOU KNOW? SO, ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU SPEND $1,000 TODAY. BUT YOU'RE MAKING $3,000 TOMORROW. IT WAS A CRAZY LIFE. BUT LIVING THE HIGH LIFE COMES AT A PRICE. CHARLIE IS AWAY WORKING ALL THE TIME, AND JAMIE FEELS NEGLECTED. SHE'S NO LONGER THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. CHARLES WAS A GOOD FRIEND, NOT A GOOD HUSBAND. A GOOD PROVIDER, BUT NOT A - NOT A HUSBAND. JAMIE AND CHARLIE DO THEIR BEST TO HIDE THEIR MARITAL PROBLEMS FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THEY EVEN DECIDE TO OPEN A NEW BUSINESS TOGETHER. WHEN I HAD TOLD HIM THAT I WANTED TO WORK, HE'S LIKE, "LET'S JUST OPEN A TANNING SALON," 'CAUSE HE ALWAYS WANTED ONE. AND I JUST WENT ALONG WITH IT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO TAN. SHE KEPT SAYING TO ME, "I WANT TO OPEN UP A TANNING SALON. I WANT TO OPEN UP A TANNING SALON." I SAID, "YOU REALLY WANT A TANNING SALON, JAMIE?" SHE SAYS, "YEAH." THAT'S HOW THE TANNING SALON CAME ABOUT. SHE WANTED IT, AND I WANTED TO MAKE HER HAPPY, SO I DID. I FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO IT. WHAT'S GOING ON NOW? THIS - THESE SCREWS. THEY'RE GETTING STRIPPED. THE CZERNIAWSKIS HIRE AMY GAUSLIN TO WORK RECEPTION. I SAW YOU HAD A "WANTED" SIGN OUT THERE. OH, ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A JOB? YEAH. PRETTY SOON, AMY STARTS BABYSITTING FOR THEM, TOO. WHEN I FIRST MET THEM, I THOUGHT THEY WERE THE HAPPIEST COUPLE, NOTHING COULD GO WRONG. YOU KNOW, CHARLIE WORKED VERY LONG DAYS. JAMIE WAS AT THE TANNING SALON IN THE MORNING. HEY! HI. YOU'RE BACK EARLY. I WATCHED THE KIDS, AND THAT'S HOW I BECAME MORE INVOLVED WITH THE FAMILY. BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT AT ANY POINT THEY WERE FIGHTING, ARGUING. BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR AMY TO REALIZE THAT THE PERFECT FAMILY IS NOT SO PERFECT AFTER ALL. CHARLIE? YEAH? I DIDN'T KNOW NOBODY WAS GONNA BE HERE. ONE NIGHT I HAD GONE BACK TO THE TANNING SALON TO GET THE KEY. CHARLIE WAS SLEEPING ON THE COUCH BECAUSE THEY GOT INTO A FIGHT AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME. I DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP FIGHTING IN FRONT OF THE KIDS, SO I DECIDED TO COME OVER HERE. OH, MAN. SORRY, CHARLIE. DIDN'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS. I DIDN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. I JUST SAID, "OKAY, YOU KNOW, I'LL BE HERE IN THE MORNING," BECAUSE JAMIE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE SALON. YOU DO THIS EVERY TIME! JAMIE SAYS THAT THREE YEARS INTO THE MARRIAGE, CHARLIE STARTS HAVING A HARD TIME CONTROLLING HIS ANGER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! THEIR FIGHTS ARE NO LONGER CONFINED TO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. THEY SPILL OUT INTO THE PUBLIC EYE, EVEN AT THEIR KIDS' SCHOOL EVENTS. JUST WALK AWAY! HE'S YELLED. HE'S SCREAMED. NOT EVERYONE THINKS CHARLIE IS THE PROBLEM. I'M NOT GONNA SAY CHARLIE NEVER ROSE HIS VOICE TO JAMIE. HE HAD TO BECAUSE SHE WAS ALWAYS YELLING AT HIM. SO FOR HIM TO GET HIS WORD OVER, HE'D HAVE TO YELL BACK. DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME! JAMIE! THE FIGHTS AT HOME ARE ALSO GETTING WORSE. YOU'RE MY WIFE! YOU UNDERSTAND ME?! YOU'RE MY WIFE! YOU'RE MINE! YOU BELONG TO ME! OPEN THE DOOR, JAMIE. OPEN THE DOOR, JAMIE. HE LOVES JAMIE AND THE KIDS DEEPLY. SO, FOR HER, PUTTING HIM DOWN AND CALLING HIM IDIOT AND YELLING AT HIM AND HIM GETTING UP EARLY, 5:00, 6:00 IN THE MORNING, DRAINING HIM MORE THAN HE ALREADY IS DRAINED FROM WORKING SO MUCH, IT REALLY MADE ME HURT FOR CHARLIE. THE NOW NEARLY DAILY BATTLES BEGIN TO DOUSE THE FLAMES ON THEIR ONCE-SIZZLING HOT ROMANCE. YOU KNOW, ONCE IN A WHILE, I HEARD "I LOVE YOU" COME OUT. NEVER DID SHE EVER REALLY, LIKE, KISS - LIKE, THAT I SAW, KISS OR HUG. IT WAS JUST A LOT OF PUTTING HIM DOWN. YO, WE SHOULD BE ON THAT SHOW. PBHT. YEAH. I'M NOT JOKING. NO, WE ARE NOT GONNA BE ON THIS "WIFE SWAP." I THINK WE'RE PERFECT FOR IT. BUT CHARLIE HAS AN IDEA THAT MIGHT REKINDLE THE SPARK AND CAPITALIZE ON THEIR LOVE OF THE LIMELIGHT. ...ON THE TV FOR THE "WIFE SWAP" THING. WHEN CHARLIE SEES A CASTING CALL FOR THE HIT REALITY SERIES "WIFE SWAP," HE JUMPS AT THE CHANCE TO REVIVE THEIR MARRIAGE. ...TO A FARM OR BY THE SNOW... AT THE SAME TIME, HE SEEMS A LITTLE TOO EAGER TO EMBARRASS HIS WIFE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION. SHE ALWAYS WORE HIGH HEELS. JAMIE WORE HIGH HEELS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SNOW. YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T MATTER. SHE ALWAYS WORE HEELS, ALWAYS. AND I SAID, "I HOPE THEY SEND YOU TO A FARM WHERE YOU GOT TO SHOVEL CRAP." ALL RIGHT, MY NAME'S CHARLIE. MY WIFE - SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. SHE'D LOOK GREAT ON TV. HER NAME'S JAMIE. CHARLIE HAS NO IDEA THAT HE'S JUST LIT THE FUSE ON THEIR FLOUNDERING MARRIAGE. AND OUR FATE WAS SEALED. COMING UP, THE COUPLE'S FIGHTS TURN PHYSICAL AS THEIR LUST FOR ATTENTION BACKFIRES. THE COPS CAME IN. WE WERE ARGUING, WE WERE SCREAMING, AND SOMEBODY HAD TO GO. AFTER THREE YEARS OF MARRIAGE AND FINANCIAL SUCCESS, JEALOUSY AND ANGER ARE SLOWLY TEARING CHARLIE AND JAMIE CZERNIAWSKI APART. I THINK THAT WE'D BE GOOD CANDIDATES FOR THAT SHOW. OH, MY GOD. CHARLIE CONTACTS THE CASTING PRODUCERS OF THE REALITY SHOW "WIFE SWAP," A TOP-RATED SERIES WHERE TWO DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT COUPLES SWAP HOMES AND SPOUSES. HE FANTASIZES IT WILL MAKE THINGS BETTER. OH! HEY, YEAH, I'M... HELLO? YEAH, THIS IS HIM. THE NEXT DAY, THE PRODUCER CALLS ME AND SAYS, "CHARLIE, WE LOVED YOUR MESSAGE." YEAH? YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. YEAH, YOU CAN COME HERE. "WE'RE GONNA SEND A CAMERA CREW OUT TO DO A TEST SHOOT." ALL RIGHT! I AM EXCITED. YOU BOTH WERE GUNG HO ABOUT IT, YEAH? I DON'T WANT TO SAY I WAS GUNG HO. I ALWAYS HAVE THAT ATTITUDE ANYWAY, LIKE, "WHATEVER." WHOO! WE'RE GONNA BE MONEY, BABY! ANY COUPLE THAT EVEN MUTUALLY AGREES TO BE ON A REALITY SHOW LIKE "WIFE SWAP" HAS TO GO INTO IT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO AIR THEIR DIRTY LAUNDRY IN PUBLIC AND THAT IN THE END, THERE ARE GOING TO BE VERY REAL CONSEQUENCES FROM DOING SO. THE CZERNIAWSKIS SPEND THE NEXT MONTH FILMING THE EPISODE. THIS IS GREAT. YEAH! THAT'S NOT EVEN HOW THAT WENT. HEY, THE CAMERA CAN ONLY CAPTURE WHAT IT SEES. NO. BUT WHEN THE SHOW PREMIERES, JAMIE IS HORRIFIED AT THE WAY SHE'S BEEN PORTRAYED. THAT'S NOT EVEN WHAT HAPPENED. OHH-WHEE. THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SAY. SHE REALLY CAME DOWN ON ME HARD ON THAT. SHE WAS LIKE, "HOW COULD YOU ALLOW THEM TO MAKE EVERYBODY BELIEVE THAT I SLEEP TILL NOON, THAT YOU DO ALL THE WORK AROUND THE HOUSE?" I'M LIKE, "PRETTY MUCH THAT'S WHAT'S TRUE. ALL RIGHT, MAYBE YOU DON'T SLEEP TO NOON, BUT 10:30." THIS IS GOOD TV. I'M NOT GONNA WATCH THIS. I'M NOT GONNA WA- NO. WHERE YOU GOING? I CAN'T WATCH THIS ANYMORE. AGAIN, I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY PERCEIVE ME AS. THERE'S MORE SUBSTANCE TO THAT, AND INITIALLY THAT'S HOW I WAS APPROACHED, THAT THAT'S THE ROUTE THEY WERE GONNA GO. AND THEY DIDN'T. THEY PRESENTED YOU AS BEING COMPLETELY - A BIMBO. YOU MUST BE DOING IT WRONG, MAN. I DON'T KNOW. YOU GOT TO THINK LIKE A WOMAN. WHILE JAMIE CONTINUES TO FUME, CHARLIE IS THRILLED WITH HIS NEW CELEBRITY STATUS. WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO ON THAT SHOW? I DON'T KNOW. I WAS JUST MYSELF. THEY JUST FOLLOWED US AROUND WITH CAMERAS, AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST DID WHAT I NORMALLY DO. I HAD THE GUYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SAYING, YOU KNOW, "WE HATE YOU. MY WIFE KEEPS SAYING, 'WHY AREN'T YOU MORE LIKE HIM?'" PEOPLE RECOGNIZE US SOMETIMES. I MEAN, IT WAS JUST REALITY TV. WELL, AT LEAST YOU LOOKED GOOD ON IT. IN THE END, THE COUPLE'S VAULT INTO THE SPOTLIGHT DIDN'T JUMP-START THEIR MARRIAGE. IT DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE. I'M A PERFECT GENTLEMAN. I AM, YOU KNOW... HEY, BABY. HOW YOU DOING? YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, BY THE WAY. WHO WAS THAT? JAMIE IS IRRITATED BY HER HUSBAND'S DELIGHT IN HIS 15 MINUTES OF FAME. SHE WAS SOME GIRL THAT I WAS JUST TALKING TO. SO, YOU'RE JUST GOING INTO BARS THESE DAYS AND PICKING UP FANS? NOW THE MARRIAGE'S DOWNWARD SPIRAL STARTS PICKING UP STEAM. I TOLD YOU, SHE RECOGNIZED ME FROM - DON'T DO THIS. JAMIE SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, I WAS CHEATING ON HER. DO NOT TALK TO OTHER GIRLS, OKAY? DO NOT TALK TO ME LIKE I'M A CHILD. DO NOT TALK TO ME LIKE I'M A CHILD. THERE WAS NOT ONE THING THAT EVER CAME OUT THAT SAID I WAS CHEATING ON HER. JAMIE IS A LIAR. HE WAS ALWAYS LYING. HE WAS LYING SO MUCH THAT I QUESTIONED THINGS THAT I BELIEVED AND I WAS QUESTIONING MYSELF. THE LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN THE HANDSOME HUNK AND THE BEAUTY QUEEN IS TURNING INTO SOMETHING UGLY, AND THERE'S NO GOING BACK. THEY SIMPLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THEIR WORDS TO COMMUNICATE THEIR UNHAPPINESS WITH EACH OTHER AND THEIR UNHAPPINESS WITH THE STATE OF THEIR LIVES. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU STILL WANT TO FIGHT ABOUT THIS. WHY IS IT EVERY TIME WE GO OUT, THIS HAS TO HAPPEN? CONVERSATION IS REPLACED BY BACK TALK AND BICKERING. BECAUSE OF YOU! WHAT HAVE I DONE?! IT'S A RAZOR'S EDGE THAT'S ABOUT TO GET EVEN SHARPER. AMY GAUSLIN IS BABYSITTING WHEN SHE HEARS THE COUPLE RETURN HOME. I WAS WATCHING THE KIDS, HEARD JAMIE AND CHARLIE PULL UP, SAW THE LIGHTS REALLY LATE - I WANT TO SAY 2:00, 3:00 IN THE MORNING - HEARD THEM ARGUING OUTSIDE FOR A WHILE. I HEARD THE CAR DOOR SHUT. I ACTUALLY WENT OVER AND PEEKED OUT THE WINDOW. THEY WERE, I GUESS, ARGUING BEHIND THE TRUCK 'CAUSE I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING. ...DIFFERENT, JAMIE! YOU'VE CHANGED! TO AMY, IT'S NOT CLEAR WHO STARTED THE FIGHT OR WHAT THEY'RE FIGHTING ABOUT. SHE CLAIMS THAT HE PUSHED HER UP AGAINST THE TRAILER AND SMACKED HER IN THE HEAD, BUT I DIDN'T SEE IT, SO I CAN'T SAY THAT IT HAPPENED. JAMIE! JAMIE! THEN THEY WENT UP TO THE BEDROOM, STILL ARGUING. OH, SUCH A BIG MAN NOW, CHARLIE, AREN'T YOU? OH, EVER SINCE THE SHOW, EVER - WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU - OOPS. I HEARD A CRASH UPSTAIRS, AND THERE WAS A DRAWER BROKEN OFF. CHARLIE WAS LEAVING THE BEDROOM. I AM CALLING THE POLICE. YOU ARE OUT OF CONTROL. WE'RE CALLING THE POLICE. GET IN HERE. JAMIE WAS TELLING ME TO CALL THE COPS, CALL THE COPS. IT WAS JUST A LOT OF YELLING, AND JAMIE HAD PUT HERSELF AGAINST THE DOOR, HOLDING IT SO HE COULDN'T GET IN, YOU KNOW, TO TALK TO HER. STOP POUNDING ON THE DOOR! YOU KNOW, AND SHE'S SCREAMING AT ME TO CALL THE COPS. COME ON IN. WE GOT CALL ABOUT... ME AND HER WERE ARGUING. AND THE COPS CAME IN. WE WERE ARGUING, WE WERE SCREAMING, AND SOMEBODY HAD TO GO. HE HURT ME! HE IS PHYSICALLY ABUSING ME! OH, DON'T EVEN - I AM THE VICTIM, CHARLIE! HEY! HEY! HEY! CALM DOWN! YOU LYING... YOU **** TAKE HIM AWAY! TAKE HIM AWAY! AND THEY WOUND UP TAKING ME. AND THERE WASN'T A MARK ON HER. THE KIDS NOW WERE UP AT THIS POINT, AND SO I WENT IN THERE. I SAID, YOU KNOW, "EVERYTHING'S OKAY. MOM AND DAD JUST GOT INTO A FIGHT. YOU KNOW, GO BACK TO SLEEP." BUT, OF COURSE, THEY COULDN'T SLEEP WITH THE YELLING AND THE ARGUING. THEY TOOK PICTURES OF JAMIE TO FIND OUT, YOU KNOW, IF THOSE MARKS WERE HANDS. CAN YOU POINT TO WHERE IT WAS? I THINK IT WAS LIKE RIGHT HERE. TAKE YOUR HAND OFF FOR ME, MA'AM. THANK YOU, MA'AM. JAMIE FILES A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST CHARLIE THAT NIGHT. HELLO? IS EVERYTHING OKAY? YEAH. EVERYTHING'S FINE. I'LL BE BACK LATER. THE NEXT DAY WHEN I CAME TO BABYSIT, IT WAS LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. JAMIE AND CHARLIE'S BURYING OF PROBLEMS IS JUST ANOTHER POISON EATING AWAY AT THEIR MARRIAGE. THE CHARGES EVENTUALLY GET DROPPED, BUT UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE WHO SIT DOWN AND WORK THROUGH IT AND MAYBE EVEN SEEK OUT MARRIAGE COUNSELING OR OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL HELP TO FIGURE OUT "HOW DO WE STOP THIS CYCLE?", JAMIE AND CHARLIE JUST ACTED LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED, AS THEY SEEMED TO ALWAYS DO WITH ANYTHING UNPLEASANT IN THEIR LIVES. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? YOU GONNA HIT ME WITH A BAT WITH EVERYBODY WATCHING? YEAH! SURE ENOUGH, IGNORING THEIR PROBLEMS DOESN'T MAKE THEM GO AWAY. ACCORDING TO CHARLIE, JAMIE BECOMES INCREASINGLY ERRATIC AND VIOLENT. JAMIE GOT PISSED OFF, CAME AT ME WITH A BASEBALL BAT. SHE HAS A VERY, VERY BAD TEMPER, A VERY, VERY BAD TEMPER, AND SHE'S THE TYPE THAT FELT LIKE, YOU KNOW, "I'M THE GIRL. I CAN HIT YOU." COMING UP, IS THE WORST YET TO COME? JUST HOW FAR IS AN EX-CHEERLEADER WILLING TO GO? EVERY TIME WE GO OUT, THIS HAS TO HAPPEN. NEW JERSEY COUPLE JAMIE AND CHARLIE CZERNIAWSKI'S FIVE-YEAR MARRIAGE IS ON A COLLISION COURSE. SINCE THEY WERE ON THE REALITY SHOW "WIFE SWAP," THEIR FIGHTS HAVE BECOME EVEN MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE. GOOD THING THEY STILL HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY TO EASE THE PAIN... UNTIL THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS THREATENS TO FINISH THEM OFF. THEN THE ECONOMY HIT. YOU NEED $12,000 A MONTH TO PAY YOUR BILLS, JUST TO PAY YOUR BILLS, AND THAT'S THAT'S JUST TO GET BY. AND YOU CAN ONLY SURVIVE SO LONG TRYING TO MANAGE THE TANNING SALON, ON THE WEEKENDS, BE AN ENTERTAINER, AND THEN ON SUNDAYS, YOU'RE TRYING TO GO TO THE FLEA MARKET AND HUSTLE MATTRESSES, AND THEN ON TOP OF IT ALL, BE A HUSBAND AND BE A FATHER. YOU KNOW, AND THEN YOU'RE ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL, AND THAT'S WHEN THINGS COME CRUMBLING DOWN. DO YOU NOT REALIZE WHERE WE LIVE AND HOW MANY KIDS WE HAVE? CHARLIE CAN NO LONGER SUPPLY JAMIE WITH THE LIFE OF LUXURY SHE'S USED TO. IN THE SAME WEEK, CHARLIE LOSES HIS FURNITURE BUSINESS, AND THE COUPLE IS FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR TANNING SALON. IN DESPERATION, THEY PUT THEIR UPSCALE HOUSE ON THE MARKET. WHY YOU ACTING SO QUIET? WELL, WE'RE MOVING OUT OF OUR HOUSE, RIGHT? IT'S NOT A TIME TO BE SUPER EXCITED OR ANYTHING. YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING - SHE SAID, "WHATEVER YOU DO, JUST DON'T LOSE THE HOUSE." BUT WHEN YOU'RE NOT MAKING THE MONEY AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE HOUSE ANYMORE, YOUR CAR'S GETTING REPOED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT... ...ALWAYS ALL MY F- NO ONE HAS EVER MADE ME THE WAY THAT YOU MAKE ME! HE'S PUNCHED HOLES IN WALLS. HE'S YELLED. HE'S SCREAMED. HE'S HURT ME. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. THE DISCORD BETWEEN CHARLIE AND JAMIE HAS BEEN FESTERING SINCE THE "WIFE SWAP" EPISODE, AND THEN WHEN THEY SUFFER FINANCIAL RUIN, WELL, THIS CAUSES A POWDER KEG OF PENT-UP EMOTIONS THAT REALLY HAS NO OPTION EXCEPT TO EXPLODE. AT THIS POINT, THERE'S NO DOUBT THE CZERNIAWSKI MARRIAGE IS BEYOND REPAIR. AND AS IF THINGS AREN'T BAD ENOUGH, CHARLIE STARTS TO SUSPECT THAT JAMIE'S KEEPING SECRETS FROM HIM. I'M EXHAUSTED. WHEN YOU WALK IN AND SHE'S ON THE COMPUTER AND YOU SEE HER ON THE COMPUTER AND AS YOU WALK OVER, SHE'S CLICKS OUT OF IT. "WHAT WAS THAT?" LOCKED. EVERYTHING HAS A PASSWORD ON IT. YO, JAMIE, IT'S ASKING ME FOR A PASSWOR- WHAT'S YOUR PASSWORD? YOUR PHONE IS LOCKED, TOO. WHAT IS WITH IS THIS, EVERYTHING'S LOCKED UP? IT'S LIKE I'M IN SING SING. IT'S, UH - IT'S - I CAN'T GET IN 'CAUSE IT HAS A LOCK ON IT. THEN YOU QUESTION IT - "WHY IS THERE A LOCK ON YOUR PHONE?" "OH, IT'S SO - I DON'T WANT THE KIDS GOING THROUGH MY PHONE." WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO ON YOUR PHONE, MAKE LONG-DISTANCE PHONE CALLS? WHEN YOU HAVE TWO SEPARATE FACEBOOKS AND TWO SEPARATE MySpaces AND YOU PUT LOCKS ON YOUR PHONES, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THE MARRIED LIFE, THE FAMILY WITH ALL - AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR SINGLE LIFE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE BRINGING ME A DRINK! AT THIS POINT, JAMIE IS PROBABLY DONE WITH THE MARRIAGE, AND SHE SIMPLY IS UNPREPARED TO DEAL WITH A NEW LIFE AND NEW WORLD, ESPECIALLY WITH TWO CHILDREN, BUT WITH NO HUSBAND. SO, INSTEAD OF JUST PUTTING THE CHIPS DOWN AND SAYING, "CHARLIE, LET'S TALK ABOUT DIVORCE," SHE JUST GOES AND STARTS BUILDING A SEPARATE LIFE, A LEVEL OF SECRECY THAT CAN ONLY DRIVE A WEDGE FURTHER INTO THE DISINTEGRATING MARRIAGE. MAY 28, 2009, WOULD BECOME A FATEFUL DAY. JAMIE HAS PLANS FOR A GIRLS NIGHT OUT AT A JERSEY SHORE TIKI BAR. IT'S JUST LIKE A GIRLS THING. I DON'T KNOW. SHE WANTED TO GO OUT, AND I KNEW SHE WAS CHEATING AT THAT POINT IN MY MIND. I ALREADY KNEW IT. I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW? MAYBE I'LL - MAYBE I'LL COME WITH YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU WANT TO COME? CHARLIE SEES IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH JAMIE RED-HANDED. THEY PICK UP THEIR FRIEND STEPHANIE AND HEAD FOR THE SHORE. SO, I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, WHO ELSE WE GETTING?" "OH, NO, NO, THAT'S IT, JUST STEPHANIE." "WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE GIRLS?" "OH, WE'RE GONNA MEET EVERYBODY THERE." BUT WHEN THEY GET TO THE TIKI BAR, THERE'S JUST ONE PERSON WAITING FOR THEM, AND HE'S NOT A GIRL. I WANTED TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIEND VINCE. THIS IS STEPHANIE. HOW ARE YOU? AND, UH, THIS IS CHARLIE, MY HUSBAND. HEY, VINCE. AND WHEN SHE SAID "HUSBAND," HIS FACE WAS LIKE... IT'S, UH, NICE TO MEET YOU. I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING, DIDN'T SAY A WORD. CHARLIE CLAIMS JAMIE SPENDS THE REST OF THE NIGHT GETTING DRUNK AND FLIRTING WITH HER FRIEND VINCE AND OTHER MEN IN THE BAR. JAMIE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE, DRINKING, SHOTS OVER HERE, DOING THIS OVER THERE WITH THESE PEOPLE. A FEW HOURS LATER, THE CZERNIAWSKIS LEAVE. THEY DROP STEPHANIE OFF ON THEIR WAY HOME. BYE. SEE YOU LATER. SCREW YOU, CHARLIE. SERIOUSLY, I'M DONE. WHAT HAPPENED? IS EVERYTHING OKAY? YEAH, IT'S FINE. SHE JUST - SHE JUST DRANK TOO MUCH. AFTER THE BABYSITTER LEAVES, CHARLIE HEADS UPSTAIRS TO BED. I GO IN THE BATHROOM. I CHANGE. LIKE 10 MINUTES GOES BY. AND SHE'S STILL NOT UPSTAIRS. SO I DECIDED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS. YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT ON IN THE BATHROOM. AS I'M WALKING TO THE BATHROOM, YOU CAN HEAR WHISPERING, BUT ARGUING. SO NOW I JUST HAVE THE MOST UNEASY FEELING IN MY STOMACH. SO, I'M PACING IN FRONT OF THE DOOR - PACING. "WHAT SHOULD I DO?" I EVEN PUT MY EAR UP TO THE DOOR. ACCORDING TO JAMIE... ...CHARLIE GOES BALLISTIC. WHO YOU TALKING TO? NOBODY. WHO YOU TALKING TO?! STEPHANIE. GIVE ME YOUR PHONE. GIVE ME YOUR PHONE, OR I WILL PUT YOU IN THE **** ROSE GARDEN. NO! HE STARTED GRABBING ME, TRYING TO GRAB MY PHONE. HE SAID, "GIVE ME YOUR PHONE." HE STARTED WITH, HE WAS GONNA KILL ME. LOOKS LIKE VINCE. LET'S CALL VINCE! HE DRAGGED ME OUT OF THE BATHROOM. HELLO? HELLO?! HE SOUNDS LIKE A REAL BOY SCOUT. HELLO?! YOU KNOW, WHATEVER HE WAS SAYING, I JUST REMEMBER HIM - "I'LL KILL YOU. IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, NO ONE CAN." AAH! I FINALLY BROKE FREE. WHERE YOU GOING? WHERE YOU GONNA GO? WHERE YOU GONNA GO? NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM NOW, JAMIE. THEN HE CAUGHT ME AGAIN, AND HE STARTED CHOKING ME THERE. HE WAS CHOKING ME SO HARD THAT HE LIFTED ME OFF THE GROUND. IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, NO ONE WILL! JAMIE FRANTICALLY REACHES BEHIND HER AND FINDS A WEAPON. I'LL KILL YOU! GET OFF. I KNEW WHERE THE KNIFE BLOCK WAS. I GRABBED IT, HOPING IT WAS GONNA SCARE HIM, AND IT DID SCARE HIM FOR A MINUTE. STAY BACK. SCREW YOU, CHARLIE... JAMIE AND CHARLIE CZERNIAWSKI ARE BACK HOME AFTER A NIGHT OF BOOZING ON THE JERSEY SHORE. JAMIE CLAIMS CHARLIE GOES CRAZY WITH JEALOUSY AFTER OVERHEARING HER TALKING ON THE PHONE WITH HER FRIEND VINCE. SHE SAYS HE WAS THE AGGRESSOR AND SHE HAD TO DEFEND HERSELF. STAY AWAY. WHOA. GET OFF. A GIRL WHO LIKES TO PLAY WITH KNIVES. I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL KILL YOU. OH, YEAH, COME ON. OH, I BELIEVE IT, BABY. LET'S GO. OH, YOU WANT TO KILL EACH OTHER? YOU WANT TO KILL EACH OTHER? COME ON, BABY! LET'S GO! LET'S DO THIS TONIGHT! AAH! I HAD IT IN MY RIGHT HAND, AND HE WAS ON TOP OF ME. I COULDN'T SEE, BUT I COULD HEAR, AND THEN I COULDN'T HEAR, BUT I COULD SEE. AAH! I JUST REMEMBER TURNING MY HEAD AND... AND RIGHT IN HIS, UM, LEFT BICEP. AAH! JAMIE PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER HUSBAND'S ARM. THE KNIFE HITS AN ARTERY, AND CHARLIE'S BLOOD STARTS SPRAYING EVERYWHERE. AT LEAST, THAT'S THE WAY SHE SAW IT. CHARLIE TELLS THE ENTIRE STORY A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. I GRABBED THE DOOR. IT'S NOT EVEN LOCKED. OPEN UP THE DOOR, AND SHE'S STANDING IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR. SHE'S JUST - YOU KNOW THAT DEER-IN-HEADLIGHTS LOOK? THAT'S THE LOOK SHE GIVES ME. AND I LOOK AT HER, AND I'M LIKE, "WHO ARE YOU ON THE PHONE WITH, JAMIE?" THIS IS WHY I HATE YOU. I WANT A DIVORCE. WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?! I SAID, "YOU'RE CHEATING ON ME." I SAID, "YOU'RE CHEATING." I SAID, "WHO YOU ON THE PHONE WITH, JAMIE? YOU'RE CHEATING ON ME." NO! GIVE IT TO ME. NO! GIVE IT - UNH! "VINCE." HELLO? HELLO?! SO, I JUST TAKE OFF. I JUST LEAVE THE BATHROOM AND LEAVE HER IN THE BATHROOM. CHARLIE! AND I'M TRYING TO CALL HIM BACK. I'M LIKE, "HELLO? HELLO? HELLO?" AND HE KEEPS HANGING UP. "HELLO? HELLO?" HE KEEPS HANGING UP. "HELLO?" HE KEEPS HANGING UP. I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE MESSAGES. SHE COMES FROM BEHIND AND WAS ABLE LIKE - JUMPED, LIKE, ON MY BACK AND WAS ABLE TO GET THE PHONE OUT OF MY HAND. AAH! GIVE ME THE PHONE! STOP FIGHTING! AAH! SHE TAKES THE KNIFE AND THEN STABS ME THIS WAY AND SAYS, "GET OFF MY PHONE," AND THEN COMES BACK AND STABS ME THIS WAY, RIGHT HERE. AAH! UNH! I GO, "OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD." I'M LIKE, "YOU GOT TO CALL 911." SHE'S JUST LIKE, "'F' YOU. DIE. I HOPE YOU DIE. 'F' YOU. 'F' YOU. DIE." I NEED TO GET TO A HOSPITAL! I HOPE YOU DIE. I NEED TO GET TO A HOSPITAL! SO, I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD." SO, I SEE THE KEYS TO THE TRUCK. SO NOW I GRAB THE KEYS, AND I RUN OUT THE DOOR. SCREW YOU, CHARLIE! YOU DESERVE IT! STAY AWAY FROM MY CAR. NO. HEY! HEY! HEY! PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE PASSENGER DOOR OPENS UP ON THE TRUCK, AND SHE'S COMING IN. AND I'M LIKE, MAYBE SHE'S COMING TO HELP ME, OR MAYBE SHE'S COMING TO STAB ME AGAIN. I'M REALLY NOT SURE. THEN, ACCORDING TO CHARLIE, JAMIE DOES SOMETHING UNTHINKABLE. SHE REMOVES HIS KEYS FROM THE IGNITION, RUNS BACK INTO THE HOUSE, AND LOCKS THE FRONT DOOR. NOW I'M LIKE, "WHAT THE -" LIKE, "DID SHE REALLY DO THAT?" OPEN THE DOOR. I'M BANGING ON THE DOOR, PLEADING FOR HER TO LET ME IN. GET AWAY FROM ME! AT THIS POINT, I'M STARTING TO FEEL SICK. I'M A LITTLE WHEEZY. SO, I TAKE MY SHIRT OFF TO TRY TO STOP THE BLEEDING. AND I'M BANGING ON THE DOOR, BEGGING HER, "PLEASE, PLEASE, I'M GONNA DIE OUT HERE. I'M GONNA DIE OUT HERE." AND SHE'S STANDING BEHIND THE DOOR, AND SHE'S LIKE, "'F' YOU. I HOPE YOU DIE. 'F' YOU." OPEN THE DOOR! GO TO HELL! AND THEN, WHAT FELT LIKE A LIFETIME, FOR WHATEVER REASON, SHE DECIDES TO OPEN UP THE DOOR. YOU TAKE YOUR OWN DAMN CAR. OKAY. YOU TAKE YOUR OWN DAMN CAR. AS FOR JAMIE, SHE SAYS SHE HAD A VERY GOOD REASON FOR LOCKING HER BLEEDING HUSBAND OUT OF THE HOUSE. HE CAME BACK INSIDE, AND EVERY TIME HE WOULD COME, I THOUGHT HE WAS COMING, LIKE, FOR ME. YOU THOUGHT HE WAS COMING BACK AT YOU? YES, 100%. BY NOW, CHARLIE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD. I GRAB THE KEYS TO MY TRUCK, WHICH WAS A '96 FORD RANGER MANUAL-STEERING STICK, AND I DRIVE MYSELF TO THE HOSPITAL. SOMEHOW HE MAKES IT TO THE HOSPITAL BEFORE GOING INTO SHOCK. I LOST FOUR AND A HALF PINTS OF BLOOD. OHH. YOUR BODY HOLDS SEVEN. I BASICALLY DIED. I BLED OUT. SO, YOU STAYED IN THE HOUSE? MY CHILDREN WERE IN THERE. I HAD TO. I'M NOT LEAVING MY KIDS. WAS THERE BLOOD? A LITTLE BIT. A LITTLE BIT. JUST A LITTLE. HELLO? MA'AM? A NEIGHBOR HEARS THE FIGHTING AND CALLS POLICE. WHEN OFFICERS ARRIVE, JAMIE CZERNIAWSKI IS MOPPING UP CHARLIE'S BLOOD. SHE TELLS THEM HER HUSBAND CUT HIMSELF WHILE WORKING ON HIS TRUCK. I LIED TO THEM AT FIRST. WHY? I WASN'T THINKING STRAIGHT. I DIDN'T WANT TO GET HIM IN TROUBLE. I DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY SAY I WAS PROTECTING HIM. I WAS PROTECTING MY FAMILY. THEN POLICE GET A CALL THAT A NEARBY HOSPITAL HAS JUST ADMITTED SOMEONE WITH LIFE-THREATENING STAB WOUNDS. IT'S CHARLIE. JAMIE CZERNIAWSKI IS ARRESTED FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON. WHEN QUESTIONED BY POLICE DOWN AT THE STATION, JAMIE CHANGES HER STORY. NOW SHE SAYS SHE STABBED HER HUSBAND IN SELF-DEFENSE. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AND CHARLIE AND MEDICAL RECORDS, JAMIE IS LYING. WHEN A PERSON STABS ANOTHER PERSON, EVEN IF IT'S IN SELF-DEFENSE - ESPECIALLY IF IT'S IN SELF-DEFENSE - THE FIRST THING THAT IS ON YOUR MIND IS TO CALL 911, TO GET POLICE THERE TO PROTECT YOU SO THAT THERE IS PROOF THAT YOU HAD TO USE THAT LEVEL OF FORCE IN SELF-DEFENSE. BUT ACCORDING TO CHARLIE, JAMIE WOULDN'T EVEN DRIVE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL. SHE WOULDN'T CALL 911. THIS IS NOT TYPICAL VARIABLES THAT WE WOULD SEE IN A TRUE SITUATION OF SELF-DEFENSE. CHARLIE'S LEFT WITH PERMANENT NERVE DAMAGE IN HIS ARM. I HAVE NO USE OF MY HAND ANYMORE, YOU KNOW? I HAVE NO FEELING FROM HERE UP, ALL THE WAY. IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE, UNBELIEVABLE THAT SOMEBODY COULD DO THAT TO SOMEBODY. I'LL NEVER FORGIVE HER. NEVER. CHARLIE STILL LIVES IN NEW JERSEY. HE HAS A NEW GIRLFRIEND AND HAS MOVED ON WITH HIS LIFE. NO CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE BROUGHT AGAINST JAMIE. TODAY SHE LIVES IN NEW YORK CITY. SHE HAS PUT THE PAST BEHIND HER AND NOW LEADS A HAPPY AND HEALTHY LIFE. IN THE END, THE FORMER CHEERLEADER AND BEAUTY QUEEN GOT HER TIME IN THE SPOTLIGHT, BUT PROBABLY NOT THE KIND SHE DREAMED OF. IF JAMIE AND CHARLIE MADE A BIG MISTAKE, IT WAS THAT THEY PLAYED AT MARRIAGE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE PLAY HOUSE. THEY NEVER REALLY GOT IT TOGETHER IN A DEEP, TRUSTING, LOVING RELATIONSHIP. IT WAS ALL ABOUT HOW OTHERS PERCEIVED THEM. AND THAT WAS REALLY DESTINED FOR FAILURE FROM THE FIRST DAY. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
