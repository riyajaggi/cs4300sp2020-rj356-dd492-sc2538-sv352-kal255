 I FELT THAT SAME SENSE OF DOOM. [ SCREAMS ] Narrator: NOT ALL FAIRY TALES HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS. [ WOMAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] WHEN LOVE GOES WRONG, A WOMAN CAN DO THE UNTHINKABLE. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS HISTORIC DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA, IS KNOWN FOR ITS TOBACCO ROOTS.

 WE GREW UP IN A MIDDLE-CLASS HOME. I NEVER REALLY WANTED ANYTHING GROWING UP. Narrator: STILL, CRYSTAL ISN'T VERY HAPPY. Mangum: WELL, MY SISTER GOT TREATED A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN I DID. THAT CAUSED ME TO WANT TO LEAVE HOME, BECAUSE I ALWAYS GOT THE BLAME FOR EVERYTHING. Clark: SHE NEVER SEEMED TO FIT IN, EVEN IN HER OWN HOUSE. SHE HAD A SISTER WHO WAS PRETTIER, TALLER, WHO WAS MORE ATHLETIC, WHO HAD BETTER GRADES. CRYSTAL - SHE WAS NEVER QUITE AS CLOSE TO HER MOM AS SHE WANTED TO BE. THEY ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE A DISCONNECT. Narrator: IN THE END, THAT SENSE OF REJECTION WILL TRIGGER CHRONIC BAD JUDGMENT THROUGHOUT CRYSTAL'S LIFE. DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. IT SEEMS THAT CRYSTAL GOT A LOT OF MIXED MESSAGES AS A CHILD THAT ALWAYS LEFT HER WONDERING, WANTING, AND CERTAINLY CRAVING AFFECTION. IT REALLY WOULD BECOME THE THEME FOR THE REST OF HER ADULTHOOD. Narrator: CRYSTAL IS LOOKING FOR LOVE, AND SHE'S NOT PICKY ABOUT WHERE SHE FINDS IT. ONE EARLY AUTUMN DAY, SHE MEETS STEPHEN ROGERS, WHO, AT 28, IS TWICE HER AGE. BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP HIM FROM HITTING ON HER AS SHE WALKS HOME FROM SCHOOL. OH, MAN. I GOT YOU. THE TEENAGER IS DAZZLED BY HIS SLY CHARM AND HIS BANKROLL. ALL RIGHT? LET'S GO. WITHIN DAYS, THEY ARE DATING. CLOSE YOUR EYES. DON'T PEEK. STEPHEN SHOWERS CRYSTAL WITH THE ATTENTION SHE'S BEEN LONGING FOR. NOW OPEN YOUR EYES. HE BOUGHT ME A PAGER, NICE CLOTHES. HE, AT FIRST, WAS VERY DOTING, TAKING HER PLACES AND SHOWING HER THINGS THAT SHE HADN'T SEEN. Narrator: THE OLDER MAN IS LIKE A NEW AND IMPROVED FATHER FIGURE. Mangum: I FELT LOVED. I GOT THE ATTENTION THAT I DIDN'T GET AT HOME. I FELT MATURE. HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS IN CONTROL. Narrator: BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR CRYSTAL TO REALIZE THAT, IN FACT, HER SUGAR DADDY IS HOLDING ALL THE CARDS. Mangum: I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I WAS IN THE CAR WITH HIM. I PRETENDED LIKE I WASN'T A VIRGIN, SO BY THE TIME WE'D GOTTEN TO SECOND BASE, THEN IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ME TO SAY "NO," BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY PUSHING HIMSELF ON ME, SO THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME. WAS IT CONSENSUAL OR NOT? IT WASN'T. Narrator: FROM THAT MOMENT ON, STEPHEN'S INFLUENCE OVER CRYSTAL IS COMPLETE. SHE CUTS CLASSES AND SNEAKS OUT SO SHE CAN SPEND HER NIGHTS WITH HIM. HOW DOES STEPHEN REWARD HER DEVOTION? HE LETS HER HELP HIM WITH HIS "BUSINESS." Rogers: I GOT MY BOY COMING OVER, SO TAKE CARE OF HIM, ALL RIGHT? Mangum: I WILL. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, RIGHT? YEAH. OKAY. Mangum: HE WAS A DRUG DEALER. I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY NEAT, TOO, AT 14. HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT HIS HOUSE, AND HE WOULD GO OUT AND SELL ON THE BLOCK, AND I WOULD SELL OUT OF HIS HOUSE. WHENEVER SOMEONE WOULD COME BY THE HOUSE TO PICK UP A PACKAGE, I WOULD BE THE ONE TO GET THE MONEY AND GIVE THEM THE PACKAGE. Narrator: PRETTY SOON, CRYSTAL FINDS HERSELF OFFERING MORE THAN DRUGS TO STEPHEN'S CLIENTS. Mangum: WHEN THESE GUYS WOULD COME OVER, THEY WOULD MAKE SUGGESTIONS TO ME AND OFFER ME MONEY. YOU HERE BY YOURSELF RIGHT NOW? YOU INTERESTED IN DOING SOMETHING ELSE? YEAH, I GUESS. GO HAVE FUN IN THE BACK. SO, I GUESS ME BEING YOUNG, I TOOK THE MONEY, AND I HAD SEX WITH THEM. Dr. Jordan: IN CRYSTAL'S 14-YEAR-OLD MIND, SHE DOESN'T THINK SHE'S BEING EXPLOITED EVEN THOUGH SHE TRULY IS. THAT REALITY WON'T HIT HER FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. Narrator: FOR MONTHS, CRYSTAL SERVICES STEPHEN'S CUSTOMERS IN HOPES OF PLEASING HIM UNTIL SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS - SOMETHING THAT WILL FOREVER TAINT HER RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEN. Clark: HE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS A YOUNG GIRL WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. THEN HE EMERGES AS THE DEVIL. Narrator: ONE NIGHT, CRYSTAL IS WATCHING TV WITH STEPHEN AND TWO OF HIS BUDDIES WHEN THE MEN BEGIN WHISPERING AND LEERING AT HER. [ INDISTINCT WHISPERS ] Mangum: I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE CONVERSATION. THEY WERE SPEAKING IN RIDDLES. COME ON. AND BEFORE I KNEW IT... CHECK THIS OUT. ...HE STARTED TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF. JUST TAKE IT OFF. AND HIS FRIENDS WERE WATCHING. OKAY, THEY'RE COOL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. THEY'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. TAKE THIS OFF, TOO. YEAH, RIGHT THERE. LAY DOWN. JUST LAY DOWN. THEY'RE NOT WATCHING. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] HE HAD SEX WITH ME FIRST. STOP. STOP. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE FIGHTING. STOP. JUST STOP. STOP FIGHTING. COME ON. STOP FIGHTING. AND THEN HE LET HIS FRIEND HAVE SEX WITH ME WHILE HE HELD ME DOWN. Narrator: CRYSTAL NEVER GETS OVER THE ALLEGED GANG RAPE. IT HAUNTS HER STILL TODAY. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO GET THAT INNOCENT TRUST BACK THAT I ONCE HAD. FROM THAT MOMENT ON, I NEVER LOOKED FOR LOVE IN A RELATIONSHIP. Dr. Jordan: AT THIS POINT, CRYSTAL'S SELF-ESTEEM IS ABSOLUTELY IN THE GUTTER. SHE FEELS LIKE DAMAGED GOODS, AND NOW SHE SEES MEN AS SOMETHING THAT SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL. IF SHE CONTROLS THE SEXUAL SITUATIONS FROM NOW ON, WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. THAT ONE INCIDENT WILL REALLY PERMEATE THE CHOICES SHE MAKES FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Narrator: THE ONLY WAY CRYSTAL CAN COPE IS TO TRY AND PRETEND THE WHOLE THING NEVER HAPPENED. SHE TELLS NO ONE ABOUT THE ATTACK. SOMEHOW, SHE MANAGES TO MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE. SHE FINISHES HIGH SCHOOL AND JOINS THE MILITARY. AFTER TRAINING, SHE GETS STATIONED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SHE FELT LIKE DURHAM WAS GONNA LIMIT HER. SEEING THE WORLD WOULD BE THE THING THAT SHE NEEDED TO DO. EXCUSE ME, MA'AM. Narrator: WHEN CRYSTAL MEETS 21-YEAR-OLD RYAN MAHONEY, THINGS REALLY START LOOKING UP. SHE FALLS HARD FOR THE CLEAN-CUT OFFICER. YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM, DIDN'T YOU? MM-HMM. RYAN SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET. WE HAD TWO CHILDREN. Narrator: CRYSTAL LEAVES THE MILITARY TO BE A FULL-TIME MOM, BUT WHEN RYAN GETS TRANSFERRED TO WASHINGTON STATE, CRYSTAL TEMPORARILY MOVES BACK TO DURHAM WITH THEIR KIDS. SHE GETS A JOB AT A FACTORY AND ENROLLS IN COLLEGE. Mangum: I RAN ACROSS A PSYCHOLOGY CLASS - INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY - AND I FELL IN LOVE. HER ASPIRATION WAS TO WORK WITH GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED. Narrator: FINALLY, SEVEN YEARS AFTER BREAKING UP WITH STEPHEN, CRYSTAL FEELS LIKE HER LIFE IS ON TRACK. BUT ONE DAY, SHE GETS A LETTER FROM RYAN WITH SHATTERING NEWS. HE WANTS TO MARRY SOMEONE ELSE. CRYSTAL IS CRUSHED. I THINK CRYSTAL'S LIFE HAS BEEN QUITE TRAGIC. CRYSTAL HAS HAD A LOT OF HEARTBREAKS IN HER LIFE. Narrator: WITHOUT A MAN, SHE FEELS LOST AND EMPTY. Dr. Jordan: REMEMBER, CRYSTAL HAD A MAN IN HER LIFE FROM THE TIME SHE WAS 14 YEARS OLD. SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO JUST BE ALONE. SHE ALWAYS NEEDS A MAN IN HER LIFE TO VALIDATE HER. Narrator: CRYSTAL WASTES NO TIME FILLING THE VOID. A FEW MONTHS LATER, SHE STARTS DATING HER COWORKER, MATTHEW. "I'M NOT YOUR TYPE." I THINK I AM YOUR TYPE. [ LAUGHS ] I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW. I AM. I'VE GOT MY THINGS TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT. 7:00? Mangum: HE WAS FUNNY. HE MADE ME LAUGH. IT'S EVERYTHING THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IN A MAN. HE WAS A LITTLE PATERNALISTIC, BUT I THINK SHE DEFERS TO MEN. THAT VENEER OF THE FATHER FIGURE IS WHAT SHE'S ATTACHED TO. Narrator: STILL, NO MATTER HOW KIND AND UNDERSTANDING MATTHEW APPEARS TO BE, CRYSTAL HAS A HARD TIME GETTING CLOSE. Mangum: BECAUSE I HAD THESE ISSUES OF NOT BEING ABLE TO TRUST, IT ALWAYS PUT A DAMPER ON MY RELATIONSHIPS. I WOULD GIVE PHYSICALLY, BUT INSIDE, I WAS WITHHOLDING A LOT. Narrator: SHE MIGHT HAVE A NEW BOYFRIEND, BUT THE HARD TRUTH IS THAT CRYSTAL IS A 23-YEAR-OLD STRUGGLING SINGLE MOM. Mangum: I WAS GETTING FINANCIAL AID, BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH. I HAD A FAMILY. I HAD FOOD TO PUT IN THE HOUSE AND LIGHT BILLS, WATER BILL. Narrator: SO WHEN SHE HEARS ABOUT AMATEUR NIGHT AT A LOCAL STRIP CLUB, SHE THINKS SHE MIGHT HAVE FOUND THE ANSWER TO HER PROBLEMS. Clark: CRYSTAL ALWAYS HAD THIS NOTION THAT SHE'D BE A DANCER, AND SHE WOULD TELL STORIES ABOUT DANCING IN FRONT OF THE TV WITH "SOUL TRAIN." SO, SHE WAS LIKE, "WELL, IT'S EASY MONEY. IT'S GONNA PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE, GET ME THROUGH SCHOOL." Narrator: THE NIGHT OF CRYSTAL'S AUDITION, MATTHEW GOES WITH HER FOR MORAL SUPPORT. Mangum: THE BARTENDER GAVE ME A DRINK, AND THAT KIND OF RELAXED ME A LITTLE BIT. Narrator: ONCE SHE HITS THE STAGE, THE ALCOHOL LOOSENS HER UP EVEN MORE. IT WAS NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I KIND OF GO INTO A DIFFERENT ZONE. IT CAN BE VALIDATING AND DEGRADING AT THE SAME TIME. Narrator: BUT MATTHEW DOESN'T LIKE SEEING HIS GIRLFRIEND DANCING FOR CASH. HE TAKES OFF, LEAVING CRYSTAL STRANDED. SO SHE TURNS TO A CAB DRIVER FOR A RIDE HOME. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT BECOMES A TALE OF "HE SAID, SHE SAID." I NEED A RIDE. SHE CLAIMS THE CABBY GAVE HER HIS KEYS... CAB'S IN THE GARAGE. YOU WAIT FOR ME. ...AND TOLD HER TO WAIT IN THE CAR WHILE HE FINISHED HIS DRINK. AND YOU WENT OUT, AND YOU GOT IN THE CAR. MM-HMM. BUT YOU'D HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK. YEAH. Narrator: BUT CRYSTAL DOESN'T WAIT IN THE CAB. SHE GETS BEHIND THE WHEEL. SHE'S A SMART PERSON, BUT COMMON SENSE - SOMETIMES, I THINK CRYSTAL FORGETS TO USE IT. Narrator: THE CAB DRIVER HAS A DIFFERENT STORY. HE CLAIMS CRYSTAL RIPPED OFF HIS KEYS. WHEN SHE TAKES OFF, HE CALLS THE COPS. YEAH, I'D LIKE TO REPORT A STOLEN CAB. Narrator: MEANWHILE, CRYSTAL HEADS DOWN A ONE-WAY STREET THE WRONG WAY. I DON'T THINK I WAS DRIVING TOO WELL. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: COMING UP, CRYSTAL'S JUDGMENT GOES FROM BAD TO WORSE. IT WAS $200 TO $300 IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. Narrator: CRYSTAL MANGUM HAS JUST FINISHED AUDITIONING FOR A JOB AS AN EXOTIC DANCER AT A DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA CLUB. WHEN HER JEALOUS BOYFRIEND BAILS ON HER, SHE TAKES A DRUNKEN JOYRIDE THROUGH THE CITY WITH POLICE IN HOT PURSUIT. [ SIREN WAILS ] [ ENGINE REVS ] CRYSTAL LEADS THE COPS ON A FIVE-MILE HIGH-SPEED CHASE. Mangum: THE POLICE ENDED UP CATCHING UP WITH ME, AND THEY CORNERED ME. GET OUT OF THE CAR! AND I BACKED UP AND RAN INTO THE POLICE CAR. GET OUT OF THE CAR NOW! GET OUT OF THE CAR! Narrator: THE COPS CUFF CRYSTAL AND TAKE HER INTO CUSTODY, WHERE SHE PASSES OUT COLD. ACCORDING TO POLICE REPORTS, SHE'S HAMMERED - MORE THAN TWICE OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT OF ALCOHOL. SHE'S CHARGED WITH D. W. I., ASSAULTING AN OFFICER, STEALING THE CAB, AND SPEEDING. AFTER A FEW DAYS IN JAIL, CRYSTAL IS RELEASED AND ORDERED TO GET TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE. Dr. Jordan: CRYSTAL DOESN'T THINK THINGS THROUGH VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE SHE DOES THEM. THIS EVENT IS REALLY EMBLEMATIC OF THAT IMPULSIVITY. CRYSTAL IS A LOOSE CANNON. Narrator: THE INCIDENT DOESN'T STOP CRYSTAL FROM RETURNING TO THE STRIPPER POLE. SHE GETS A JOB AT A DIFFERENT CLUB AND STARTS WORKING A FEW NIGHTS A WEEK. FOR HER, DANCING ONSTAGE IS A RUSH, AND IT PAYS WELL - SO WELL THAT HER BOYFRIEND, MATTHEW, QUITS ARGUING ABOUT IT. SO, THE STRIPPING WAS ALMOST LIBERATING. WELL, YEAH. I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PAYING BILLS ANYMORE. IF MY KIDS NEEDED SOMETHING, I COULD JUST GO GET IT. IT BECAME ADDICTIVE. WERE YOU ADDICTED TO THE EASY MONEY OR THE ATTENTION? PROBABLY BOTH. Narrator: CRYSTAL KEEPS DANCING FOR THE NEXT YEAR, AND THEN, ONE DAY, SHE GETS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN HER EASY MONEY INTO AN EVEN BIGGER PAYOFF. HEY, DARLING! LOOK AT YOU. YOU ARE GORGEOUS. ONE DAY, A RECRUITER FROM AN ESCORT AGENCY CATCHES CRYSTAL'S ACT AND MAKES HER A TEMPTING OFFER. GET OUT OF THIS MESS AND GET IN... SHE ASKED IF I WANTED TO COME WORK FOR HER. IT WAS $200 TO $300 IN LESS THAN AN HOUR, PERFORMING FOR INDIVIDUALS. GONNA LET YOU THINK ABOUT IT. Narrator: THAT'S A LOT BETTER THAN STRIPPING FOR A WAD OF CRUMPLED SINGLES. CRYSTAL NEEDS LITTLE CONVINCING TO GIVE IT A SHOT. TALK TO ME ABOUT AN ESCORT SERVICE - JUST FOR THE RECORD, BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. THEY CONFUSE THE WORDS "PROSTITUTION" AND "CALL GIRL" AND "ESCORT," BUT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE INDUSTRY, CORRECT? Mangum: AS AN ESCORT, YOU SET YOUR OWN LIMITS. I NEVER HAD INTERCOURSE WITH ANY OF MY CLIENTS, WHICH WAS ALSO AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN MATTHEW AND I. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, CRYSTAL STAYS BUSY WITH PRIVATE ENGAGEMENTS FROM THE ESCORT AGENCY. SHE FANTASIZES ABOUT WHAT HER NEW INCOME CAN DO FOR HER TWO KIDS AND HER FUTURE. I WANTED TO GET MY DOCTORATE'S DEGREE. THAT WAS MY GOAL. Narrator: ON MARCH 13, 2006, THE ESCORT AGENCY CALLS CRYSTAL ABOUT A JOB. IT'S A CALL SHE'LL REGRET TAKING FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BACHELOR PARTY, AND THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER DANCER THERE. WHEN YOU GET THERE, YOU'RE GONNA MEET THE OTHER DANCER. YOU GUYS PERFORM YOUR ROUTINE, GET YOUR MONEY, WHICH WAS $400 EACH. Narrator: AT THE END OF THE NIGHT, CRYSTAL CLAIMS THE PARTY TURNED UGLY. SHE SAYS SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER. IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING THE ALLEGED ASSAULT, THE MEDIA GETS WIND OF THE STORY AND SIDES WITH CRYSTAL. BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR, ATTORNEY MISCONDUCT, CREDIBILITY ISSUES, AND A LACK OF EVIDENCE BURIES THE CASE. ONE YEAR LATER, THE NORTH CAROLINA ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICIALLY DROPS ALL CHARGES AGAINST THE MEN. CRYSTAL IS STUNNED BY THE NEWS. Mangum: TO THIS DAY, NO ONE'S EVER TOLD ME WHY MY CHARGES WERE DISMISSED. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, MAYBE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO MOVE FORWARD, BUT THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING FROM SAYING THAT I'M A LIAR. THE MAJOR SCANDAL THAT EMERGED IN 2006 WOULD BE A REAL GAME CHANGER FOR CRYSTAL. DO YOU SEE THIS? IS SHE LYING ABOUT IT? HOW COULD THEY DO THAT? OR, IN HER MIND, DID IT HAPPEN EXACTLY THE WAY SHE SAID, BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING OF A PRODUCT OF HER PAST EXPERIENCES AND HER WARPED OR DISTORTED SENSE OF THINKING? WE MAY NEVER KNOW, BUT WHEN CRYSTAL TELLS HER VERSION OF EVENTS, IN HER MIND, SHE'S TRULY NOT LYING. Narrator: CRYSTAL'S REPUTATION IS RUINED. Mangum: THE MEDIA COVERAGE WAS AN ALL-OUT SLANDER CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME. Narrator: THE STORY SEEMS TO FOLLOW HER WHEREVER SHE GOES. HOW WERE YOU FEELING? WITHDRAWN. THAT WAS THE WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD - TO BE CALLED A LIAR. IT ADDED TO THE DISGRACE AND TO THE HUMILIATION AND THE ABUSE THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED FROM THE PAST. TO SHIELD HERSELF FROM THE MEDIA, SHE BECOMES A VIRTUAL RECLUSE. SHE PRAYED THAT ONE DAY, PEOPLE WOULD SEE HER SIDE OF IT. AND SHE JUST HATED THAT IT HAPPENED ALTOGETHER. Narrator: THE FOLLOWING YEAR, CRYSTAL DECIDES TO BREAK HER SILENCE. MY NAME IS CRYSTAL GAIL MANGUM. MANY PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO USE MY NAME AND MY PAST TO INTIMIDATE ME. Narrator: SHE TEAMS UP WITH VINCENT CLARK TO WRITE AND PUBLISH A MEMOIR ABOUT HER LIFE. SHE WANTED PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS NOT A BAD PERSON. Narrator: CRYSTAL'S BOOK IS AN ATTEMPT AT SELF-DEFENSE. SHE CLAIMS SHE'S NOT A LIAR, JUST A YOUNG WOMAN WHO MADE SOME BAD DECISIONS. AND ONCE AGAIN, SHE TRIES TO MOVE PAST THE TRAUMA. IN MAY 2008, SHE GRADUATES FROM NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY WITH A DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY. Mangum: NO, YOU'RE PARANOID! Matthew: I'M PARANOID? YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING! SO EVERYTHING I FIND OUT ABOUT YOU IS NOT TRUE? BUT A MONTH AFTER GRADUATING, SHE SABOTAGES HER RELATIONSHIP WITH MATTHEW. I CHEATED ONE TOO MANY TIMES, AND HE WAS TIRED OF IT. I'M GOOD TO YOU! AND I'M GOOD TO YOU! NO, YOU'RE NOT! YES, I AM! Dr. Jordan: WHY WOULD YOU GO WITH OTHER GUYS WHEN YOU HAD MATTHEW SO IN LOVE WITH YOU? THAT'S IT! I'M DONE! I NEVER EXPECTED A LOT FROM MATTHEW. I FELT JUSTIFIED IN HAVING OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. I THINK IT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR HER THAT HE WAS SUCH A NICE GUY. Narrator: TO SUPPORT HERSELF AND HER KIDS, CRYSTAL TAKES A SALES JOB. [ BOTH LAUGHING ] AS USUAL, SHE'S NOT ALONE FOR LONG. SHE REACHES OUT TO MILTON WALKER, AN OLD BOYFRIEND FROM HIGH SCHOOL. MILTON WAS UNDERSTANDING AND A GOOD PERSON TO TALK TO. HE MADE ME FEEL NEEDED AND SPECIAL. HE HAS A CERTAIN INNOCENCE ABOUT HIM THAT MOST GUYS DON'T. Walker: WHEN I FIRST MET CRYSTAL, I WAS MESMERIZED. I WAS TAKEN BY HER. IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. Narrator: BUT JUST LIKE BEFORE, CRYSTAL'S CHOSEN A MAN WITH CHALLENGES, AND THIS TIME, THEY'RE GIANT ONES. A FEW YEARS AGO, MILTON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. Walker: I THINK I'M FINE. THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT MOST SCHIZOPHRENICS THINK THAT THEY'RE FINE, BUT I THINK - IT NEVER AFFECTED MY LIFE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, YOU KNOW, HEARING VOICES. I THOUGHT EVERYBODY THOUGHT LIKE THAT. Mangum: HE HAD EPISODES. WHEN SOMETHING'S REALLY STRESSFUL GOING ON, HIS SCHIZOPHRENIA BECOMES A PROBLEM. IT PRESENTS ITSELF. Dr. Jordan: MANY TIMES AFTER A TRAUMATIC EVENT, PEOPLE WILL RETURN TO THAT WHICH IS COMFORTING OR FAMILIAR, SO WHEN SHE FINDS MILTON, HER LONG-LOST FRIEND FROM HIGH SCHOOL, AND HE'S ACCEPTING OF HER, NONJUDGMENTAL - HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED IN 2006. HE JUST KNOWS THAT SHE'S A LONG-LOST FRIEND, AND THEY REKINDLE THAT RELATIONSHIP. Narrator: SOON, MILTON MOVES IN WITH CRYSTAL AND HER KIDS. IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. ALTHOUGH THE TWO ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER, MILTON WANTS MORE. ...ACTING LIKE THIS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU - THAT'S WHY. Walker: I WANTED CRYSTAL ALL TO MYSELF. WE WAS GETTING OLDER, AND I WANTED TO BE MORE LIKE MY PARENTS. NO, I DON'T WANT TO CALM DOWN. Narrator: ONE DAY, MILTON IS ABOUT TO DROP CRYSTAL OFF AT WORK. YOU LOOK GOOD, BABY. THANK YOU. I'M ABOUT TO BE DONE. YOU READY? PRONE TO SUDDEN WAVES OF PARANOIA, HE THINKS CRYSTAL IS USING WORK AS A COVER FOR CHEATING. HE DECIDES TO CALL HER BOSS TO SEE IF SHE'S REALLY SCHEDULED TO WORK THAT DAY. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] IS CRYSTAL SUPPOSED TO BE AT WORK TODAY? THE PERSON ON THE OTHER LINE TOLD ME SHE WAS OFF THAT DAY, SO I THOUGHT MAYBE CRYSTAL JUST WANTED TO GET DROPPED OFF AT THE JOB AND HOOK UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE DURING HER HOURS. Narrator: COMING UP, CRYSTAL PUSHES HER LUCK. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] I MADE AN INSULT THAT HE WAS LACKING IN A CERTAIN AREA. Mangum: HOW ARE YOU? I'M SO FINE. Narrator: CRYSTAL MANGUM HAS REKINDLED A ROMANCE WITH HER HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEART, MILTON WALKER. IS CRYSTAL SUPPOSED TO BE AT WORK TODAY? Narrator: BUT AFTER SIX MONTHS TOGETHER, MILTON'S TEMPER BOILS OVER WHEN HE SUSPECTS SHE'S CHEATING. HE'S BREATHING HARD, THEN HE SITS OVER IN THE CORNER, AND I ASK HIM WHAT'S WRONG. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? WHERE YOU ABOUT TO GO? I'M ABOUT TO GO TO WORK. WHY YOU ACTING LIKE THAT? WHAT'S WRONG? WHY ARE YOU LYING? I'M NOT LYING! I CALLED YOUR JOB! THEY SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE! I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY SAID THAT, BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK TODAY! THE LADY TOLD HIM THAT I WASN'T WORKING BECAUSE I WAS AT HOME. I WAS GETTING READY FOR WORK. SO HE MISUNDERSTOOD. Narrator: MILTON'S NOT BUYING IT. YOU'RE LYING. I LET MY EMOTIONS GET THE BEST OF ME, AND I ACTUALLY PUT MY HANDS ON HER. DON'T YOU **** DO THAT. WHAT YOU DOING? GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME! I START PUSHING HER. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER DONE THAT TO HER, AND I FELT DEEPLY BAD FOR THAT. I'M GOING TO WORK! ALL - ALL - ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY, BABY. I'M SORRY. SO, ARE YOU GONNA DRIVE ME TO WORK OR WHAT? [ SCOFFS ] Narrator: THE COUPLE LETS THE ARGUMENT GO, BUT IT'S JUST A TASTE OF WHAT'S TO COME. Dr. Jordan: CRYSTAL'S BACK IN THE SAME OLD PATTERNS AGAIN, AND IT REALLY BEGS THE QUESTION - CAN CRYSTAL REALLY STOP THESE PATTERNS OR IS THIS JUST GOING TO BE THE WAY THINGS ARE FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE? Narrator: NO MATTER HOW OFTEN CRYSTAL REASSURES MILTON THAT SHE'S FAITHFUL, HE CAN'T GET PAST HIS NAGGING DOUBTS. Mangum: I TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM, LET HIM KNOW THAT I WAS THERE FOR HIM AND THAT I WOULDN'T CHEAT ON HIM. Walker: CRYSTAL! CRYSTAL! Narrator: BUT CRYSTAL'S WORDS FALL ON DEAF EARS, AND LIKE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE, SHE'S SOON FACING ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP FREE FALL. ONE DAY, WHAT STARTS AS A PETTY SPAT ERUPTS INTO SOMETHING SCARY. I'M NOT YELLING AT YOU! Mangum: THE WHOLE DAY, HE WAS COMPLAINING THAT I WASN'T HAPPY WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE SAID, "I CLEAN UP THE HOUSE, YOUR KIDS MAKE A MESS, AND YOU'RE STILL NOT HAPPY." GO AHEAD AND LEAVE! GO AHEAD AND LEAVE! I DON'T CARE. I TOLD HIM THAT IF HE DIDN'T LIKE IT, HE COULD GET OUT. Narrator: AT FIRST, MILTON CALMLY AGREES TO LEAVE. WHATEVER. WHATEVER. WHERE YOU GOING? I'M GOING. BUT APPARENTLY, IT'S NOT THE REACTION SHE'S LOOKING FOR. CRYSTAL FLIES INTO A RAGE AND STARTS INSULTING HIM. THAT'S WHY YOU GOT THAT SMALL **** WHAT?! I MADE AN INSULT THAT HE WAS LACKING IN A CERTAIN AREA, AND I PROCEEDED LIKE I WAS GONNA TAKE A PICTURE. CRYSTAL, DID YOU TELL HIM HE HAD A SMALL **** I DID. Narrator: AND SHE DOESN'T STOP THERE. I'M GONNA SHOW YOUR FRIENDS, HUH? Walker: WHEN SHE STARTED TUGGING ON MY PANTS, I PUSHED HER OUT THE WAY, AND WHEN I PUSHED HER OUT THE WAY, SHE STARTED ATTACKING ME. I GRABBED HER BY THE NECK, AND I HELD HER DOWN BY THE NECK. SHUT UP! GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME! SHE WAS LIKE, "LET ME GO. LET ME GO." I WAS LIKE, "NOT UNTIL YOU CALM DOWN." CRYSTAL, CALM DOWN. I'M CALM! I AIN'T LETTING YOU UP TILL YOU CALM DOWN. Narrator: CRYSTAL'S 9-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, EMMA, WITNESSES THE UGLY SCENE. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] TERRIFIED, SHE CALLS 911 FOR HELP AND TELLS THE OPERATOR MILTON IS ATTACKING HER MOM. SHE WAS AFRAID THAT MILTON WAS GONNA KILL ME. Narrator: EVENTUALLY, MILTON BACKS OFF. CRYSTAL RACES TO THE KITCHEN, GRABBING THE FIRST WEAPON SHE CAN FIND. YOU WANT TO ACT THE FOOL? YEAH. Walker: SHE STARTED HITTING ME WITH THE CHAIR. I'M NOT PLAYING NOW! THEN SHE STARTED JABBING ME WITH THE STEP STOOL. YOU BETTER GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! AND THEN SHE SAID, "I GOT SOMETHING BETTER." YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! Narrator: MILTON CLAIMS CRYSTAL COMES AT HIM WITH A KNIFE, AND SHE'S NOT KIDDING AROUND. GONNA GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! Walker: SHE NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS BEFORE. THIS IS SOMETHING BRAND-NEW. THIS IS LIKE CRAZY CRYSTAL. I NEVER THOUGHT CRYSTAL WOULD BE THIS CRAZY, AND I WAS LIKE, "WOW." PUT THE KNIFE DOWN! YOU ACT SCARED NOW! Walker: PUT THE KNIFE DOWN. YOU SCARED? COME HERE! I GOT YOU. Narrator: COMING UP, CRYSTAL'S RAGE IGNITES, LITERALLY. FLAMES OF FIRE START COMING OUT OF THE BATHROOM. Narrator: CRYSTAL MANGUM IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEATED ARGUMENT... GO AHEAD AND LEAVE! ...WITH HER LIVE-IN BOYFRIEND, MILTON WALKER. THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO! IT GETS PHYSICAL FAST. SHUT UP! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! GIVE ME THIS CHAIR! YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! ALL RIGHT. NOW YOU SCARED, HUH? GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! Narrator: WHEN CRYSTAL THREATENS HIM WITH A KNIFE, MILTON FLEES THE APARTMENT. I WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING. I WAS RUNNING FOR MY LIFE, ACTUALLY. Narrator: INCREDIBLY, A FEW HOURS LATER, MILTON COMES BACK HOME. Walker: I GOT BACK TO THE HOUSE, AND THERE'S COP CARS THERE. BUT BEFORE I WENT IN, I NOTICED ALL MY TIRES ON MY CAR WERE SLASHED. [ AIR HISSING ] Narrator: MILTON'S GOT A FEELING HE KNOWS HOW IT HAPPENED. INSIDE, THE DURHAM COPS ARE QUESTIONING CRYSTAL. AS SOON AS MILTON WALKS THROUGH THE DOOR, SHE LUNGES AT HIM AGAIN. WHAT?! Walker: SHE WAS LIKE, "I WANT HIM OUT OF HERE. GET HIM OUT OF MY HOUSE." AND SHE GRABBED THE KNIFE, AND SHE SAID, "I'M GONNA KILL YOU. I'M GONNA KILL YOU." DID YOU EVER THREATEN MILTON WITH A KNIFE? NO. Narrator: BUT POLICE RECORDS AND MILTON DISAGREE. CRYSTAL IS ARRESTED ON THE SPOT. WHAT IS THAT SMELL? BEFORE THEY TAKE HER AWAY, THE COPS SUDDENLY NOTICE A STRANGE ODOR. WHAT ARE Y'ALL DOING?! Walker: FLAMES OF FIRE START COMING OUT OF THE BATHROOM. I ASKED CRYSTAL, "WHAT DID YOU DO?" HIS CLOTHES WERE SET ON FIRE BY ME. BUT WHY WERE YOU SETTING HIS CLOTHES ON FIRE, CRYSTAL? I GUESS BECAUSE HE HIT ME IN FRONT OF MY CHILDREN. I WAS HURT. WHAT THE HELL? Walker: SHE KNOWS THAT'S THE ONLY THING I HAD WAS MY CAR AND MY CLOTHES, AND THAT WAS IT. Clark: EVERY RELATIONSHIP BUSTED APART. SHE'S NEVER HAD A BREAKUP. SHE'S HAD AN EXPLOSION TO END A RELATIONSHIP. TAKE ME IN?! TAKE ME IN FOR WHAT?! MAN, SHE CRAZY. SHUT UP! Dr. Jordan: IT'S UNTHINKABLE THAT CRYSTAL, WITH HER PAST HISTORY, IS NOW SETTING MILTON'S CLOTHING ON FIRE, SLASHING HIS TIRES, AND THREATENING TO KILL HIM WITH A KNIFE IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE. IT'S AS IF SHE'S NEVER LEARNED ANYTHING. IN HER MIND, SHE'S IN A PLACE WHERE SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE. Narrator: CRYSTAL IS CHARGED WITH MULTIPLE CRIMES, INCLUDING ATTEMPTED MURDER AND ARSON. THE ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGE IS DROPPED BEFORE TRIAL AFTER MILTON ADMITS TO STARTING THE FIGHT. CRYSTAL SERVES 88 DAYS IN JAIL. THEN SHE'S RELEASED ON BAIL TO AWAIT TRIAL. NO MATTER HOW CRYSTAL SEES IT, THIS EVENT IS A TURNING POINT. SHE'S GONE FROM HELPLESS VICTIM TO AGGRESSOR, AND SHE NEVER LOOKS BACK. Dr. Jordan: CRYSTAL'S THOUGHT PROCESS CLEARLY WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. THE RIDICULOUS THING ABOUT THAT HUGE BLOWUP WITH MILTON IS THAT IT STARTED OVER THE MOST TRIVIAL ARGUMENT. IT TAKES VERY LITTLE TO PUSH HER CRYSTAL BUTTON AND SEND HER INTO THAT PLACE WHERE SHE JUST CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT. Narrator: 10 MONTHS LATER, CRYSTAL'S CASE GOES TO TRIAL. A JURY FINDS HER GUILTY OF CHILD NEGLECT, INJURY TO PROPERTY, AND RESISTING ARREST BUT DEADLOCKS ON THE ARSON CHARGE. CRYSTAL IS SENTENCED TO TIME SERVED. SHE IS FREE TO GO. AFTER THE TRIAL, CRYSTAL AND HER KIDS MOVE IN TO HER FRIEND PEGGY'S HOUSE. SHE FELT SECURE THERE. SHE KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE THERE, THAT SHE COULD TALK TO ME LIKE A MOM 'CAUSE HER MOM NEVER TALKED TO HER LIKE I WOULD TALK TO HER. Narrator: ONE MORE TIME, CRYSTAL TRIES TO PUT HER PAST BEHIND HER, BUT SHE DOESN'T GET FAR. SHE DECIDES TO RETURN TO THE BUSINESS SHE KNOWS BEST - ESCORTING. Dr. Jordan: SHE HAS GREAT CAPACITY TO DO SOMETHING WITH HER LIFE, AND YET WHAT DOES SHE DO? SHE GOES BACK TO THE ESCORT BUSINESS. I WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. SHE HAD SO MANY POSSIBILITIES TO LEARN FROM HER MISTAKES, AND YET SHE GOES BACK TO THE THING THAT'S GOTTEN HER IN TROUBLE HER ENTIRE LIFE. Narrator: IT WILL BE A FATEFUL CHOICE THAT WILL STIR UP EVEN MORE TROUBLE THAN SHE CAN IMAGINE. A MONTH AFTER MOVING IN WITH HER FRIEND PEGGY, CRYSTAL MEETS REGINALD DAYE, A 48-YEAR-OLD CONSTRUCTION WORKER PEGGY HIRED TO PAINT HER HOUSE. Mangum: HE WAS VERY CONSIDERATE, VERY KIND. HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF ME. Dr. Jordan: ONCE AGAIN, IT'S A DADDY FIGURE. IT'S A MAN MUCH OLDER THAN HER. ONCE AGAIN, YOU ASK THE QUESTION, "IS THIS HER CHILDHOOD NEED TO GET BACK THAT FEELING OF COMPLETE ACCEPTANCE BY A FATHER FIGURE?" HEY, WORKING HARD. HEY, YEAH. I GOT YOU A BEER. OH, THANK YOU. Narrator: WHEN CRYSTAL FINDS OUT THAT REGINALD IS LOOKING FOR A ROOMMATE, SHE SEES AN OPPORTUNITY AND TURNS ON THE CHARM. THAT'S MY NEWEST ONE. I NEED A ROOMMATE. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY? ME, ACTUALLY. YEAH. YEAH, I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO STAY. Mangum: I WAS THE FLIRTATIOUS ONE BEFORE WE WERE ROOMMATES. I SUGGESTED THAT I MOVE IN WITH HIM, AND HE SAID, "I NEED HELP WITH THE RENT, SO WE'LL GO BY A TRIAL- AND-ERROR BASIS AND TAKE IT FROM THERE." GIVE ME A HOLLER. I WILL. Narrator: WITHIN WEEKS, CRYSTAL AND HER KIDS MOVE IN TO REGINALD'S TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, CRYSTAL AND REGINALD BECOME MORE THAN ROOMMATES. CRYSTAL IS CONVINCED SHE'S MET MR. RIGHT YET AGAIN. Mangum: WE PLANNED A FUTURE TOGETHER. WE TALKED ABOUT BUYING A HOUSE. WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING MARRIED SOMEDAY. HE COULDN'T HAVE KIDS, SO HE JOKED ABOUT MY CHILDREN BEING HIS. WE LISTENED TO MUSIC ALL THE TIME WHEN THE KIDS WERE AT SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] WE MADE LOVE ALMOST EVERY DAY, A LOT OF TIMES, OUTSIDE. [ LAUGHS ] HE WAS JUST MY BEST FRIEND. Narrator: BUT CRYSTAL'S FRIENDS HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THE BUDDING ROMANCE. Peggy: I DIDN'T LIKE IT BECAUSE HER CHILDREN WANTED HER TO BE A MOM AND DIDN'T WANT ANOTHER MAN IN THE HOUSE, AND I WANTED CRYSTAL TO START OFF WITH JUST HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN AND LET GOD DO THE REST FOR HER. CRYSTAL WANTS TO BE A GOOD MOTHER, A GOOD PERSON, BUT SHE'D JUST GET WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE, AND THEY INFLUENCE HER, AND THEN SHE FORGETS ABOUT HER PRIORITIES. I THINK CRYSTAL'S MAIN PROBLEM IN LIFE IS MEN - THE WRONG TYPE OF MEN. Narrator: TURNS OUT HER FRIEND'S INSTINCTS ARE RIGHT ON TARGET. LIKE CLOCKWORK, THE SAME OLD PROBLEMS START TO SURFACE. WHERE YOU GOING? I HAVE TO WORK TONIGHT. TO WORK? TO WORK. I'M ABOUT TIRED OF THIS JOB. YOU NEED TO STAY HOME TONIGHT. REGINALD ISN'T HAPPY ABOUT CRYSTAL WORKING AS AN ESCORT. YOU NEED TO STAY HOME. HE STARTED KEEPING MY CELLPHONE. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] HE WOULD ANSWER MY PHONE AND ASK THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END THEIR NAME, HOW THEY KNOW ME. WHO IS THIS? HOW YOU KNOW CRYSTAL? NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK THERE'S GONNA BE ANY OF THAT TONIGHT. WHO WAS THAT? YOU TELL ME WHO THAT WAS. I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T ANSWER IT. WHO IS THAT CALLING?! WHO IS THAT? SOME SPECIAL DUDE? Mangum: IT'S KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN INNOCENT JEALOUSY AND CONTROLLING JEALOUSY. I'M NOT JEALOUS! I DON'T LIKE EVERYBODY CALLING YOUR PHONE! IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE BOYFRIENDS EVENTUALLY RESENT THE WORK THAT SHE DOES AS AN ESCORT. THEY WANT HER TO BE EXCLUSIVE TO THEM, AND CRYSTAL WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED IN THAT WAY. SIT DOWN AND SHUT THE HELL UP. DON'T ANSWER MY PHONE. YEAH, YOU GONNA STAY HERE TONIGHT. THAT'S ALL I KNOW. YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE! CRYSTAL, I SAID YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE. SORRY. THAT WAS, UM, MY FRIEND. YOU BETTER NOT LEAVE! YEAH, I'M WEARING SOMETHING NICE. OKAY. BYE. Narrator: COMING UP... I'M TRYING TO HIDE FROM HIM, AND HE'S THROWING THESE KNIVES. I BET YOU WANT TO STOP NOW! STOP! WHAT ABOUT THIS, HUH? Narrator: WHEN 32-YEAR-OLD CRYSTAL MANGUM MEETS REGINALD DAYE, SHE THINKS SHE'S FINALLY FOUND HER SOUL MATE. WHO IS THAT CALLING?! WHO IS THAT? SOME SPECIAL DUDE? BUT SHE'S WRONG. APRIL 2, 2011, CRYSTAL AND REGINALD ARRIVE HOME AFTER A NIGHT OF DRINKING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY YOU ALWAYS GOT TO ACT LIKE THAT? WHY DO YOU GOT TO WEAR THAT STUFF? AFTER REGINALD ACCUSES HER OF FLIRTING WITH OTHER MEN, ALL BETS ARE OFF. WHAT'S WRONG? YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY - YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PROBLEM. CAN I SAY SOMETHING? YOU ALWAYS YELLING FOR NO REASON. YOU KEEP TALKING TO ME ABOUT NOTHING! WHY YOU ACTING LIKE THIS? I'M TIRED OF YOU. STOP DOING THIS. I CANNOT TAKE THIS! HE GRABS ME... YOU AND YOUR KIDS! DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! ...STARTS SPITTING IN MY FACE. DO YOU HEAR ME? I'M TIRED OF YOU ACTING LIKE A SLUT! "BITCH, I TOLD YOU NOT TO CROSS ME. I OPENED UP MY HOUSE TO YOU, AND THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT ME?" [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] HE FLEW OFF INTO A RAGE. GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! Narrator: CRYSTAL SAYS SHE ESCAPES TO THE BEDROOM BUT REGINALD COMES AFTER HER. Mangum: I SAT ON THE BED, AND HE PUSHED ME DOWN AND PUT HIS HAND OVER MY FACE SO I COULDN'T BREATHE. I'M TIRED OF YOUR MOUTH! JUST LEAVE! YOU NEED TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH! YOU TALK TOO MUCH! I TRIED TO PUSH HIM AWAY. WON'T YOU JUST BE QUIET? I'M TIRED OF YOUR MOUTH! I GRABBED HIS WRIST. SHUT YOUR MOUTH! SHUT YOUR MOUTH! I SAID, "STOP!" AND YOU WON'T DO THIS? I KEPT SCREAMING, "NO," BUT HE WOULDN'T STOP. THEN HE PULLED ME OFF OF THE BED AND STARTS HITTING ME IN MY FACE, SLAPPING ME, PULLING MY HAIR OUT. I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. Narrator: ACCORDING TO CRYSTAL, REGINALD SUDDENLY PULLS BACK AND HEADS FOR THE KITCHEN. SEE THESE? SHE CLAIMS WHEN HE RETURNS, HE'S ARMED. YOU WANT TO PLAY NOW?! I BET YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY NOW! I'M TRYING TO HIDE FROM HIM, AND HE'S THROWING THESE KNIVES. I BET YOU WANT TO STOP NOW! STOP! WHAT ABOUT THIS, HUH? I'VE GOT THIS FOR YOU! YOU WANT TO TALK NOW? JUST LEAVE! [ SCREAMS ] NOW YOU WANT TO TALK? STOP! HUH? LET'S TALK! JUST LEAVE! GO! YOU WANT TO KEEP TALKING? NO. Narrator: SHE SAYS SHE DODGES THE FLYING BLADES, BUT REGINALD IS JUST GETTING STARTED. NO. Mangum: HE COMES OVER TO ME. WHERE YOU GOING NOW, HUH? YOU WANT THOSE OTHER DUDES, YOU CAN HAVE THEM. I DON'T EVEN WANT YOU! THOSE OTHER DUDES CAN HAVE YOU NOW! HE STARTS CHOKING ME WHERE I CAN'T BREATHE. THE MORE I TRY TO PULL HIS HAND AWAY FROM ME, THE TIGHTER HE GETS, AND HE'S CONSTANTLY SAYING... I WAS GOOD TO YOU AND YOUR KIDS! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? TALK NOW! TALK NOW! NOW SAY IT! I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. HUH? NOW WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY, GIRL? I FELT THAT REGINALD WAS GONNA KILL ME. I FELT THAT SAME SENSE OF DOOM AS SOMETHING BEYOND MY CONTROL AGAIN. TALK TO ME! WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY NOW, HUH? NOW WHAT?! WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY?! TELL ME WHY! Narrator: CRYSTAL GRABS A KNIFE. WHY DID YOU DO ME LIKE THAT, HUH? I WAS GOOD TO YOU! I WAS - [ SCREAMS ] I PLUNGED THE KNIFE INTO HIS SIDE. [ GROANS ] HE GOT OFF OF ME. [ SCREAMING ] THE VIOLENT FIGHT THAT SHE HAS WITH REGINALD BECOMES A CULMINATION OF EVERY OTHER ABUSIVE EVENT IN HER LIFE, STEMMING ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHERE SHE WAS 14. IT'S AS IF EVERY FIGHT, EVERY ENCOUNTER WHERE A MAN HAS THREATENED HER, SEXUALLY AGGRESSED AGAINST HER, DISBELIEVED HER, ACCUSED HER OF CHEATING, IT ALL COMES TOGETHER IN THIS HUGE TORNADO. IT'S ALMOST AS IF EVERYTHING WAS A STEPPING STONE TO THIS ONE HUGE EVENT. I WAS GOOD TO YOU! I WAS - [ SCREAMING ] [ GROANS ] [ GROANS ] Mangum: I WAS AFRAID. I WAS REALLY NOT THINKING THAT IT WAS GONNA HURT HIM. I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET HIM OFF OF ME. Narrator: CRYSTAL SAYS SHE THEN RUNS TO HER AUNT'S HOUSE SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY AND CALLS POLICE. MEANWHILE, REGINALD STAGGERS UPSTAIRS TO HIS NEPHEW'S APARTMENT TO GET HELP. [ PANTING ] REGGIE! OH, MY GOD. [ CELLPHONE BEEPING ] [ SIREN WAILS ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Narrator: WHEN POLICE ARRIVE AT HER AUNT'S HOUSE, CRYSTAL IS STUNNED WHEN THEY HAVE A PAIR OF CUFFS FOR HER INSTEAD OF REGINALD. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. HE'S ALREADY REPORTED HIS VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED. TELL THEM, AUNTIE! HE TRIED TO KILL ME! HE CLAIMS THAT CRYSTAL STABBED HIM, STOLE HIS MONEY, AND RAN AWAY. Mangum: THEY CAME OVER AND HANDCUFFED ME AND SAID, "GET UP, CRYSTAL. LET'S GO." THAT WAS IT. DID YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT REGINALD HAD DONE TO YOU? I TOLD THEM THAT MY FACE WAS BRUISED. MY FACE WAS BLEEDING FROM WHERE HE HAD PUNCHED ME. MY SKIN WAS OPEN. I HAD SEVERAL KNOTS ON MY SCALP FROM WHERE HE HAD PULLED MY HAIR OUT. HONESTLY, I THINK THEY WERE JUST HAPPY THAT THEY WERE ARRESTING ME. Narrator: ALMOST TWO WEEKS AFTER THE STABBING, REGINALD DIES FROM COMPLICATIONS. I CRIED FOR DAYS. I WAS CONFUSED. "HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?" I COULDN'T IMAGINE HIM BEING THERE ONE DAY AND THEN GONE. Narrator: NOW PROSECUTORS CHARGE CRYSTAL WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. Mangum: I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT BECAUSE I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET HIM OFF OF ME. AT THE TIME, I WAS AFRAID. I DIDN'T INTEND TO HURT REGINALD. [ SCREAMS ] I DIDN'T INTEND TO KILL HIM. I NEVER WOULD EVEN CONCEIVE OF HURTING ANYONE, LET ALONE THE PERSON THAT I LOVED AND LIVED WITH. Narrator: TODAY, CRYSTAL IS AT THE DURHAM COUNTY JAIL, AWAITING TRIAL FOR MURDER. SHE CLAIMS HER BIGGEST FEAR IS THAT SHE'LL NEVER ESCAPE HER PAST. I TRY TO MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE AND IGNORE ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT ME AND MY CHARACTER, BUT I KEEP HITTING THAT SAME WALL, AND I GOT TO TEAR IT DOWN. THE OUTCOME OF THIS INCIDENT WITH REGINALD IS REALLY GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER CRYSTAL IS GOING TO BE A VICTIM OF HER PAST OR WHETHER OR NOT SHE CAN LEARN FROM HER MISTAKES, AND I THINK IT'S A CONSTANT REMINDER TO US, WATCHING FROM THE OUTSIDE, THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE.
