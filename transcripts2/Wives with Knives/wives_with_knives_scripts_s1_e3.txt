 DON'T YOU DARE TURN YOUR BACK ON ME." Man: AAH! Narrator: NOT ALL FAIRY TALES HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS. [ WOMAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] WHEN LOVE GOES WRONG, A WOMAN CAN DO THE UNTHINKABLE. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS AUGUST 1997, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON. 43-YEAR-OLD NANCY OTT SEEMS TO HAVE IT ALL - A SUCCESSFUL NURSING CAREER, THREE GROWN CHILDREN, AND A HANDSOME HUSBAND NAMED AARON DAVIS. BUT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, NANCY AND AARON'S THREE-YEAR MARRIAGE IS SLOWLY FALLING APART. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE GOING TO SOME INTERVIEWS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

 YOU KNOW, HONEY, I WOKE UP A LITTLE BIT LATE. NANCY CLAIMS AARON CAN'T HOLD DOWN A JOB AND THE STRESS OF HER SUPPORTING THE FAMILY ON HER NURSING INCOME IS DRIVING A GIANT WEDGE BETWEEN THEM. THIS IS GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY. I HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THESE TWO JOBS. THE MARRIAGE, NANCY'S THIRD, APPEARS TO BE HEADED FOR DISASTER. THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, TOMORROW - I THINK THEY'RE GONNA HIRE ME. [ BOTH SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] IT'S YET ANOTHER FAILURE THAT NANCY SAYS STEMS FROM A TRAUMATIC CHILDHOOD. YOU'RE WORTHLESS. WORTHLESS? YOU MEAN NOTHING HERE. OH, COME ON. I TAKE CARE OF... ACCORDING TO NANCY, SHE CAUSED THE BREAKUP OF HER MOTHER'S MARRIAGE. DON'T YOU EVEN... I AM THE DAUGHTER OF THE MILKMAN - LITERALLY. MY MOM HAD AN AFFAIR WITH THE MILKMAN, AND THAT'S ME. SHE HATED ME. SHE SAID IF THERE WERE ABORTION IN HER DAYS, I WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE. Narrator: WHEN THE MILKMAN TAKES OFF, NANCY'S MOTHER TRAINS ALL HER ANGER AND FRUSTRATION ON HER DAUGHTER. I AM SO MAD AT YOU, NANCY! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT! YOU'RE THE REASON YOU'RE IN HERE. Nancy: I WAS TIED TO A CHAIR EVERY SINGLE DAY FROM THE AGE OF 3. I WAS ALLOWED OUT FOR LUNCH. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO HIT YOU. HER MOM WAS NOT A VERY NICE PERSON. SHE USED TO LOCK HER IN CLOSETS - THINGS THAT CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO. YOU ARE A BAD GIRL. LOOKING RIGHT IN MY EYES AND TELLING ME, "I HATE YOU." BAG GIRL! Narrator: BUT HER MOTHER'S RAGE PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE ABUSE NANCY CLAIMS SHE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF A TRUSTED FAMILY FRIEND. Nancy: HE WOULD TAKE ME OUT TO THE APPLE ORCHARDS AND, UM, MAKE ME HAVE ORAL SEX WITH HIM. Narrator: DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. NANCY'S TRAUMATIC CHILDHOOD MAKES HER FEEL CHRONICALLY SUBMISSIVE AND VULNERABLE, ALWAYS UNDESERVING OF LOVE, AND THIS IS A PATTERN THAT WILL HAUNT HER THROUGHOUT THE REST OF HER RELATIONSHIPS. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Narrator: THE DAY SHE TURNS 18, NANCY'S MOTHER KICKS HER OUT. WITH NOWHERE TO TURN, SHE MARRIES HER TEENAGE BOYFRIEND, JAMES MILLER, BUT THEIR MARRIAGE IS DOOMED FROM THE START. YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL. NANCY FINDS INTIMACY NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. Nancy: WELL, I HAD A REALLY, REALLY HARD TIME ACCEPTING ANY TYPE OF TOUCH. IT WOULD MAKE ME STIFFEN UP, AND IT WAS HARD. I DON'T SAY IT WAS A LOVING RELATIONSHIP AT ALL. NANCY. I JUST - I JUST CAN'T. IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN REALLY TRUST ME. IT'S, UH... Narrator: DESPITE NANCY'S TROUBLE GETTING CLOSE, SHE AND JAMES HAVE A CHILD, RACHEL, BUT THEY DIVORCE WHEN SHE'S A TODDLER. NANCY'S PROBLEMS FOLLOW HER WHEN SHE MARRIES HER SECOND HUSBAND, LES OTT. THEY HAVE A SON NAMED SAM, BUT SOON AFTER HE'S BORN, THE COUPLE SPLITS UP. Samuel: I THINK SHE WENT THROUGH LIFE SO LONG WITH HER EMOTIONS LOCKED UP FROM HER CHILDHOOD THAT I DON'T THINK SHE KNEW HOW TO BE HAPPY. Narrator: NOW MARRIAGE NUMBER THREE, TO AARON, IS ON A SIMILAR COLLISION COURSE. HE REALLY CONNED MY MOM OUT OF A LOT OF WHAT SHE EARNED, AND HE WOULD JUST PUT HER DOWN. HE DIDN'T MAKE HER FEEL WORTHWHILE. Nancy: MY LOT IN LIFE WAS TO BE ABUSED AND TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BECAUSE I DESERVED IT, BECAUSE I WAS BORN. Dr. Jordan: NANCY NOT ONLY SAYS THAT HER MOTHER ABUSED HER, BUT SHE CLAIMS THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY ONE OF HER HUSBANDS WERE ABUSIVE IN SOME RESPECT, AND ONE HAS TO ASK, "IS ABUSE SIMPLY A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE? "DOES SHE SEE EVERYTHING THROUGH THE FILTER OF HER MOTHER'S LEGACY?" [ SCHOOL BELL RINGS ] ALL RIGHT, LET ME JUST GIVE YOU THIS PASS, AND YOU CAN GET BACK TO CLASS. Narrator: WITH HER THIRD MARRIAGE ON THE ROCKS, NANCY FEARS SHE'LL NEVER MEET THE MAN OF HER DREAMS, BUT WHEN SHE LANDS A NURSING AND TEACHING GIG AT A SEATTLE ARTS SCHOOL, HER LUCK STARTS TO CHANGE. OH [CHUCKLES] I'M NANCY. NANCY, REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. I'M THE PRINCIPAL. OH, OH, GOODNESS... SHE CATCHES THE EYE OF HER NEW BOSS, THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, MICHAEL ANDERSON. MICHAEL IS CHARMING, CULTURED, AND SUCCESSFUL, A SHARP CONTRAST TO NANCY'S CURRENT HUSBAND, AARON. ALTHOUGH NANCY AND MICHAEL ARE INSTANTLY ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER, THEY'RE BOTH MARRIED, SO THEY KEEP THEIR RELATIONSHIP PLATONIC. Nancy: I LIKED HIM. HE WAS A GOOD-LOOKING MAN, HE WAS FUN TO BE WITH, AND I ENJOYED HIS COMPANY. Dr. Jordan: YOU WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT "THIS IS RIGHT, AND THIS IS WRONG, AND YOU DON'T GET INVOLVED WITH SOMEBODY YOU WORK WITH." I HAD STRONG VALUES. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO GET CLOSE TO SOMEBODY YOU'RE WORKING WITH. YOU'RE VERY GOOD WITH BOUNDARIES. YEAH. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT NANCY THAT MAKES YOU WONDER IF HER PRESENTATION IS SLIGHTLY A FACADE. SHE'S EXTREMELY PRIM AND PROPER, ALMOST NUN-LIKE, BUT THERE'S THIS UNDERPINNING OF DISHONESTY ABOUT IT. [ CELLPHONE RINGS, BEEPS ] Narrator: TWO YEARS LATER, THINGS HAVE CHANGED. NANCY'S SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND, AARON, AND MICHAEL'S MOVED ON TO A NEW JOB AT A DIFFERENT SCHOOL, BUT HE HASN'T FORGOTTEN NANCY. OH, YEAH, YOU CAN COOK? HE TOLD ME HOW MUCH HE REALLY DID LIKE ME AND WANTED TO TAKE THE RELATIONSHIP A LITTLE FURTHER THAN FRIENDSHIP. I ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS WIFE, AND HE SAID THAT HE AND HIS WIFE WERE SEPARATED, THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON A DIVORCE. Narrator: TO NANCY, MICHAEL SEEMS LIKE A CATCH, AND SHE ENJOYS HIS WINING AND DINING. WHEN SHE MET HIM, SHE KIND OF THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA BE HER KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR AND KIND OF SAVE HER AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. [ MICHAEL LAUGHS ] Narrator: MICHAEL'S SOCIAL STATUS ALSO SCORES POINTS WITH NANCY. HE'S BIG IN THE LOCAL ARTS SCENE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE, NANCY GETS TO MINGLE WITH THE IN-CROWD. Nancy: I WANTED TO BREAK OUT OF MYSELF AND EXPERIENCE LIFE AND SOCIALIZE. AND HOW DID HE MAKE YOU FEEL? BEAUTIFUL - ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. IT WAS SO OPPOSITE OF ANYTHING THAT I EVER EXPERIENCED. I SAW A BIG CHANGE IN MY MOM WHEN THEY STARTED DATING. BEFORE, SHE WOULD JUST KIND OF STAY AT HOME. SHE WAS A LITTLE SOCIAL BUTTERFLY AFTER THEY STARTED DATING, AND IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE. Narrator: NANCY HOPES MICHAEL CAN END HER STREAK OF FAILED RELATIONSHIPS. Dr. Jordan: NANCY MOVES FORWARD, BELIEVING THAT THE NEXT ONE WILL BE DIFFERENT AND SHE WILL FIND TRUE LOVE. WITH MICHAEL, HE WAS A DEFINITE STEP UP COMPARED TO ALL THE OTHER MEN SHE HAD BEEN WITH. [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] SO, WHAT'D YOU THINK? THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME COOKING SALMON. Narrator: BUT ON NANCY'S FIRST VISIT TO MICHAEL'S HOUSE, HER HOPES OF HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER ARE QUICKLY DASHED. THAT PURSE THAT'S HANGING THERE... [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, THAT'S MY WIFE'S, UH, PURSE. SHE'S LIVING HERE? I WANTED TO KNOW WHY HIS WIFE'S THINGS WERE STILL THERE AND COME TO FIND OUT THAT SHE REALLY IS ONLY VISITING HER MOTHER. WELL, HE STARTED TO BACKPEDAL AND STUMBLE OVER HIS WORDS. "OH, WELL, I - SHE - SHE WAS GETTING AN APARTMENT, "AND SHE'S NOT QUITE MOVED OUT YET, BUT SHE'S ON HER WAY AND..." OH, YEAH, I DIDN'T LIKE THAT. BUT WHAT DID YOU DO ABOUT IT? I TOLD HIM I COULDN'T SEE HIM ANYMORE. I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU. ALL RIGHT, I'M DONE. I'M DONE. Narrator: NANCY IS BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED. PLEASE, COME BACK. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] A FEW WEEKS LATER, MICHAEL CALLS TO TELL HER THAT HIS WIFE HAS FINALLY MOVED OUT. HELLO. NANCY. LET ME EXPLAIN. YOU'RE THE WOMAN I WANT TO BE WITH. HE CONVINCES HER TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. OKAY, SO, WHAT'S NEXT? THE COUPLE PICKS UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF. SOON, NANCY FEELS SECURE ENOUGH TO INTRODUCE MICHAEL TO HER KIDS, RACHEL AND SAM. THEY WELCOME HIM TO THE FAMILY. Sausser: I THOUGHT HE WAS A VERY NICE GUY. HE WAS VERY ATTENTIVE TO MY MOM - SOMEONE YOU COULD ASPIRE TO, SOMEONE, IF HE WERE YOUR TEACHER, YOU WOULD LOOK UP TO HIM. NICE MEETING YOU! TO THE FUTURE. Narrator: BUT AS THEIR RELATIONSHIP HITS THE FOUR-MONTH MARK, NANCY'S THROWN ANOTHER CURVEBALL. ARE YOU NANCY? YES. ARE YOU WITH MICHAEL? ONE AFTERNOON, SHE'S ABOUT TO HEAD HOME AFTER WORK WHEN SHE CLAIMS SHE'S APPROACHED BY A COWORKER WHO DELIVERS AN OMINOUS WARNING. YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW HE'S NOT WHAT HE SEEMS. TRUST ME. Nancy: A FRIEND OF HIS EX-WIFE CAME TO ME AND SAID, "YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW HIM. HE'S NOT WHO YOU THINK HE IS." Narrator: THE CRYPTIC MESSAGE SHAKES NANCY TO THE CORE. WHAT DARK SECRETS COULD MICHAEL POSSIBLY BE HIDING? MICHAEL PUTS NANCY ON A SHORT LEASH. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] HE WAS VERY POSSESSIVE OF WHERE SHE WAS ALL THE TIME. Narrator: 43-YEAR-OLD NANCY OTT HAS BEEN DATING MICHAEL ANDERSON FOR FOUR MONTHS. SHE THINKS HE'S THE MAN OF HER DREAMS... [ Chuckling ] YES, YES. ...UNTIL A FRIEND OF MICHAEL'S EX-WIFE APPEARS WITH A BIZARRE MESSAGE. TRUST ME. YOU DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL. SHE SAYS MICHAEL IS NOT WHO HE SEEMS TO BE, BUT NANCY CHOOSES NOT TO HEED THE WARNING. Nancy: FOR ME, I JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS PROTECTING HER FRIEND, SO I DIDN'T REALLY TAKE IT AS MUCH AS A WARNING AS HER JUST TRYING TO... MEDDLE IN YOUR ROMANCE. YES. WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOGETHER THAT LONG... Narrator: AND WHEN MICHAEL OPENS UP ABOUT HIS FEELINGS FOR HER, ANY LAST DOUBTS COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR. I JUST FEEL GOOD WHEN I'M AROUND YOU. Nancy: AND HE TOLD ME HE WAS GETTING SERIOUS, AND HE TOLD ME - HE GOES, "I THINK I'M FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU." Dr. Jordan: HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? WONDERFUL - I REALLY DID. SUCH A MAN OF THE WORLD THAT LOVES SOMEONE THAT'S JUST A LITTLE SPECK OUT THERE. THAT'S WHEN I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, "YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHO I REALLY AM." GOT SOME STUFF GOING ON IN MY PAST THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. Narrator: NANCY TELLS MICHAEL ABOUT ALL THE ABUSE SHE SUFFERED AS A CHILD. I JUST REALLY NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT I CAN'T BE HURT AGAIN. Nancy: I WANTED TO TELL HIM BECAUSE IT IMPACTS MY INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN. SHE WAS VERY VULNERABLE, AND SHE SAID TO HIM, YOU KNOW, LOOKING HIM IN THE EYES, "PLEASE DON'T HURT ME." SHE KNEW SHE REALLY COULDN'T TAKE IT, AND HE SAID, "I WILL NOT HURT YOU." Narrator: NINE MONTHS INTO THEIR RELATIONSHIP, MICHAEL PROPOSES. THE COUPLE WASTES NO TIME TYING THE KNOT. IT'S NANCY'S FOURTH MARRIAGE AND MICHAEL'S THIRD. SHE REALLY BELIEVED HE WAS DIFFERENT. SHE THOUGHT THIS GUY WAS THE ONE, AND SHE WAS ALWAYS HOPING TO FIND THAT PRINCE CHARMING. Nancy: WE GOT MARRIED IN LAS VEGAS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I WANTED TO GET MARRIED. IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A ROMANTIC PLACE. IT WAS MAGICAL. IT WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED IT TO BE. HE WAS A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR. I WAS SWEPT OFF MY FEET. Narrator: NANCY THINKS SHE'S HIT THE JACKPOT. THE NEWLYWEDS TAKE AN EXPENSIVE CRUISE TO ALASKA AND THEN MOVE IN TO AN UPSCALE HOME IN THE SUBURBS OF SEATTLE. NANCY IS FINALLY LIVING THE GOOD LIFE SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED. WHOO. [ LAUGHS ] FROM AN OUTSIDER'S VIEW, THEY PROBABLY SEEMED TO BE A PERFECT COUPLE WITH A PERFECT LIFE. Narrator: BEING MARRIED TO MICHAEL MAKES NANCY FEEL LIKE A WHOLE NEW WOMAN. Nancy: I CARED MORE ABOUT MYSELF. I CARED WHAT I LOOKED LIKE. I CARED HOW I CARRIED MYSELF. IS THAT THE NEW NANCY OR WAS THAT NANCY ALWAYS THERE, BUT SHE WAS SUPPRESSED BY THE LEGACY OF ABUSE? I THINK I WAS ALWAYS THERE. I WAS JUST NOT ALLOWED OUT. SO MICHAEL REVEALED THE REAL NANCY. YEAH. I COULD BE WHO I WAS AND STILL BE LOVED. IT WAS LIBERATING. Narrator: STILL, IT'S LIKE NANCY IS CURSED. BEFORE LONG, JUST LIKE ALL HER PREVIOUS MARRIAGES, THE HONEYMOON ENDS TOO SOON. THAT'S MY PAYCHECK. YOU OPENED IT. YEAH. SHE SAYS A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE WEDDING, MICHAEL STARTS SHOWING A DARK SIDE. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME CASH? UM... Nancy: HE WAS VERY CONTROLLING. MY MONEY WENT INTO HIS ACCOUNT. HE CONTROLLED ALL THE MONEY AND GAVE ME AN ALLOWANCE. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH ALL OF YOUR - ALL YOUR MONEY? JUST GONNA SEE SOME FRIENDS. FRIENDS? Narrator: BUT NANCY'S DAUGHTER, RACHEL, DISAGREES. AND IF HE WAS CONTROLLING OVER HER MONEY, IT WAS SERIOUSLY NOT APPARENT. I NEVER ONCE GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS PUT ON A BUDGET IN ANY WAY OR HAD NO MONEY. Narrator: IN FACT, RACHEL REMEMBERS MICHAEL SPOILING NANCY AND SHOWERING HER WITH EVERY POSSIBLE LUXURY. Sausser: HE HAD A REALLY GOOD JOB, AND SHE HAD THE BIGGER HOUSE THAT SHE WANTED, A NICE CAR. MY MOM NEVER LACKED FOR ANYTHING. MY MOM HAD MANY, MANY, MANY CREDIT CARDS. MY MOM HAD NO PROBLEMS GOING OUT SHOPPING. SHE WAS VERY MUCH INTO A LIFESTYLE THAT AFFORDED HER TO LOOK NICE, AND I THINK THAT MICHAEL PROVIDED THAT FOR HER. Narrator: BUT NANCY INSISTS THAT MICHAEL'S CONTROLLING NATURE GETS OVERBEARING FAST, [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] AND HE'S ALSO GOT A NASTY JEALOUS STREAK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. [ CHUCKLES ] TELL ME. IT'S JUST - IT'S FINE. REALLY? YEAH. HE WAS VERY POSSESSIVE OF WHERE SHE WAS ALL THE TIME. HER AND I WENT OUT FOR DRINKS AFTER WORK ONE NIGHT... CAN YOU EVER RELAX WHEN YOU GO OUT? [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] OKAY, YOUR WHOLE FACE HAS CHANGED. WAS THAT MICHAEL? WE WERE THERE MAYBE AN HOUR. HE CALLED FIVE OR SIX TIMES, ASKING WHERE SHE WAS, WHO SHE WAS WITH, WHAT SHE WAS DOING. HE'S UPSET THAT I'M OUT. I JUST... YOU SEEMED TO KEEP MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES, GETTING INVOLVED WITH CONTROLLING MEN, OVER AND OVER AGAIN. CONTROL IS A FORM OF LOVE. IT HAD TO BE. IT CAME FROM MY MOTHER. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE YOUR MOTHER LOVES YOU NO MATTER WHAT SHE SAYS AND CONTROL IS HOW IT'S SHOWN. THE PATTERN THAT NANCY EXHIBITS IS ALWAYS ONE OF SEARCHING FOR LOVE, SEARCHING FOR A MAN TO COMPLETE HER. REALLY, IT'S NOT SO MUCH OF HER TURNING TO A PATTERN OF ABUSE AS TRYING TO FILL THAT HOLE IN HER HEART FROM HER CHILDHOOD, WHICH, CLEARLY, NO MAN IS EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO FILL. AND SO HER RELATIONSHIP WITH MICHAEL IS DOOMED FROM THE START. Narrator: THOUGH SHE BRISTLES AT WHAT SHE CONSIDERS MICHAEL'S POSSESSIVENESS, NANCY IS DETERMINED TO MAKE THIS MARRIAGE WORK. [ CHUCKLES ] [ DOORBELL RINGS ] THAT IS, UNTIL AN UNEXPECTED KNOCK AT THE DOOR IS LIKE GAS ON A SMOLDERING FLAME. I WANTED TO SEE THE WOMAN WHO REPLACED ME. Narrator: AT FIRST, NEWLYWEDS NANCY AND MICHAEL ANDERSON SEEM TO BE LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER IN SUBURBAN SEATTLE, BUT IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE THIS MARRIAGE, NANCY'S FOURTH, STARTS TO FALTER. THE LATEST TROUBLING DEVELOPMENT - A SURPRISE VISITOR AT THE DOOR. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? Jennifer: I'M HERE TO PICK UP SOME THINGS. ACCORDING TO NANCY, MICHAEL'S EX-WIFE JENNIFER SHOWS UP ON THEIR DOORSTEP TO RETRIEVE SOME OF HER BELONGINGS THAT MICHAEL STILL HAS STASHED AWAY. MICHAEL DIDN'T TELL YOU. WHAT AN ASS. NO. THERE ARE SOME THINGS I SHOULD TELL YOU. NANCY RELUCTANTLY LETS JENNIFER IN. WHEN WE STARTED DATING, I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS EVEN MARRIED. SHE DID WARN MY MOM TO STAY AWAY FROM MICHAEL AND THAT MICHAEL WASN'T A GOOD GUY. Narrator: AND THAT'S NOT ALL. JENNIFER TELLS NANCY A SHOCKING SECRET ABOUT MICHAEL'S PAST. I FOUND HIM CHEATING ON ME. I WENT TO HIS SCHOOL... Nancy: WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ONE OF HER CHILDREN, HE WORKED AT A UNIVERSITY AND HAD A TWO-YEAR AFFAIR. TWO YEARS, AND SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A STUDENT. THAT'S HOW MICHAEL IS, AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW BECAUSE IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. Narrator: THE REVELATION MAKES NANCY EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE MAN SHE MARRIED. WHEN HE GETS HOME FROM WORK THAT NIGHT, SHE CONFRONTS HIM. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY? JENNIFER SHOWED UP AT THE DOOR. MY EX-WIFE? YEAH, YOUR EX-WIFE, WITH A STORY ABOUT SOME AFFAIR FROM THE PAST WITH A STUDENT. OH, COME ON, NANCY - WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THAT? Nancy: HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD THIS AFFAIR BECAUSE SHE NAGGED AT HIM ALL THE TIME. "WHERE ARE YOU GOING? "WHO ARE YOU GONNA BE WITH? "WHO YOU MEETING WITH? "WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE? IS IT A FEMALE? IS SHE BEAUTIFUL? IS SHE YOUNG?" AND HE SAID THAT DROVE HIM TO DO THAT. "WELL, IF SHE'S GONNA BLAME ME FOR THAT, I MIGHT AS WELL JUST DO IT." Dr. Jordan: BUT IN THE END, HE LEAVES YOU WITH A WARNING - "IF SHE HAD BEEN A BETTER WIFE, IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED." Nancy: THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO FIND OUT, "WHAT DO I NEED TO DO? WHAT CAN I DO BETTER?" Narrator: AFTER MICHAEL ADMITS TO THE AFFAIR, NANCY'S LEFT ON EDGE, BUT SHE'S DETERMINED TO DO WHATEVER'S NECESSARY TO KEEP HER MARRIAGE INTACT. BILL. HEY. YEAH. WHY WOULD YOU WANT THE MAN WHO HAD A LONG HISTORY OF CHEATING? BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD THIS SAYING - "ONCE A CHEATER, ALWAYS A CHEATER." BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE DIFFERENT. YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONE THAT HE IS GOING TO BE FAITHFUL TO AND LOVE AND STICK BY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER ONES. "I'M NOT LAZY LIKE HE SAID SHE WAS. "I'M A VERY HARD WORKER. "SHE NEVER COOKED. "WELL, I'M A WONDERFUL COOK. I LOVE TO COOK." NAH, NO, MY WIFE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT HER TO KNOW, YOU KNOW. "I'M NOT LIKE THEM, SO HE'LL BE OKAY WITH ME." Dr. Jordan: IF SHE COULD BE A BETTER PERSON, A BETTER LITTLE GIRL, NOT DISPLEASING TO THOSE AROUND HER, THEN MAYBE HE WOULD STICK WITH HER FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Narrator: NANCY BECOMES OBSESSED WITH PLEASING MICHAEL. BUT DESPITE ALL HER EFFORTS, THINGS ONLY GET WORSE. JUST SEEMED THAT THEY WERE STARTING TO LIVE TWO DIFFERENT LIVES - NOT DOING THE THINGS TOGETHER AS MUCH ANYMORE. IT WAS A QUIET PULLING AWAY. Narrator: MICHAEL STARTS SPENDING MORE TIME AT WORK AND COMING HOME LATE AT NIGHT. SIT DOWN. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE BILLS? Narrator: NANCY CLAIMS THAT MICHAEL HAS A SHORT FUSE AND BECOMES SEXUALLY AND VERBALLY AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS HER. Brown: HE BELITTLED HER ALL THE TIME. HER RESPONSE TO IT WAS SHE WAS VERY QUIET, SHE WAS NON-CONFRONTATIONAL, AND THEN SHE WOULD JUST TRY TO PLEASE HIM. SO, SHE WOULD SHE JUST TRY TO FIND A SOLUTION SO THAT HE WOULDN'T BE SO MAD. SPENDING THAT KIND OF MONEY! I'M SORRY. HE DID GET ANGRY AND YELL AT ME, AND I DON'T LIKE BEING YELLED AT. I WAS AFRAID OF HIM, AND THEN THE SEX GOT MORE AGGRESSIVE. Narrator: BUT WHATEVER NANCY SAYS, HER DAUGHTER, RACHEL, REMEMBERS THINGS DIFFERENTLY. I WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL WOULD FORCE HIMSELF UPON MY MOTHER. I NEVER SAW ANY BRUISES ON MY MOTHER. IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE HER HAPPY. HE HAD OFTEN STATED THAT SHE WAS VERY PHYSICAL WITH HIM BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED, AND THEN, WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED, SHE TURNED COLD. AS LONG AS HE KEPT SHELLING OUT THE MONEY AND GIVING HER WHAT SHE WANTED, THEN SHE WAS MORE APT TO BEING ROMANTIC. LET'S SAY WE, UH, GO INSIDE THE BEDROOM AND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE UP THERE. Dr. Jordan: WOMEN WHO SUFFERED ABUSE, ESPECIALLY SEXUAL ABUSE, AS CHILDREN OFTEN PERCEIVE ANY SEXUAL ADVANCE AGAINST THEM TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND UNWARRANTED. YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF THE SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP SHE WOULD HAVE WITH MICHAEL WAS REALLY JUST SET UP FOR FAILURE. Narrator: DESPITE GROWING FURTHER AND FURTHER APART, MICHAEL AND NANCY MANAGE TO STAY TOGETHER FOR SEVEN YEARS, BUT IT'S A SHELL OF A MARRIAGE. FINALLY, IN THE FALL OF 2006, NANCY CLAIMS THAT MICHAEL DROPS A BOMBSHELL. I HAVE NEEDS, AND IF THEY AREN'T FILLED HERE, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE THE HOUSE. AFTER A SEXUAL EXPERIENCE WITH HIM, HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA BE HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH OTHER WOMEN. "IF THERE WAS NO LAW AGAINST HAVING MORE THAN ONE WIFE, "I WOULD HAVE MULTIPLE WIVES BECAUSE I NEED MULTIPLE SEXUAL EXPERIENCES." Dr. Jordan: AND DID YOU LOOK AT HIM WITH A WHOLE NEW - WHOLE NEW EYES. WHOLE NEW EYES. IT'S AN "AHA" MOMENT. Narrator: NOW NANCY IS CONVINCED MICHAEL IS CHEATING ON HER, AND SHE SEES EVIDENCE EVERYWHERE SHE TURNS. TO HER, EVEN INNOCENT ENCOUNTERS LOOK LIKE DANGEROUS FLIRTATIONS. Nancy: IT'S THE REAL MICHAEL. IT'S THE SEXUAL PREDATOR, AND I COULD SEE IT. Dr. Jordan: THE SEVEN-YEAR ITCH IN RELATIONSHIPS IS A VERY REAL THING, AND WHEN NANCY STARTED LOOKING AT MICHAEL AND WONDERING IF HE WAS STEPPING OUT ON HER, SHE STARTED LOOKING FOR HIM TO FAIL HER JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER MEN IN HER LIFE HAD. I CAN THINK OF SOME EXTRA-CREDIT WORK MAYBE. [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: BUT, AGAIN, ACCORDING TO RACHEL, MICHAEL'S INFIDELITY IS ALL IN NANCY'S HEAD. YOU KNOW YOU'RE CAPABLE OF MUCH BETTER WORK. I COULD NEVER PICTURE MICHAEL AS ONE TO HAVE AN AFFAIR. Narrator: NANCY'S OBSESSION THAT MICHAEL IS CHEATING KEEPS HER UP AT NIGHT. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NEW, CONFIDENT NANCY? SHE BECAME THAT LITTLE MOUSE AGAIN, FOR A MOMENT, AND SHE DECIDED THAT SHE'S GONNA CHECK ON THIS ALL HERSELF. "I'M NOT GONNA JUST LAY DOWN AND LET THIS HAPPEN TO ME." SO, WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? I HAD HIS PASSWORD TO HIS E-MAIL. Narrator: ONE AFTERNOON, WHILE MICHAEL'S AT WORK, NANCY GOES ON THE HUNT FOR PROOF. MICHAEL'S SECRETS SPARK A SHOWDOWN. ...WEBSITES YOU'VE GONE TO. HE HAD A BUNCH OF E-MAILS THAT WERE TO OTHER WOMEN. YOU STAY WITH ME, AND YOU STOP THAT! Narrator: NANCY AND MICHAEL ANDERSON'S SEVEN-YEAR MARRIAGE IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE. NANCY SUSPECTS MICHAEL IS LYING TO HER ABOUT HIS SEXUAL EXPLOITS WITH OTHER WOMEN. DESPERATE FOR HARD EVIDENCE, SHE HACKS INTO HIS E-MAIL. Nancy: SO, I CHECKED HIS E-MAILS AND FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS ON PORNOGRAPHY SITES AND SOLICITING WOMEN THAT HE WAS SUPPOSEDLY HAVING BUSINESS MEETINGS WITH. I THINK MICHAEL USED WHATEVER HE COULD TO MEET WOMEN - THAT MY MOM WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HIM. Narrator: NOW THAT SHE'S SCRATCHED THE SURFACE, NANCY NEEDS TO KNOW MORE. SHE CONTACTS ONE OF THE WOMEN SHE BELIEVES MICHAEL'S BEEN TALKING TO ONLINE. THEY MEET AT A DOWNTOWN CAFE. ACCORDING TO NANCY, THE WOMAN REVEALS THAT THE MEETING SHE AND MICHAEL HAD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUSINESS-RELATED BUT QUICKLY TURNED PERSONAL. HE STARTED ASKING ME PERSONAL THINGS, LIKE, "ARE YOU MARRIED?" WHEN YOU FIRST MET MICHAEL, ISN'T THAT WHAT HE DID WITH YOU? YEP. BECAUSE WOMEN ARE VERY VULNERABLE WHEN THEY'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S ON THE ROCKS, AND THAT'S WHEN HE ATTACKS. Narrator: BUT NANCY HAS HER OWN PLAN OF ATTACK. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHAT? SHE CONFRONTS MICHAEL, GRILLING HIM ABOUT HIS WEB-WOMANIZING. HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY BUSINESS MEETINGS? CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING? ARE YOU **** HER, LIKE, OUTSIDE? WHAT? NANCY HAD TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD GOTTEN INTO HIS E-MAIL AND THAT HE HAD A BUNCH OF E-MAILS IN THERE THAT WERE TO OTHER WOMEN. Narrator: MICHAEL INSISTS HE'S BEING FAITHFUL AND STILL WANTS TO WORK ON THE MARRIAGE, BUT NANCY DOESN'T BELIEVE HIM. NO, YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE THE HOUSE! YOU STAY WITH ME, AND YOU STOP THAT! YOU STOP IT! NANCY'S DEVASTATED. SHE MOVES INTO A GUEST BEDROOM WHILE DECIDING WHAT TO DO NEXT. Dr. Jordan: AT SOME POINT, NANCY GOES BACK TO FEELING LIKE A VICTIM - GIVING UP, "THERE IS NO HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER. "I KEEP TRYING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE I CAN DO TO MAKE THIS WORK" - AND IT REALLY SEEMS TO BE LEADING TO A BOILING POINT. Dr. Jordan: YOU'VE READ THE E-MAILS, YOU MET WITH A POTENTIAL GIRLFRIEND OF HIS. WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS ALMOST LIKE A "DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE" TURN-AROUND IN HIS PERSONALITY. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS. SO WHY NOT GO RUNNING FROM THE HOUSE, GET A DIVORCE, AND GET A NICE SETTLEMENT? BECAUSE MARRIAGE IS A COMMITMENT, AND I LOVED HIM. I REALLY WANTED IT TO WORK. I TOLD MY MOM THAT SHE SHOULD GET OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP, FIND ANOTHER GUY, JUST KEEP MOVING, KEEP GOING FORWARD. Brown: I THINK NANCY KNEW THAT SHE NEEDED TO LEAVE HIM, BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP. YOU KNOW, "IS THIS MY FAULT? "MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE OF THE SEXUAL ACTS THAT HE WAS ASKING FOR." AND SHE HAD A LOT OF GUILT THAT IT WAS HER FAULT THAT THIS WASN'T WORKING. Narrator: BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, NANCY JUST CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING THAT HE'S CHEATING. ONE AFTERNOON, SHE'S SNOOPING THROUGH HIS CREDIT-CARD RECORDS WHEN SHE FINDS WHAT SHE THINKS IS PROOF OF AN AFFAIR. 'CAUSE I FOUND THE RECEIPT FOR WHAT HE SENT HIS BOSS' SECRETARY FOR VALENTINE'S DAY. THEN I E-MAILED HIS BOSS AND TOLD HER WHAT HE WAS UP TO. SHE BLEW ME OFF. SHE GOES, "I DON'T BELIEVE YOU." SOME PEOPLE WOULD DESCRIBE THESE MEASURES ON YOUR BEHALF AS BEING VINDICTIVE. WERE YOU HOPING HE WOULD BE FIRED? YES. I WAS HOPING HE WOULD LOSE HIS JOB. HE WASN'T TRUSTWORTHY. THAT MAY MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER EMOTIONALLY, BUT IF YOU ARE ON THE ROAD TO SPLITTING UP, IT'S GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT IN THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS IF HE DOESN'T HAVE EMPLOYMENT. I DIDN'T CARE. YOU JUST DIDN'T CARE. NO. I HAVE MY OWN JOB. I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIS. SHE HAS MOVED FROM SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS TO MORAL SUPERIORITY. EVEN IF HE GETS FIRED AND THEY GET DIVORCED, THIS WOULD HAVE HUGE RAMIFICATIONS ON HER ALIMONY OR HER SETTLEMENT, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO NANCY, BECAUSE SHE IS RIGHT, HE IS WRONG, HE IS IMMORAL, AND EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW. Narrator: AND YET, IN THE FACE OF TOTAL DISTRUST AND CONTEMPT FOR HER HUSBAND, NANCY STILL DESPERATELY TRIES TO HOLD ON. IN A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE THEIR MARRIAGE, THEY DECIDE TO SEE A COUPLES' COUNSELOR. AS SOON AS MICHAEL REAPPLIES HIMSELF TO THE MARRIAGE AND TRIES TO MAKE IT WORK, SHE RESUMES HER ROLE OF VICTIM AGAIN, AND SO THE MARRIAGE IS CONTINUALLY DOOMED. Narrator: APRIL 15, 2007. IT'S A SUNNY SUNDAY AFTERNOON, THE DAY BEFORE THE ANDERSONS' FIRST COUNSELING APPOINTMENT, AND THE COUPLE IS ON EDGE. Nancy: I THOUGHT, "OH, I NEED A GLASS OF WINE [Laughing] 'CAUSE I NEED TO STAY CALM HERE." SO, TELL ME, MICHAEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS COUNSELING BUSINESS - IS IT GONNA WORK FOR US? WHAT DO YOU THINK, NANCY? WHAT KIND OF ANSWER IS THAT? YES OR NO! NO. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT, NANCY, OKAY? HOW'S THAT FOR AN ANSWER? THAT'S JUST FINE. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] Narrator: NANCY SAYS THAT MICHAEL'S RESPONSE SENDS HER INTO A TAILSPIN. ACCORDING TO MICHAEL, NANCY STARTS FRANTICALLY COLLECTING ARMFULS OF GIFTS HE'D GIVEN HER AND THROWING THEM IN THE TRASH. SHE CLAIMS MICHAEL REACTS BY CONFRONTING HER ABOUT JEOPARDIZING HIS JOB. NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU HADN'T STARTED MEDDLING IN MY BUSINESS, CALLING MY BOSS. OH, YEAH? I WOULDN'T HAVE TO CALL YOUR BOSS IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR PANTS ON. HE'S ASKING ME ABOUT HIS BOSS - WHY DID I CALL HER? SO, HE WAS ARGUING WITH ME. HE WAS VERY, VERY ANGRY AND VERY CLOSE TO MY FACE. [ Chuckling ] IN HIS ANGER, HE KNOWS HOW TO INTIMIDATE. HE STARTED COMING AT ME, AND I THREW A GLASS OF WINE IN HIS FACE. Narrator: ACCORDING TO NANCY, MICHAEL'S RAGE QUICKLY TURNS PHYSICAL. BITCH! I AM SO TIRED OF YOU! THIS MARRIAGE IS OVER! AND THERE WAS SOME TUSSLE, AND HE'S STRONG. I WAS SCARED. WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE. YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME. Narrator: MICHAEL DENIES EVER PUSHING OR SHOVING NANCY. IN FACT, EVIDENCE LATER PRESENTED IN COURT SHOWS THAT NANCY WAS THE AGGRESSOR AND MICHAEL ENDS UP BATTERED AND BRUISED. I CAN'T BELIEVE A THING THAT YOU'RE SAYING TO ME! Dr. Jordan: YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IS THIS THE DESPERATE PUSHBACK OF A WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT HER HUSBAND IS OFFICIALLY DONE? HE'S DONE FIGHTING. HE'S DONE WITH THE MARRIAGE. AND HER PUSHING HIM IS REALLY ALMOST A PROVOCATION - "PLEASE CARE, PLEASE COME BACK, PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO TRY TO SAVE THIS." ARE THINGS CALMER NOW? SOMEWHAT, BUT I'M STILL VERY SCARED 'CAUSE IT'S NOT OVER. I COULD JUST TELL IT'S NOT OVER. IT'S AN INSTINCT. Narrator: WHILE MICHAEL GOES UPSTAIRS TO CHANGE, NANCY CALLS HER DAUGHTER, RACHEL. HI. HOW'S IT GOING? YOU DOING ALL RIGHT? ARE YOU OKAY? [ Chuckling ] EVERYTHING'S FINE. DO YOU HAPPEN TO REMEMBER MY PASSWORD... Nancy: JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE REMEMBERED MY CHECKING-ACCOUNT PASSWORD AND THE PASSWORD TO MY COMPUTER. Dr. Jordan: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS MY LAST NIGHT ON EARTH. Narrator: BUT ACCORDING TO RACHEL, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS. HER MOTHER NEVER GIVES HER ANY FINANCIAL INFORMATION OR TELLS HER THAT SHE FEELS THREATENED. Sausser: JUST KIND OF STARTED TALKING - "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" SHE SAID, "ARE YOU GONNA BE UP FOR A LITTLE BIT?" AND I SAID, "YES, A LITTLE WHILE. WHAT'S A LITTLE BIT?" AND SHE SAYS, "I DON'T KNOW - ABOUT A HALF HOUR." AND I SAID, "WELL, SURE." AND SHE SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW, I'LL CALL YOU BACK IN HALF AN HOUR." AND I SAID, "OKAY," AND, "THIS IS STRANGE." THERE WAS NO INDICATION IN HER VOICE TO ME THAT SHE WAS IN ANY DANGER, THEY WERE FIGHTING, OR ANY OF THAT. NANCY, THIS IS OVER, OKAY? I'M DONE WITH IT. Narrator: MEANWHILE, MICHAEL REAPPEARS, TELLING NANCY HE'S SETTING THE STAGE FOR DIVORCE. NANCY, I'M SPLITTING EVERYTHING UP, OKAY? I'M GONNA DIVIDE EVERYTHING. AND WAS THERE ANYTHING OVERT IN HIS BEHAVIOR TO INDICATE... HE WAS STILL ANGRY. YOU COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE. Narrator: THOUGH NANCY CLAIMS SHE'S TERRIFIED, SHE DOESN'T FLEE THE HOUSE. I'M REALLY SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT! Dr. Jordan: BUT IF YOU'RE THAT CERTAIN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DIE THAT NIGHT AT THE HANDS OF YOUR HUSBAND - YOU HAVE A CAR, YOU HAVE KEYS, YOU HAVE GOOD CREDIT, YOU COULD GO TO A MOTEL - WHY STAY? I CAN TAKE WHATEVER HE'S GONNA DISH OUT 'CAUSE IT'LL BE OKAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY? BECAUSE, NANCY, IF YOU THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU, CLEARLY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE OKAY. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU WERE ALMOST SUICIDAL? YEAH. [ Voice breaking ] I'VE BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH IN LIFE THAT STARTING OVER IS REALLY DIFFICULT. I STARTED OVER SO MANY TIMES. I WAS TIRED. IT'S OKAY IF I DIDN'T HAVE - DIDN'T START OVER AGAIN. HEY, NANCY, YOU KNOW, I REALIZED THAT ALL THE CARS ARE MINE, SO YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY OF THOSE. WHEN MICHAEL SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE MARRIED TO NANCY ANYMORE, IT WAS SIMPLY MORE THAN NANCY COULD TAKE. Narrator: NANCY REALIZES THAT, THIS TIME, HER MARRIAGE REALLY IS OVER AND CONSIDERS ONE LAST DESPERATE ACT TO KEEP MICHAEL FROM LEAVING HER. IT WAS OKAY FOR IT TO END, THEN. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHAT? Narrator: AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF ACCUSATIONS AND DENIALS... YOU **** HER, LIKE, OUTSIDE? ...NANCY AND MICHAEL ANDERSON HAVE JUST HAD THE FIGHT THAT WILL PUSH THEIR MARRIAGE OVER THE FINISH LINE. WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE. MICHAEL IS IN HIS OFFICE, PUTTING TOGETHER PAPERS TO FILE FOR DIVORCE. AFTER CLEANING UP THE KITCHEN, NANCY, WHILE HOLDING A CHEF'S KNIFE, APPROACHES HER HUSBAND WITH A SIMPLE QUESTION. [ Voice breaking ] I JUST WAS GONNA ASK HIM ABOUT SUPPER 'CAUSE WE HADN'T EATEN YET. Narrator: ACCORDING TO NANCY, ALTHOUGH MICHAEL IS FACING AWAY FROM HER, HIS BODY LANGUAGE IS THREATENING. SO, I JUST WALKED UP BEHIND HIM... WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR DINNER? ...AND HE HAD HIS HANDS DOWN AT THE KEYBOARD AND HE STARTED TO GET UP, AND HE WAS LIKE, "I DON'T WANT IT!" Narrator: SUDDENLY, BEFORE SHE KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, SHE PLUNGES THE KNIFE IN HIS BACK. [ Crying ] IT WAS JUST A REACTION. IT WAS JUST A REACTION. I JUST - I JUST TOOK THE KNIFE, AND I STABBED HIM IN THE BACK OF THE SHOULDER. AND HE TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "WHAT DID YOU DO?" ...CRAZY. I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW." Narrator: NANCY INSISTS SHE ATTACKED MICHAEL ON IMPULSE OUT OF FEAR. BUT ACCORDING TO COURT TESTIMONY, NANCY INTENTIONALLY GRABBED A KNIFE IN A COLD-BLOODED ACT OF RAGE AND REVENGE. NANCY? MICHAEL'S VERSION WAS THAT HE WAS CALLING HER AND SHE DIDN'T ANSWER AND HE TURNED AROUND AND SHE WASN'T THERE AND HE TURNED BACK AROUND TO THE COMPUTER AND THEN HE FELT THE KNIFE IN HIS BACK AND HE STOOD UP AND WAS LIKE, "WHAT HAPPENED?" WHAT DID YOU DO? WHAT'S GOING ON? AND MY MOM SAID, "DON'T WORRY. IT'LL ALL BE OVER SOON, MICHAEL." COME ON. HE SAID HE WAS SOMEWHAT KNEELING KIND OF ON ALL FOURS ON THE GROUND, AND SHE LAY DOWN NEXT TO HIM, PATTED THE GROUND, AND SAID, "COME LAY NEXT TO ME, MICHAEL. "COME LAY NEXT TO ME. I WANT YOU TO FEEL THE PAIN THAT I FEEL RIGHT NOW." [ GROANS ] IT WAS EVERYONE THROUGH HER ENTIRE LIFE WHO HAD HURT HER, ABANDONED HER, REJECTED HER, OR REFUSED TO LOVE HER. IT WAS JUST THE RELEASE OF EMOTION AS THAT KNIFE PLUNGED IN HIS BACK THAT WAS WHAT SHE NEEDED AT THAT EXACT MOMENT, AND MICHAEL WAS SIMPLY AT THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. [ GROANING ] COME ON. LIE DOWN. Narrator: COURT DOCUMENTS CONTEND THAT NANCY MAKES NO EFFORT TO HELP HIM, EVEN THOUGH HE'S BLEEDING BADLY. [ Weakly ] NANCY. IN FACT, POLICE BELIEVE SHE TOOK HIS CELLPHONE AND CUT ALL THE HOUSE-PHONE LINES TO PREVENT HIM FROM CALLING FOR HELP. MICHAEL STARTS TO PANIC. HE'S IN AGONIZING PAIN AND HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING. INSTEAD OF CALLING 911, NANCY CALLS HER DAUGHTER, RACHEL. YOU'RE SCARING ME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. Sausser: AND I SAID, "MOM, WHAT'S GOING ON?" AND SHE SAID, "MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME OUT HERE, RACHEL," AND I JUST KEPT HEARING MICHAEL IN THE BACKGROUND, SHOUTING, "RACHEL, PLEASE CALL 911," AND SO I HUNG UP. WE, OF COURSE, TOOK OFF. SAM, WE GOT TO GO. Narrator: RACHEL RACES OVER TO HER MOTHER'S WITH HER HALF-BROTHER, SAM. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOU DIDN'T CALL 911? I MEAN, AS A NURSE, YOU DO KNOW THAT YOU NEED AN AMBULANCE, THAT THIS IS SERIOUS. I KNOW, BUT I WANTED MY DAUGHTER THERE WITH ME. RACHEL'S NOT MEDICAL HELP. THE DISCONNECT IS WHY YOU DIDN'T CALL 911. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT. AND HE WASN'T BEGGING YOU TO GET HIM MEDICAL ATTENTION? NO. Sausser: MOM?! Samuel: MOM?! WHEN THEY ARRIVE, RACHEL AND SAM ARE STUNNED BY WHAT THEY SEE. Sausser: WE WALKED INTO THE KITCHEN, AND MICHAEL WAS STANDING STRAIGHT AHEAD OF ME, LEANING OVER THE COUNTER WITH A KNIFE STICKING OUT OF HIS BACK. WHAT JUST HAPPENED? Samuel: I WAS SHOCKED. NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WOULD I EVER IMAGINE MY MOM COMMITTING ANY KIND OF VIOLENT ACT. Sausser: I LOOKED AT MY MOM, AND I SAID, "OH, MY GOD. WHAT HAPPENED?" SHE JUST KIND OF LOOKED AT ME, AND I DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE FROM ANYONE, SO I TOLD SAM TO CALL 911. MOM WAS LIKE, "DON'T CALL 911. DON'T CALL 911." NO, DON'T DO IT. Narrator: SAM IGNORES HIS MOTHER AND MAKES THE CALL. Sausser: I THINK THAT HER INTENTIONS WERE FOR HIM TO NOT LIVE. I WAS SHOCKED. SHE WAS STANDING THERE LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED, LIKE, NOT EVEN TRYING TO HELP HIM, NO CONCERN AT ALL. SHE WAS ACTING OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD A KNIFE HANGING OUT OF HIS SHOULDER BLADE. MOM, WHAT HAPPENED? [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: A FEW MINUTES LATER, POLICE AND PARAMEDICS ARRIVE. INCREDIBLY, NANCY CLAIMS EVEN NOW, MICHAEL DEFENDED HER. Nancy: HE TOLD THEM THAT - WHAT DID HE SAY? "SHE DIDN'T MEAN IT." Narrator: THE MEDICS RUSH MICHAEL TO THE HOSPITAL. HE'S IN CRITICAL CONDITION. Sausser: YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, DAD, OKAY? YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY. THE KNIFE PIERCED HIS LUNG AND NARROWLY MISSED HIS HEART. HE'S LOST 20% OF HIS BLOOD. NANCY IS ARRESTED AND TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. SHE HAD A LOOK ON HER FACE THAT WAS LIKE A DEER IN HEADLIGHTS. HER EYES WERE GLASSED OVER. THERE WAS NO RAGE, NO ANGER. SHE JUST LOOKED VERY CONFUSED. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. Narrator: WHEN QUESTIONED, NANCY REPEATEDLY CHANGES HER STORY. AND I TRIPPED ON... AT FIRST, SHE SAID SHE WAS CUTTING AN APPLE AND SHE TRIPPED ON A PLASTIC RUNNER, THEN SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS DRINKING A LOT, AND THEN SHE SAID SHE DID IT OUT OF SELF-DEFENSE BECAUSE HE WAS YELLING AT HER. SO, I HEARD THREE DIFFERENT STORIES. Narrator: MIRACULOUSLY, MICHAEL SURVIVES THE ATTACK. MONTHS LATER AT TRIAL, NANCY CLAIMS SELF-DEFENSE, BATTERED-WOMAN SYNDROME, AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AS A RESULT OF HER ABUSE AS A CHILD. AND YET, WHEN YOU ASK HER ABOUT SPECIFICS, SHE REALLY CAN'T LIST MUCH MORE THAN SHOUTING, YELLING, PUSHING, SHOVING, AND THE FACT THAT HER MOTHER REALLY DISLIKED HER. BUT DISLIKING HER, EVEN HITTING HER WITH A BELT, IS USUALLY NOT TANTAMOUNT TO THE LEVEL OF ABUSE THAT'S NEEDED FOR THESE SORTS OF DEFENSES. Narrator: ON MAY 28, 2009, NANCY ANDERSON IS CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER AND SENTENCED TO 19 YEARS IN PRISON. Dr. Jordan: DO YOU THINK IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE? NO. IT WAS FEAR, BUT IT WAS MY OWN REALITY FEAR. IT WAS IN MY OWN MIND. YOU RECOGNIZE THAT? THERE WAS NO ANGER AT ALL. I WASN'T ANGRY AT HIM ABOUT ANYTHING. IT WAS JUST SELF-PRESERVATION. NOT SELF-DEFENSE, BUT SELF-PRESERVATION. YEAH. FOR ME, IT WAS. Narrator: TODAY IN PRISON, NANCY'S WORKING ON A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN THEOLOGY. SHE'LL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE IN 2014. THE QUESTION IS, IF SHE GOT OUT, WOULD SHE DO THIS AGAIN? I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY NO AS LONG AS YOU DON'T LOVE HER AND LEAVE HER. DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A VIOLENT OR CRIMINAL PERSON? NO. I HAD ONE ACT OF... OF WHAT? ...RETALIATION - I GUESS YOU CAN CALL IT - IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. IT DOESN'T DEFINE WHO I AM. I REALLY AM A GOOD PERSON WHO DID SOMETHING WRONG, AND IT'S NOT WHO I AM.
