 Narrator: NOT ALL FAIRY TALES HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS. [ WOMAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] WHEN LOVE GOES WRONG, A WOMAN CAN DO THE UNTHINKABLE. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS MAY 1993, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND. FOR 14-YEAR-OLD JAMEELAH JONES, DANGER LURKS AROUND EVERY CORNER OF HER NEIGHBORHOOD. DID YOU MISS ME? HUH? WHAT'S HAPPENING? DON'T PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME. Narrator: SHE LIVES IN A ROUGH PART OF TOWN RIDDLED WITH CRIME AND VIOLENCE. JAMEELAH IS ONLY A TEENAGER, BUT SHE'S ALREADY LEARNING A TOUGH GROWN-UP LESSON. LIFE FOR ME AIN'T BEEN NO CRYSTAL STAIR, HONEY. BELIEVE THAT. I GREW UP IN A CRACK ERA. I GREW UP IN A VIOLENT ERA. IT WAS A DEVASTATING TIME. HEY! Narrator: INSIDE JAMEELAH'S HOME, THINGS AREN'T ANY BETTER. WHERE YOUR MAMA? I DON'T KNOW. [ SCOFFS ] HEY, WOMAN! HER FATHER ISN'T IN THE PICTURE, AND HER MOTHER IS A BAD JUDGE OF CHARACTER. DO EVERYTHING I GOT TO DO. I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU, GIRL! YOU DON'T EVEN - I'M SORRY! I WITNESSED A LOT OF ABUSE, A LOT OF PHYSICAL ABUSE. MY MAMA USED TO GET HER ASS WHIPPED, BABY. DON'T MAKE ME SMACK YOU, GIRL! AAH! SEE WHAT YOU MADE ME DO?! SEE, MY MAMA WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT COULDN'T SPEND TWO MONTHS WITHOUT A MAN IN HER BED. SO, GROWING UP IN ALL THAT CHAOS AND THEN BEING REARED BY A MAMA WHO, HER MAN IS GONNA COME BEFORE HER KIDS... HE AIN'T NO GOOD. BUT HE LOVES ME. ...IT HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON ME. Narrator: BUT FOR THIS SMART AND AMBITIOUS YOUNG GIRL, HER TROUBLES ONLY SERVE TO IGNITE A SPARK WITHIN. MY OLDEST SISTER ENDED UP DOING THE SAME DAMN THING MY MAMA DID - MARRIED YOUNG, HAVING THESE BABIES. Narrator: DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. JAMEELAH GROWS UP IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE SHE SEES HER MOTHER BEING ABUSED, AND SO SHE REALIZES FROM AN EARLY AGE THAT SHE IS DESTINED TO REPEAT HER MOTHER'S MISTAKES LIKE HER SISTER HAS, OR SHE CAN CHOOSE TO BREAK THE PATTERN. AND THIS WILL DETERMINE HOW SHE TURNS OUT. Jones: I KNEW I WAS SMART. I DIDN'T WANT TO FALL VICTIM TO THAT. Dr. Jordan: WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE THAT DESTINY? I THINK IT IS SCHOOL, BECAUSE SCHOOL WAS MY ONLY ESCAPE. SCHOOL WAS THE ONLY THING THAT I HAD THAT I KNEW IF I DID WELL HERE IN THIS ARENA, THIS WAS WHAT WAS GONNA GET ME UP OUT THE 'HOOD. THIS IS WHAT WAS GONNA MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE. [ SIRENS WAILING ] MAMA, DID YOU GET THE MAIL? YES. Narrator: JAMEELAH'S HARD WORK PAYS OFF WHEN SHE'S ACCEPTED INTO A MAGNET PROGRAM FOR GIFTED TEENS. CONGRATULATIONS! AAH! OH! AND AT THE AGE OF 15, JAMEELAH TRANSFERS TO A NEW SCHOOL ACROSS TOWN. Jones: IN WAS AN ARRAY OF OPPORTUNITY. IT WAS A MAGNET PROGRAM FOR LAW. AND SO I ROCKED THAT, DID IT HARD, DID IT WELL. [ BELL RINGS ] Narrator: JAMEELAH CONTINUES TO EXCEL AT SCHOOL. SHE DREAMS OF GOING TO COLLEGE AND BECOMING A LAWYER. BUT SUCCESS ISN'T THE ONLY THING ON JAMEELAH'S MIND. HEY, TYLER. THIS IS JAMEELAH. JAMEELAH, TYLER. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. SO, YOU GUYS GOING TO THE DANCE? MAYBE. Narrator: SHE BADLY WANTS A BOYFRIEND, SOMEONE WHO'S SWEET AND CARING, UNLIKE THE MEN HER MOTHER KEEPS BRINGING HOME. HE TOTALLY LIKES YOU. TRUST ME. HIS MAMA IS NOT GONNA LET HIM DATE SOMEBODY FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD. OH, COME ON. JAMEELAH KNOWS THAT SHE WANTS TO GET AWAY FROM THE GUYS ON THE STREET, AND YET SHE DOESN'T FEEL GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE BOYS IN HER PRIVILEGED HIGH SCHOOL. SHE STILL WANTS A BOYFRIEND, BUT THIS DILEMMA LEAVES HER VERY VULNERABLE TO POOR CHOICES. Narrator: ONE DAY, A HANDSOME YOUNG STRANGER MAKES HER CONSIDER BENDING THE RULES. TALK TO ME ABOUT MEETING JAMES. GIRL, I WAS - HE WAS ABOUT FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN ME. I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I SEEN THAT BOY. AT THAT TIME, I WAS SELLING DRUGS. SO, I HAD EVERYTHING. I HAD THE DRUG DEALER'S STARTER KIT. I HAD THE NICE CLOTHES. HEY, SHORTY. WHAT'S UP, BABY? SHE USED TO COME RIGHT ON THE AVENUE WHERE I FREQUENTED. Narrator: JAMES LIKES WHAT HE SEES. I'M GOING HOME. SHE HAD THE NICE LONG HAIR, PRETTY SKIN. SHE'S VERY BEAUTIFUL. YOU GOT A LOT GOING ON WITH ALL THESE EXPENSIVE CLOTHES. OH, YEAH. YOU LIKE THAT, HUH? Jones: HE WAS TALL. HE HAD THIS T-SHIRT ON. HE ALWAYS WORE THESE COOL-ASS T-SHIRTS. I WAS SO CAUGHT UP AND INFATUATED, AND I WANTED THAT MAN. I NEED A QUEEN FOR THIS BLING, YOU KNOW? Nixon: SHE WAS SMITTEN BY ME. YOU KNOW, I WAS LIKE HER PRINCE CHARMING. WE LOCKED ON EACH OTHER. I WANT TO GET YOUR NUMBER. I WANT TO CALL YOU LATER. Narrator: JAMEELAH KNOWS THAT JAMES IS BAD NEWS. MAYBE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU, I'LL SAY HELLO. OHH, IT'S LIKE THAT? AT THE MOMENT. ALL RIGHT, SHORTY. BUT THE ATTRACTION IS UNDENIABLE. BEFORE LONG, JAMEELAH AND JAMES ARE INSEPARABLE. WE BEGAN TO KNOW EACH OTHER ON A DEEPER LEVEL. SHE THOUGHT I WAS AN IDIOT AT THE TIME 'CAUSE I PLAYED THAT ROLE IN THE STREET 'CAUSE I HAD TO. YOU GOT TO BE MORE BRUTISH, SO PEOPLE REALLY DON'T KNOW YOU'RE INTELLIGENT. AND THEN SHE USED TO TELL ME, "COME TO FIND OUT, YOU'RE REALLY NOT LIKE THAT. I KNOW WHO YOU REALLY ARE." THAT WAS OUR FOUNDATION, AND WE BUILT OFF THAT. SHE FOUND OUT SHE HAD CANCER. JAMES HAD A HARD-KNOCK LIFE. HE REALLY DID. JAMES' MAMA PASSED AWAY WHEN HE WAS YOUNG. HIS FATHER WAS DEFINITELY A STREET DUDE. JAMES WAS FOLLOWING THE SAME PATH AS HIS FATHER, BUT JAMES WAS SMART. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO. Nixon: SHE WAS VERY SMART. SHE WAS OUT OF PLACE. BUT AS I SAID, SHE WAS INFLUENCED BY THE SAME THINGS. YOU KNOW, THE STREETS, BASICALLY, IT GOT US. Narrator: JAMEELAH IS SO IN LOVE, SHE DECIDES TO GIVE ALL OF HERSELF TO JAMES. BUT HIS REACTION SURPRISES HER. I THINK I'M READY, JAMES. YOU EMOTIONALLY BOND WITH HIM. GIRL, I WANTED TO GIVE JAMES MY VIRGINITY. I CAN'T. HAD THAT BOY COME UP TO THE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING. WELL, HE SAID TO ME, "YOU'RE TOO YOUNG." ONE DAY, WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA DO THAT. BUT JUST NOT RIGHT NOW. DID THAT SIGN OF RESPECT MAKE YOU FALL FOR HIM EVEN HARDER? IT DID. IT DID. BECAUSE COMING FROM MY BACKGROUND WITH A HOUSEHOLD OF WOMEN CONSTANTLY BEING DISRESPECTED, THOSE FEW WORDS, YEAH, THAT STUCK WITH ME. I LOVE YOU. 1996. AFTER TWO YEARS TOGETHER, JAMEELAH AND JAMES ARE TOTALLY DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER - THE ASPIRING YOUNG WOMAN AND THE COMMITTED CRIMINAL. BUT NOT EVERYONE IN JAMEELAH'S LIFE APPROVES. YES, I KNOW WHO HE IS. Jones: NOW, SEE, AUNT CORA, SHE'S THE MOTHER THAT I NEVER REALLY HAD. YOU MIGHT HAVE HER FOOLED, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ME FOOLED. I'M SORRY, BABY. HEY, THAT'S OKAY. Gordon: SHE SORT OF KEPT IT A SECRET. I TOLD HER, "YOU DON'T NEED HIM. YOU DON'T REALLY NEED HIM." BUT, OF COURSE, SHE DIDN'T LISTEN. THE GOOD GIRLS LIKE BAD BOYS. I DON'T KNOW. THEY THRIVE OFF OF IT. WHY, I DON'T KNOW. HE IS BRINGING YOU DOWN. DO YOU KNOW HE SELLS DRUGS? Narrator: BUT JAMEELAH TURNS A DEAF EAR TO HER AUNT'S CONCERNS. SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF JAMES. SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF THE SITUATION. SHE WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT. SOUNDS LIKE NO ONE COULD TELL YOU ANYTHING? THERE WASN'T NOBODY GONNA TELL ME A DAMN THING, 'CAUSE I WAS DOING WHAT I WANTED TO DO. YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. JAMEELAH! Dr. Jordan: JAMEELAH IS A TEENAGER. SHE'S GROWN UP ON THE STREETS. IT'S NOT SURPRISING SHE WOULD FALL FOR A GUY FROM THE STREETS BECAUSE THAT'S HER COMFORT ZONE. Narrator: WHILE JAMEELAH HAS HER SIGHTS SET ON COLLEGE, JAMES' FUTURE IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE SHADY. Nixon: I'M ESTABLISHED. I'M BIGGER THAN I WAS BEFORE. I'M GETTING INTO MORE TROUBLE. BY THAT TIME, I'D ALREADY BEEN TO TRIAL ABOUT TWICE FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER. I'M RUNNING AROUND WITH GUNS, A LOT OF VIOLENCE. NOW I'M GETTING MORE MONEY, SO NOW NATURALLY I HAVE TO PROTECT MYSELF. I HAVE A REPUTATION TO UPHOLD. Narrator: JAMEELAH GETS ACCEPTED TO A TOP-RANKED COLLEGE IN THE AREA. HER DREAMS OF A BRIGHT FUTURE ARE JUST WITHIN REACH. HOLD ON A SECOND. I THINK THAT'S MY GIRL. AND SHE CAN'T WAIT TO SHARE THE NEWS WITH THE MAN SHE LOVES. Dr. Jordan: YOU NEVER FEARED THAT HIS CHOICES WOULD DRAG YOU DOWN AND KEEP YOU FROM ACHIEVING YOUR GOALS? I REALLY DIDN'T. IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF WHAT I BELIEVED IN, BUT IT WAS WHERE I WAS FROM. SO I CAN'T JUDGE IT. I CAN'T POINT THE FINGER. "I'M A COLLEGE GIRL NOW. AND I'M GETTING CULTURED. "AND I'M BECOMING WORLDLY. AND I FORGET ABOUT WHERE I'M REALLY FROM"? I WASN'T THINKING LIKE THAT. BUT, SEE, THAT'S THE THING. MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN. YES, I GOT ACCEPTED! YOU GOT IN! YOU GOT IN! YES, I DID! 'SUP, MAN? YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT'S UP, O. G.? Narrator: AS JAMEELAH THRIVES IN COLLEGE, JAMES' CRIMINAL CAREER CONTINUES IN LOCKSTEP. LOOK OUT, MAN! LOOK OUT, MAN! WHAT YOU MEAN YOU AIN'T GOT IT, MAN? COMING UP, JAMES' LUCK RUNS OUT AND ALTERS THE COURSE OF THE YOUNG LOVERS' LIVES FOREVER. Narrator: DECEMBER, 1998. 20-YEAR-OLD JAMEELAH JONES IS ON THE PATH TO A PROMISING FUTURE. DESPITE GROWING UP SURROUNDED BY POVERTY AND CRIME, JAMEELAH IS ATTENDING A PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY. BUT HER BOYFRIEND, JAMES, IS A DRUG DEALER WHO'S COMMITTED TO A LIFE ON THE STREETS. WHAT YOU MEAN YOU AIN'T GOT IT, MAN? LOOK OUT! JAMES IS SUPPOSED TO PICK UP JAMEELAH AFTER MEETING WITH HIS PAROLE OFFICER. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] HELLO? HE SAID, "YO, BABE. I'M GONNA COME GET YOU. YOUR READY?" I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE READY." FIRST HOUR GOES BY. SECOND HOUR GOES BY. I'M NOT REALLY PAYING NO ATTENTION TO IT 'CAUSE JAMES MOVES THE WAY HE MOVE. IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LATE FOR A DATE. Narrator: BUT WHAT JAMEELAH DOESN'T KNOW IS JAMES IS RUNNING LATE BECAUSE HE'S MAKING A DRUG RUN. INSTEAD, HE MET UP WITH SOME FRIENDS. Nixon: THERE WAS THREE OF US. SO, NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THE MARIJUANA. THIS WAS LIKE, IT'S EXCLUSIVE. EVERYBODY CAN'T GO IN THERE. Narrator: ONE OF THE MEN ASKS THEM TO STOP. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. Nixon: WE'RE THINKING HE'S GOING TO ACTUALLY USE A PAY PHONE. HE JUMPS OUT, AND THERE WAS A CAB DIRECTLY BEHIND US. GIVE ME THE MONEY RIGHT NOW. GIVE ME THE MONEY. GIVE ME THE MONEY! Jones: WHAT THAT BOY ACTUALLY DID WAS GO TO THAT CAB DRIVER THAT WAS SITTING BEHIND HIM AND ROB THAT CAB DRIVER FOR $140. Nixon: AND THEN JUMPS IN THE CAR WITH US. HE DIDN'T EVEN TELL US WHAT HE DID, NOTHING. NO ONE KNEW, HAD KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HE DID. Narrator: COURT RECORDS CONTRADICT JAMES' CLAIMS THAT HE'S AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER. SO, THAT CAB DRIVER CALLED THE POLICE, AND IT WAS LITERALLY TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM MY HOUSE. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: POLICE PULL OVER THE CAR JAMES IS RIDING IN. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] GET OUT OF THE CAR! HANDS UP! YOU GONNA SHOOT ME, MAN?! YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE. I KNOW WHAT IT IS. I'M THINKING THEY'RE JUST PULLING US OVER, A ROUTINE STOP. Narrator: BUT JAMES SOON REALIZES THIS IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS. DAMN, MAN! AND THEN THEY SAID, "BRING IN THE COMPLAINANT WITNESS." I'M LIKE, COMPLAINANT WITNESS? CAME RIGHT UP TO MY CAB. SO NOW, THINGS ARE GETTING CRAZY. NOW IT'S SERIOUS FOR ME. I HAVE TWO FELONIES ALREADY. TAKE HIM AWAY. TAKE HIM AWAY. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. Narrator: POLICE ARREST ALL THREE MEN. COME ON, MAN! COME ON, MAN! [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] HOURS LATER, JAMEELAH GETS A PHONE CALL SHE WILL NEVER FORGET. HELLO? SO, I GOT THAT CALL, I MEAN, THAT DREADFUL CALL, THAT YOU PICK UP THE LINE, AND THE RECEIVER SAYS, "PLEASE HOLD." SO, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU GOT A CALL TO PLEASE HOLD, YOU KNOW SOMEBODY IS LOCKED UP. IT WAS JAMES. BYE. [ GAVEL BANGS ] HAS THE JURY REACHED A VERDICT? THE JURY FINDS THE DEFENDANT GUILTY. Nixon: I ALWAYS MAINTAINED MY INNOCENCE. EVERYONE ELSE COPPED OUT. AND I WENT TO TRIAL BY MYSELF, AND I GOT RAILROADED. I LOVE YOU, JAMEELAH. I'M SO SORRY. Jones: HE REALLY GOT SENTENCED TO A 12-FLAT FOR A ROBBERY FOR 140 PUNK-ASS DOLLARS. I FELT SO BAD FOR HIM, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. IT WAS SAD. [ CRYING ] HEY, BABY. HEY. Narrator: JAMEELAH REFUSES TO GIVE UP ON HER MAN. EVERY OTHER WEEKEND, SHE TAKES THE BUS TO VISIT HIM AT A MAXIMUM SECURITY FACILITY. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. SHE ALWAYS CAME, SHE ALWAYS WAS THERE FOR ME. THAT BASICALLY WIPES OUT HER WHOLE WEEKEND, SO SHE'S DEDICATED. I SEE THAT. IN MY HEART, I JUST YEARNED FOR HIM. I REALLY DID. IS THAT WHY YOU STUCK WITH HIM? IT WAS A SENSE OF, "DAMN, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HIM NOW. HE NEEDS SOMEBODY." IF JAMES HADN'T BEEN SENTENCED TO 12 YEARS FOR THE ROBBERY, IT'S PRETTY UNLIKELY THAT HE AND JAMEELAH WOULD HAVE STAYED TOGETHER. JAMES GOING TO PRISON WAS ALMOST A PERFECT SOLUTION. SHE COULD CONTROL THE SITUATION. SHE GETS HIS LOVE AND HIS LOYALTY, BUT SHE ALSO GETS TO PURSUE HER CAREER WHILE DECIDING WHAT SHE WILL DO WITH JAMES IN THE FUTURE. Narrator: OTHER THAN VISITING JAMES, JAMEELAH PUTS ALL OF HER FOCUS ON HER SCHOOLWORK. IN THE SUMMER OF 2000, JAMEELAH GRADUATES FROM COLLEGE AND ACCEPTS AN INTERNSHIP AT A RESPECTED LAW FIRM. BUT AS THE MONTHS PASS, JAMEELAH'S WORK DEMANDS KEEP HER IN THE OFFICE FOR LONGER HOURS, MAKING IT HARDER TO VISIT JAMES IN PRISON. LOOK, WHERE YOU BEEN? AS THE VISITS DWINDLE, JAMES DECIDES IT'S TIME TO HAVE A TALK WITH HIS CHILDHOOD LOVE. JAMES. I GOT TO GO. YEAH. [ PHONE SLAMS ] HELLO? [ Click ] HELLO? [ Dial tone ] I TOLD YOU I'D COME AND SEE YOU. YEAH. UH, YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED? THAT'S EXACTLY HOW HE SAID IT. "YO, YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?" I SAID, "ARE YOU FOR REAL?" HE SAID, "YEAH." I SAID, "OKAY, LET'S GET MARRIED." AND THAT'S HOW IT WENT DOWN. YEAH? YEAH. Narrator: BUT DEEP DOWN, JAMEELAH QUESTIONS JAMES' MOTIVATIONS. HEY. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED! IT SOUNDS LIKE ONCE HE WENT TO PRISON, HE WANTED TO LAY CLAIM ON YOU. JUST LIKE A DOG PISSING AT THE HYDRANT. YOU'RE MARKING YOUR TERRITORY. ANY MAN THAT ASKS YOU TO WAIT FOR THEM WHILE THEY GO TO SOME DAMN PRISON, THAT MAN DON'T LOVE YOU. Narrator: BUT JAMES CLAIMS THAT'S NOT HOW THINGS WENT DOWN. SINCE I CARE ABOUT YOU, I'M TELLING YOU, JUST GO. WHEN I TELL HER, I'M LIKE, "LISTEN. "GO LIVE YOUR LIFE, 'CAUSE I GOT TIME TO DO. I'M NOT COMING HOME FOR 10 YEARS." Narrator: HE ALSO SAYS THE MARRIAGE WAS JAMEELAH'S IDEA, AND HER MOTIVATIONS WEREN'T BASED ON LOVE, BUT SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY. LISTEN, I'M GONNA MARRY THIS GIRL, ALL RIGHT? IT'S FOR THE CONJUGAL VISITS. Nixon: I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST WITH JAMEELAH. I ALREADY HAD SOMETHING ON THE BACK BURNER. I HAD ANOTHER GIRL. I'M LIKE, "LISTEN, I'M GONNA GET SUCH AND SUCH. SHE'S GONNA MARRY ME FOR THE CONJUGAL VISITS." "OH, NO. NOT HER. I'M GONNA DO IT." SO, THIS IS HOW WE GOT HITCHED. YOU ARE MY MAN, AND IF YOU'RE GONNA MARRY ANYBODY, IT'S GONNA BE ME. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT? THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE. THAT WAS THE GIST OF THE CONVERSATION. SHE DIDN'T WANT NO OTHER WOMAN DOING IT FOR ME. ON HER OWN, SHE PUTS IN THE PAPERS FOR THE MARRIAGE. MEEMEE WANTS WHAT SHE WANTS WHEN SHE WANTS IT. SHE'S CONTROLLING LIKE THAT. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET MARRIED. IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE JAMES DID TELL JAMEELAH TO MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE WHEN HE GOT SENTENCED TO PRISON, BUT FOR JAMEELAH, THIS REALLY ISN'T AN OPTION. SHE'S INVESTED FIVE YEARS OF HER LIFE IN LOVING HIM, AND SHE SEES HER LOYALTY TO HIM AS A FURTHER INVESTMENT SO THAT HE WILL BE EVEN MORE GRATEFUL FOR HER WHEN HE GETS OUT. DO YOU, JAMEELAH, TAKE JAMES TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED HUSBAND? Narrator: REGARDLESS OF WHOSE IDEA IT WAS, THE YOUNG COUPLE GETS MARRIED AT THE PRISON CHAPEL ON JULY 7, 2001. Officiant: IN GOODNESS AND SORROW... I KEPT IT A SECRET. I DID. I MARRIED JAMES IN PRISON. MY FAMILY DIDN'T KNOW. I DIDN'T TELL THEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR ANYBODY'S OPINION. I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR, "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?" Narrator: EIGHT MORE YEARS PASS. JAMEELAH IS NOW A SUCCESSFUL PARALEGAL WITH A HUSBAND WHO'S STILL BEHIND BARS. Jones: I'M AT THE TOP OF MY "A" GAME. WHILE I'M DOING ALL OF THIS, I GOT THIS LITTLE SECRET. 'CAUSE, SEE, THE FOLKS I WORK WITH, THEY DIDN'T KNOW MY HUSBAND WAS IN JAIL AND EVERY WEEKEND, I'M GETTING ON THAT BUS. ALL RIGHT. SEE YA. Narrator: SHE'S DEDICATED PRACTICALLY EVERY WAKING MOMENT TO HER CAREER, ALL WHILE COUNTING THE DAYS UNTIL THE LOVE OF HER LIFE IS BACK IN HER ARMS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHEN JAMEELAH AND JAMES MARRY, JAMEELAH DECIDES TO KEEP THIS A SECRET NOT ONLY FROM HER FAMILY WHO DISAPPROVE OF JAMES, BUT FROM HER CO-WORKERS. BECAUSE BEING MARRIED TO A MAN IN PRISON IS COMPLETELY INCONSISTENT WITH HER PROFESSIONAL IMAGE. Narrator: AUGUST 2009, THE BIG DAY HAS FINALLY COME. JAMES IS RELEASED, AND JAMEELAH CAN FINALLY TURN THE PAGE ON THE DARK SHADOWS CLOUDING HER FAIRYTALE LIFE. Nixon: OH, I GET OUT. I MEAN, SHE'S SO EXCITED, YOU KNOW? SHE'S BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS, WAITING FOR ME TO COME HOME. OH, SHE WAS HAPPY. I SAID, "GIRL, GET IN THE CAR BEFORE THESE PEOPLE SAY THEY MADE A MISTAKE." Narrator: IT'S THE EMOTIONAL END OF A LONG AND PAINFUL ORDEAL. JAMES MOVES INTO JAMEELAH'S APARTMENT NEAR THE LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THEY GREW UP. THEY ARE FINALLY LIVING TOGETHER AS HUSBAND AND WIFE. Jones: MY MAN WAS HOME. I WAS BEING LOVED. I WAS BEING CARED FOR. I WAS BEING SUPPORTED. WE WERE FINALLY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. I WAS HAPPY. Narrator: BUT JAMES IS FINDING IT A LOT HARDER TO ADJUST TO LIFE OUTSIDE OF PRISON AND THE ROLE OF BEING A HUSBAND. I'M IN SHOCK. THIS IS A TOTAL SHOCK FOR ME. EVERYTHING IS MOVING FAST. BASICALLY, I GOT TO CATCH UP TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT. IT'S A FRESH START FOR THE BOTH OF US. YEAH. MM-HMM. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: WITHIN JUST A FEW MONTHS, ACCORDING TO JAMEELAH, SHE DISCOVERS THAT JAMES IS NOT THE SENSITIVE AND CARING MAN HE ONCE WAS, AND HIS HARSH WORDS ARE ONLY THE BEGINNING. LOOK, I KNOW I NEED A JOB! DON'T EVEN TELL ME I NEED NO JOB! PRISON TOOK AWAY HIS JOY. OHH, IT'S LIKE THAT? PRISON TOOK AWAY HIS IDENTITY. PRISON TOOK AWAY HIS SOUL. PRISON TOOK AWAY HALF OF HIS **** MIND. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE TIRED OF! OH! COURT IS ADJOURNED. Narrator: NOVEMBER 2009. AFTER SPENDING THEIR ENTIRE MARRIAGE APART, JAMEELAH JONES AND HER HUSBAND, JAMES, ARE FINALLY REUNITED NOW THAT HE'S BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON. IT SHOULD BE THE HAPPIEST TIME OF THEIR LIVES, BUT THIS WIFE SOON REALIZES SHE'S PLAYING HOUSE WITH A MAN WHO'S GOT SOME SERIOUS DEMONS. SHUT UP, AND GET OUT OF MY FACE! WHEN THAT MAN CAME BACK HOME TO ME, THAT MAN WAS TORN AND THAT MAN WAS BROKEN. AND HE WENT FROM BEING A LOVING, COOL, LAID-BACK - HE WAS A GREAT GUY. BUT ONCE HE CAME HOME FROM PRISON, HE GOT MEAN. JAMES? HEY, WHAT THE HELL?! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?! THE HELL YOU DOING?! I WAS JUST TRYING TO WAKE YOU UP. Narrator: JAMES' OUTBURSTS CATCH JAMEELAH COMPLETELY OFF GUARD. I WASN'T SNEAKING UP ON YOU. Nixon: PRISON DID SOMETHING TO ME. IT'S JUST CONCENTRATED TENSION AND HATE. THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET YOURSELF HURT! EVERY DAY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE YOUR LAST DAY IN THERE. IT'S VERY NERVE-RACKING. I CAME HOME, I WAS CONDITIONED. JAMES, YOU IS TRIPPING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M TRIPPING?! I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE HARD. I WAS WILLING TO PUT IN THE WORK. BUT WHEN HE GOT HOME, THERE WAS NO COMPASSION. THERE WAS REALLY NO LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING. EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT ME, ME, ME, ME. DAMN! CONGRATULATIONS. WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD. OH, REALLY? THANKS, MAN. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY, MAN. Narrator: JAMES CLAIMS THAT HE DOES HIS BEST TO OVERCOME HIS DEMONS AND GET BACK ON HIS FEET. Nixon: I WANTED TO SHOW HER THAT, "YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION." I WENT OUT ON MY OWN. I GOT A JOB AS A FITNESS INSTRUCTOR. SHE WAS HAPPY FOR A MINUTE. THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET OFF MY BACK? I HAVE A JOB. NO. NO. YOU NEED TO GET YOU A REAL JOB, JAMES. AND THEN IT BECAME, "OH, THAT AIN'T **** YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING 'CAUSE YOU GOT A JOB?" SO, THEN THAT BECAME AN ISSUE. I WENT AND GOT ANOTHER JOB. NOW I GOT TWO JOBS. I'M WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. YOU THINK I'M IMPRESSED 'CAUSE YOU GOT TWO JOBS NOW? "OH, THAT AIN'T NOTHING. THAT AIN'T **** YOU AIN'T REALLY MAKING NO MONEY." I'M NOT GONNA OWN A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY COMING OUT OF PRISON. I DON'T THINK YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. SO, THEN I GOT INTO COLLEGE. IT WAS JUST NEVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER. JAMEELAH IS VERY VERBALLY ABUSIVE, AND SHE KNOWS I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO WORDS. I NEED SOMETHING BETTER, 'CAUSE THIS IS NOT THE LIFE YOU PROMISED ME. BUT YOU KNOW HOW TO PUSH HIS BUTTONS? MM-HMM. WHAT SORT OF THINGS WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM? YOU BUM-ASS **** YOU AIN'T **** I CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT I GOT RIGHT HERE! YOU AIN'T GOT NO MONEY. YOU AIN'T GOT NO CAREER. YOU CAN'T DO A **** THING FOR ME. BROKE-ASS FOOL! AND SHE JUST KEPT REPEATEDLY HURTING ME, HURTING ME, HURTING ME, HURTING ME. SO TIRED OF ARGUING WITH YOU! DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON ME, WOMAN! NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. Narrator: THE TENSION BETWEEN JAMEELAH AND JAMES IS GETTING WORSE WITH EVERY PASSING DAY, AND THINGS ARE STARTING TO GET PHYSICAL. ALL YOU DO IS TALK! OH! THE FIRST TIME THAT MAN HAS STILL KNOCKED ME IN MY FACE, AND I HAD TO RUN OUT MY OWN HOUSE BLOODY. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I TURNED INTO MY MOTHER. [ CRYING ] I ACCEPTED IT. I MADE EXCUSES FOR IT. SO, YOU START JUSTIFYING THE ACTIONS. KEEPS YOU STICKING AROUND. Narrator: BUT JAMES' VERSION OF EVENTS ISN'T QUITE THE SAME. SO TIRED OF THIS **** DON'T **** TURN YOUR BACK ON ME! I DON'T THINK SO, OKAY?! WHAT?! WHAT?! FIRST TIME I EVER PHYSICALLY PUT MY HANDS ON MEEMEE, WE WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH, AND SHE'S JUST DIGGING INTO ME. THAT'S WHY YOUR MAMA KILLED HERSELF, 'CAUSE SHE COULDN'T STAND YOUR PUNK ASS! SHE FOUGHT WITH HER WORDS. ALL I KNOW IS PHYSICAL. I GRABBED HER BY THE MOUTH. I GRABBED HER SO HARD THAT I BUSTED HER LIP. OH, SHE GOES OFF, SHE LEAVES. GET OUT OF MY FACE! [ CRYING ] [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] Jones: SPENT THE NIGHT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND, CAME HOME THE NEXT DAY, AND LIKE MOST WOMEN AT THE BEGINNING STAGES OF ABUSE, YOU LET THEM APOLOGIZE, BUY YOU SOME ROSES, LAY THAT MAGIC STICK DOWN ON YOU, AND EVERYTHING IS BETTER AGAIN. AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING STAGES OF IT. HE'S, LIKE, SEVEN FEET TALL. AND SHE'S A MUNCHKIN. THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR HIM TO PUT HIS HANDS ON HER. JAMEELAH'S EXPECTATIONS FOR JAMES ARE SIMPLY NOT REALITY-BASED WITH HIS STATUS AS A FELON. WHEN SHE ATTACKS HIM VERBALLY, SHE THINKS SHE MIGHT BE MOTIVATING HIM. BUT WHAT SHE'S REALLY DOING IS PROVOKING HIM. AND THIS CIRCLE, THIS DANCE, IS A CYCLE THAT HAS GOT TO BE BROKEN. [ BOTH GRUNTING ] Narrator: REGARDLESS OF WHO IS THE AGGRESSOR, JAMES AND JAMEELAH'S FIGHTS KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER. Jones: NOW I'M KNUCKLING UP WITH YOU. YOU WANT TO FIGHT, ****? LET'S FIGHT. Nixon: WE GET MORE PHYSICAL NOW - VASES. I'M GETTING BEAT WITH A BROOM. SCRATCHED ME UP WITH A FINGERNAIL FILE. I'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT ONE. WHAT IS YOU DOING?! BUT IT'S NOT UNTIL YOU MAKE THE CHOICE TO LEAVE. CAN'T NOBODY TELL YOU TO DO IT. YOU GOT TO DO IT. Narrator: AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR OF CONSTANT BATTLES, JAMES BEGINS TO DRIFT AWAY. AND PRETTY SOON, HE'S STEPPING OUT ON THE MARRIAGE. HEY. HOW YOU DOING? MY NAME'S JAMES. THIS IS WHERE I START PHILANDERING AROUND AND BEING WITH OTHER WOMEN. IT WAS A BIG SHOT TO MY EGO, TOO, BECAUSE AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED, I'M REALLY NOT WORTH MUCH OF NOTHING. BUT TO ANOTHER GIRL, "YOU GOT TWO JOBS? YOU'RE IN SCHOOL? OH, WOW! YOU'RE A GOOD CATCH." WOULD YOU MIND WORKING OUT WITH ME? I'LL SPOT YOU. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT JAMES LOOKS FOR LOVE ON THE SIDE. MANY PEOPLE USE AFFAIRS AS A STEPPING STONE FOR GETTING OUT OF A RELATIONSHIP. BUT HE HAS TO BE CONCERNED WITH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF JAMEELAH FINDS OUT. HEY, BABY. HEY. Narrator: BUT JAMEELAH SENSES JAMES IS KEEPING SOMETHING FROM HER. SHE BEGINS SNOOPING IN HER HUSBAND'S PHONE AND E-MAIL. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] Dr. Jordan: I KNOW YOU STARTED SNOOPING. OH, UNAPOLOGETICALLY. JAMES, CAN YOU COME IN HERE? WHEN YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT THE AFFAIRS? GIRL, THAT HURT LIKE HELL. WHO YOU BEEN TEXTING? WHY YOU GOING THROUGH MY PHONE? WHY ARE YOU PUTTING UP WITH IT? EGO COMES INTO PLAY. "I DONE DID 10 YEARS WITH YOU. "I DONE BEEN THROUGH ALL OF THIS STRUGGLE. "YOU DONE HAD ALL THESE UPS AND DOWNS, AND NOW YOU'RE HOME, AND I'M NOT GONNA LET THE NEXT BITCH WIN." YOU'RE LETTING JAMES OFF THE HOOK. HE HAD THAT KIND OF CONTROL OVER MY HEART. I LOVED THAT MAN, GIRL, FROM THE TOP OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLES OF HIS FEET. I LOVED WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP REPRESENTED. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? EXCUSE ME. JAMEELAH FORGIVES JAMES, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S OKAY WITH HIM CHEATING ON HER. HE'S MY - MY BOYFRIEND. HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND? YEAH. WELL, I'M HIS WIFE. WIFE?! HEY. OH! Narrator: NOVEMBER, 2010, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND. THE MARRIAGE OF 32-YEAR-OLD PARALEGAL JAMEELAH JONES AND HER HUSBAND, JAMES, IS CAREENING TOWARDS DISASTER. BROKE-ASS FOOL! DESPITE THE BITTER BATTLING AND CHEATING, JAMEELAH'S PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SAVE THE RELATIONSHIP. HUSBAND?! WE DON'T DATE OTHER PEOPLE'S HUSBANDS. JAMEELAH LAYS DOWN THE LAW. STAY THE **** AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND, OR THERE WILL BE A PROBLEM. I WAS ONE OF THOSE. I WOULD CONFRONT THE WOMEN, MAKE SURE THE AFFAIR WAS OVER, AND MOVE ON. YOU'LL WANT TO FIND YOUR OWN MAN. Dr. Jordan: JAMEELAH KNOWS THAT JAMES IS NOT GOING TO BE SEXUALLY FAITHFUL TO HER. SHE SEES HIM AS KIND OF A DOG THAT'S GONNA WANDER AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SHE CAN TOLERATE THAT AS LONG AS HE COMES HOME TO HIS MASTER, AND THAT'S JAMEELAH, EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. Narrator: THEN, ONE DAY, SHE UNCOVERS A CRUSHING SECRET JAMES HAS BEEN HIDING. Jones: JAMES WAS A SLOPPY CHEATER, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE STARTED THAT INTERNET. HE WOULD CARRY ON THESE INTERNET LIAISONS ON MY DAMN PHONE. I'M AT WORK, I CLICK ON MY BROWSER, AND THIS WHOLE DAMN CONVERSATION POPS UP. THIS DATING WEBSITE. YOU SEE THE PICTURES BACK AND FORTH - YOU KNOW, PROVOCATIVE PICTURES. Narrator: JAMES SEEMS INFATUATED WITH A WOMAN WHO'S JUST MOVED TO BALTIMORE FROM SPAIN. GIRL, MY HUSBAND WAS GIVING HIS UNDYING LOVE FOR THIS WOMAN. HE TELLING HER, "BABY, JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME. "I PROMISE YOU I CAN BE THE MAN THAT YOU WANT ME TO BE. I JUST GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THIS SITUATION WITH HER." WITH HER? HER IS THE **** WIFE! JAMEELAH IS ENRAGED. THIS AFFAIR ISN'T JUST ABOUT SEX. AFTER MORE THAN 15 YEARS TOGETHER, JAMES SEEMS READY TO THROW IT ALL AWAY FOR A WOMAN HE'S JUST MET. IT'S A BETRAYAL SHE CAN'T ACCEPT. SHE IMMEDIATELY CONFRONTS JAMES. JAMES, WHO THE HELL IS SEÃ‘ORITA ROSE?! Nixon: SHE'S GOING OFF. SHE'S FOAMING AT THE MOUTH. SO, I'M LIKE, "LISTEN, I GOT TO GO TO WORK." SO, SHE'S IN FRONT OF THE DOOR, TRYING TO KEEP ME FROM THE DOOR. I HAVE TO GOT TO WORK. [ CLOTH RIPS ] NOW SHE DONE RIPPED MY SHIRT OFF, CHEST NAKED. I SAID, "I AIN'T HEARD YOU SAY NOTHING LIKE THAT TO ME "IN DAMN NEAR TWO YEARS. BUT YOU'RE SAYING THIS TO THIS WOMAN ON THIS INTERNET." I ASKED, "DO YOU LOVE HER?" HE SAID, "I DON'T LOVE HER." HE SAID, "BUT I LIKE HER." YOU LIKE HER? YES. AND YOU SAID... "GET YOUR **** AND GET THE **** OUT MY HOUSE." Narrator: THE MAN SHE DEVOTED NEARLY HER ENTIRE ADULT LIFE TO IS GONE. HE WAS READY TO REPLACE ME. HE HAD EMOTIONS FOR HER. I HAD TO ACCEPT THAT. YOU BROKE UP WITH JAMES! IT FELT GOOD? IT DID. Dr. Jordan: THIS IS THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL. HE EITHER LOVES HER 100% OR NOT AT ALL. AND THIS SENSE OF BETRAYAL GIVES HER THE STRENGTH TO KICK HIM OUT. Narrator: THREE FULL WEEKS PASS. JAMEELAH AND JAMES HAVE HAD ZERO CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER, AND JAMEELAH IS COMPLETELY HEARTBROKEN. BUT SOMETHING CAME ALONG TO CHANGE THE SITUATION? GIRL, I THOUGHT I HAD A BLADDER INFECTION. [ LAUGHS ] I KEPT GOING TO THE BATHROOM. I WAS GETTING SOME SLIGHT PAIN. JAMEELAH GETS SOME STARTLING NEWS. I SAID, "WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON?" HE SAID, "YOU'RE PREGNANT." AND THIS WAS ACCIDENTAL? YEAH, IT WAS. IT REALLY WASN'T PLANNED. I MEAN, I'D ALWAYS WANTED A BABY, BUT IT WAS A SHOCK. JAMEELAH RELUCTANTLY CALLS JAMES TO GAUGE HIS REACTION. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] HELLO? LOOK, I JUST GOT SOME NEWS. Nixon: I'M GOING TO WORK. SHE CALLED ME. SHE'S LIKE, "I'M PREGNANT." I'M LIKE, "GET OUT OF HERE." 'CAUSE WE WERE BROKEN UP. WE WEREN'T TOGETHER. WE WEREN'T LIVING TOGETHER, ANYTHING. I DIDN'T CARE. I'M A SUCKER FOR HER. THAT'S GREAT! YEAH, MAYBE WE'LL BE A FAMILY NOW. THIS WAS OUR FIRST CHILD - HIS FIRST CHILD, MY FIRST CHILD. SO, HE WAS HAPPY. WE DIDN'T PLAN ON THE BABY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT WE DID PLAN ON HAVING CHILDREN. WHY DON'T YOU COME AND MEET ME? Narrator: JAMEELAH DECIDES TO GIVE THINGS WITH JAMES ONE LAST TRY. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS GONNA BE OKAY. I REALLY DID. I THOUGHT THAT, "WE'RE GONNA WORK THESE ISSUES OUT, AND WE'RE GONNA BE A FAMILY." AND I REALLY THOUGHT THAT. AUNTIE, I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO TELL YOU. GOOD NEWS? I'M READY. ME AND JAMES ARE HAVING A BABY. THE NEXT THING WE KNOW, SHE WAS PREGNANT FROM HIM. [ SIGHS ] I'M LIKE, "OKAY, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LEAVE HIM, "'CAUSE HE'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER. "YOU ALREADY KNOW HE NEEDS ANGER MANAGEMENT. HIS PAROLE OFFICER TOLD YOU THAT." AND SHE WANTED IT TO WORK. SHE WANTED HER CHILD TO HAVE A MOTHER AND FATHER. WHY WOULD YOU BRING A BABY INTO THIS WORLD WITH A MAN THAT BEATS YOU? I TRIED TO BEAT IT IN HER HEAD. I TOLD HER THERE WAS ONLY SO MUCH I COULD DO OR SAY TO HER, AND THEN SHE KIND OF SHUT DOWN, NOT ANSWERING THE PHONES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THERE WAS TIMES IN MY LIFE WHERE I DIDN'T SPEAK TO MY AUNT 'CAUSE I WAS ASHAMED BY SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT I WAS MAKING. Narrator: THE COUPLE TRIES HARD TO MAKE THEIR MARRIAGE WORK, AND FOR A WHILE, IT FEELS LIKE THE SPARK THAT BLEW OUT IS BACK. HOW WAS HE TREATING YOU? IT WAS OKAY... UNTIL I WAS ABOUT SIX MONTHS' PREGNANT, AND I FOUND OUT HE WAS HAVING ANOTHER AFFAIR. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] HELLO? WHO IS THIS? YOU'RE LOOKING FO- THIS IS HIS WIFE. [ Phone clicks, dial tone ] HELLO?! I CONFRONTED HIM THAT TIME, AND HE CRIED. AND, YOU KNOW, AFTER A WHILE, IT IS THE SAME SONG BEING PLAYED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. NO, SERIOUSLY, SOME WOMAN JUST CALLED MY PHONE LOOKING FOR YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHO SHAQUITA IS. Jones: LET'S NOT BE CONFUSED HERE. I NEVER PLAYED STUPID. I'M NEVER NAIVE. I KNEW THAT THAT MAN WAS GONNA CHEAT ON ME. LOOK AT WHERE HE HAD JUST COME FROM. BUT HE JUST COMPLETELY DISRESPECTED ME. HE HAD NO CONCERN FOR THE FACT THAT I'M EVEN A WIFE. GET BACK HERE! JAMES AND JAMEELAH'S BRITTLE RELATIONSHIP BEGINS TO CRACK ONCE AGAIN. SHE WON'T LET ME LEAVE, THEN I FIGHT BACK. SO, THEN, HERE WE ARE AGAIN. [ BOTH GRUNTING ] Jones: WHILE I WAS PREGNANT, HE WASN'T AS ABUSIVE, BUT WE HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE I WAS PUSHED UP AGAINST A WALL, AND THERE WAS NO COMING BACK FROM THAT DARK PLACE AFTER THAT. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] IT WAS ALWAYS A SITUATION WHERE I WANTED THE PAIN TO STOP. Dr. Jordan: SHE WANTS HIM IN HER LIFE TO BE THE FATHER OF THEIR CHILD, AND YET, AT THE SAME TIME, SHE KNOWS HOW TO PROVOKE HIM AND PUSH HIS BUTTONS. HE KNOWS HE NEEDS TO WALK AWAY WHEN SHE DOES THIS, BUT HOW CAN HE WHEN SHE'S ALSO PULLING HIM BACK TO CREATE A FAMILY? THIS CYCLONE OF EMOTION REALLY IS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL. Narrator: IN THE SUMMER OF 2011, JAMEELAH AND JAMES' SON IS BORN. SUDDENLY, JAMEELAH'S WHOLE PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE SHIFTS. AFTER THAT BABY WAS BORN, GIRL... MNH, MNH, MNH. IT CHANGED MY WHOLE LIFE. IT REALLY DID. MOMMY'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU. WITH A NEW BABY IN HER LIFE, JAMEELAH'S TOLERANCE IS NOW AT ZERO. THERE WILL BE NO MORE ABUSE. THERE WILL BE NO MORE JAMEELAH SACRIFICING HERSELF FOR JAMES. THERE WILL BE NO MORE OVERLOOKING OR JUSTIFYING OF ANYTHING. NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH REALITY. DID YOU THINK THE BABY MIGHT CHANGE HIM? NO. DON'T NO BABY CHANGE NO MAN. THAT'S ONE THING I ALWAYS KNEW. COMING UP... THIS VOLATILE COUPLE EXPLODES IN ONE FINAL CONFRONTATION. WHAT YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT KNIFE? YOU BETTER PUT THAT KNIFE DOWN. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS! I HAVE TO GO TO WORK! Narrator: JAMEELAH JONES' MARRIAGE TO HER HUSBAND, JAMES, IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE AFTER TWO YEARS OF PHYSICAL AND VERBAL ABUSE. THEIR ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR NEW BABY HAVE ONLY MADE THINGS MORE TOXIC. ONE AUTUMN DAY WHILE THE BABY IS AT A RELATIVE'S HOUSE, JAMES RETURNS FROM WORK AND AN ARGUMENT QUICKLY ERUPTS. WOMAN, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? JAMES, IT'S BEEN TWO HOURS! ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?! I'VE BEEN AT WORK! I WALK IN THE HOUSE, AND WE JUST START GOING BACK AND FORTH. THEN SHE SAYS SOMETHING SLICK, AND I HATED WHEN SHE CURSED AT ME. HER MOUTH IS JUST CRAZY. SHE'S GOT A SAILOR'S MOUTH. I'M SICK OF YOU, WOMAN. I'M SICK OF YOUR MOUTH. EVERY TIME I COME HOME, I GOT TO PUT UP WITH THIS. I'M SICK OF YOU! I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE SICK OF! JAMES, ON THAT DAY, HE JUST WAS BEING ANTAGONISTIC. JAMES ON THAT DAY WAS JUST PICKING AND JUST KEPT PICKING AND BEING DISRESPECTFUL. HOW ABOUT YOU FIX SOME OF THIS FOOD RIGHT HERE? IT'S JUST SITTING HERE. HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE IT AND FIX SOME OF THIS FOOD, HUH?! HOW ABOUT I JUST COME OVER THERE AND SMACK YOU MYSELF?! AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF PLAYING THIS SAME SCENARIO OUT, YOU KNOW WHEN THAT BLOW ABOUT TO COME. CHOP! CHOP! TURN AROUND WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU! THEN ALL THESE IMAGES START PLAYING IN MY HEAD OF ALL THE **** THAT I HAD WENT THROUGH AND EVERYTHING FROM THE WOMEN TO THE CHEATING TO THE ABUSE, IT JUST ALL STARTED PLAYING IN MY HEAD. Narrator: JAMEELAH HAS FINALLY REACHED HER BREAKING POINT. LOOK AT ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU, AND I'M TALKING TO YOU! TURN AROUND WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU! EVERYTHING SHE SACRIFICED TO HOLD THIS MARRIAGE TOGETHER HAS ALL BEEN IN VAIN. WHAT YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT KNIFE? YOU BETTER PUT THAT KNIFE DOWN. I DIDN'T REALLY THINK SHE WOULD STAB ME. I'M LIKE, WHATEVER. Narrator: THEN JAMEELAH LOSES ALL CONTROL. I **** SNAPPED. THOSE FEW MINUTES, CASEY, I LOST MY **** MIND. HEY, LOOK! NO MORE! AAH! AND THE FIRST TIME I CAUGHT JAMES, I CAUGHT HIM, LIKE, IN THE LOWER ABDOMEN AREA. AND HE WAS KIND OF SHOCKED, SO HE BACKED UP. YOU CRAZY BITCH. I'M, YOU KNOW, "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU STABBED ME!" WOMAN, YOU STABBED ME! Jones: I SAID, "I'M ABOUT TO DO IT AGAIN!" GIRL, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE. YOU LOST YOUR MIND. YOU LOST YOUR DAMN MIND. HE WAS SHOCKED, BUT I DIDN'T LET UP. I CUT HIS ASS AGAIN. NO! THIS BITCH CRAZY! THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH MY HEAD. Jones: AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE TABLES HAD TURNED, AND I WAS NO LONGER THE VICTIM. 'CAUSE NOW I REALIZED I GOT TOTAL CONTROL OF THIS WHOLE **** SITUATION. Narrator: JAMES TRIES TO ESCAPE JAMEELAH'S WRATH. I KNEW IF I WOULD HAVE GRABBED THAT, I WOULD HAVE HURT HER. SO, I JUST OPENED THE DOOR, AND I GO OUT THE DOOR. I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL. GET AWAY FROM ME, WOMAN! GET AWAY FROM ME, WOMAN! YOU'RE CRAZY! GET AWAY FROM ME! Narrator: A WOUNDED AND BLOODY JAMES FLAGS DOWN A TAXI. YOU HURT ME? YOU BEEN HURTING ME! Nixon: WE'RE STILL ARGUING. I GET IN THE CAB, AND SHE'S LIKE, "I'M GONNA KILL YOU! I HOPE YOU DIE!" I HOPE YOU DIE! MY MIND CAME BACK TO ME. AND I SNAPPED BACK. AND MYSELF SAID, "GIRL, GO BACK UPSTAIRS." AND I WENT BACK UPSTAIRS. I CLEANED OFF MY KNIFE. THERE'S BLOOD ALL OVER? HONEY, THERE WAS BLOOD ALL OVER THAT KNIFE. I CLEANED IT UP, HONEY. SURE DID. I CLEANED IT UP AND PUT IT BACK IN MY DRAWER, HAD ME SOME CIGARETTES AND A BOTTLE OF PINOT GRIGIO AND BASKED IN MY MOMENT OF GLORY. WERE YOU FREAKED OUT THAT HE WAS GONNA TELL THE POLICE? GIRL, AT THAT POINT, I DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN. I DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN. AT THAT POINT IN TIME, I WOULD HAVE WENT WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE. TO PRISON? TO PRISON. YOU FELT EMANCIPATED? GIRL, I FELT FREE. FREER THAN THE HARRIET TUBMAN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. I CAN FEEL THE GOOSE BUMPS AS THEY GO UP MY ARMS RIGHT NOW, THAT'S HOW FREE I FELT. GIRL, YOU MAY HAVE LOST A WHOLE LOT OF BATTLES, BUT YOU WON THAT DAMN WAR. AT THE HOSPITAL, JAMES IS TREATED FOR MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS. HE REFUSES TO SAY WHO ATTACKED HIM OR TAKE ANY KIND OF LEGAL ACTION. I DON'T KNOW NOTHING. I'M NOT SENDING HER TO JAIL. MY SON IS 3 MONTHS. NO. IF YOU COULD GIVE US ANY TYPE OF - LOOK, MAN. I TOLD YOU. I DIDN'T SEE NOBODY, ALL RIGHT? Narrator: HOURS LATER, JAMES GETS A SURPRISE VISITOR. I WENT TO GO VISIT HIM IN THE HOSPITAL. HE WAS HURT. HE WAS HURT. I WALKED IN AND SAID, "HEY, HOW YOU FEELING? HOW YOU DOING?" HE SAID, "WHAT THE **** ARE YOU DOING HERE?" [ LAUGHS ] I SAID, I CAME TO SEE ABOUT YOU, MAKE SURE YOUR ASS IS ALIVE. Narrator: LUCKILY, JAMES' INJURIES AREN'T SERIOUS. THINGS GOT REALLY OUT OF HAND. I KNOW THAT. AND I DID APOLOGIZE. I APOLOGIZED FOR ATTACKING HIM LIKE THAT. I DID. IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE CAN'T DO THIS NO MORE, THOUGH. Narrator: LATER THAT EVENING, JAMEELAH DRIVES JAMES HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL. WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS, YOU KNOW? THE VOLATILE COUPLE HAS BEEN TOGETHER THEIR ENTIRE ADULT LIVES, AND BOTH OF THEM FINALLY ADMIT IT'S TIME TO PART WAYS. LET'S JUST DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE CHILD, OKAY? WE'RE IN THE CAR, AND I'M LIKE, "I HAVE TO LET YOU GO." AND I CRIED. WE BOTH CRIED. I'M LIKE, "I CAN'T DO IT NO MORE. I GOT TO LET YOU GO FOR MY OWN EMOTIONAL WELLBEING. I'M GONNA GO BACK TO JAIL, OR I'M GONNA HURT YOU, AND THAT'S GONNA KILL ME, OR YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME, AND THAT'S GONNA KILL YOU. WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS. WE GOT A BABY NOW. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE JAMEELAH, AND I ALWAYS TOLD HER, "ALTHOUGH I CANNOT BE THERE FOR YOU AS YOUR HUSBAND RIGHT NOW, I'LL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND." I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE NEVER TOUCHED YOU. HE APOLOGIZED, TOO, AND FINALLY, HE OWNED UP TO WHAT HE DID. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT FELT SO GOOD. I THINK IT DID, BABY. I THINK IT DID. END UP KILLING ME. Jones: I'M NOT CRAZY. I WASN'T AN ALCOHOLIC. I WASN'T ANY OF THOSE THINGS. I WAS A WOMAN WITH A BROKEN HEART TRYING TO MEND HER OWN WOUNDS. WHEN JAMEELAH PICKS UP THAT KNIFE AND ATTACKS JAMES, IT'S NOT OUT OF A SENSE OF HATRED. SHE SIMPLY WANTS TO STOP THE ABUSE AND SAY, "I AM NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE." NO MORE! AND WHEN SHE DOES THAT, AMAZINGLY, IT CLEARS THE AIR. ONCE JAMES UNDERSTANDS JAMEELAH'S BOUNDARIES, THERE'S A SENSE OF RESPECT, EVEN LOVE, THAT'S GOING TO SURVIVE. Narrator: TODAY, JAMEELAH AND JAMES REMAIN SEPARATED FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR SON. THEIR LONG BATTLE OF WILLS HAS FINALLY ENDED IN A TRUCE. I HAVE TO SAY, CASEY, SINCE THAT DAY, THAT MAN AIN'T NEVER PUT HIS HANDS ON ME LIKE THAT. THAT MAN HAS NEVER INSULTED ME, DISRESPECTED ME, WAS MEAN TO ME. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CIVIL CO-PARENTING RELATIONSHIP. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
