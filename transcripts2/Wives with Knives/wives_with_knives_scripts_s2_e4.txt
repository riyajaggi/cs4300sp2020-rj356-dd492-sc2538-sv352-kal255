 AND THEN ON DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, THAT'S JUST DISASTROUS. I'M NOT - AAH! [ SCREAMS ] Narrator: NOT ALL FAIRYTALES HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS. WHEN LOVE GOES WRONG, A WOMAN CAN DO THE UNTHINKABLE. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS JUNE 2008. ON A HOT SUMMER DAY IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, IT'S HARD NOT TO NOTICE 23-YEAR-OLD ANNETTE HERNANDEZ, A STRIKING BEAUTY WHO TURNS HEADS EVERYWHERE SHE GOES. MEN ARE INSTANTLY DRAWN TO HER, INCLUDING HER NEIGHBOR CAMERON PATTERSON. Patterson: I STILL REMEMBER THE MOMENT I SAW HER. SHE WAS WALKING, AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST LIKE,

 "WOW, THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN." SHE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE THAT RED, RED LIPSTICK. AND ONE DAY, I WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA GO SAY HEY TO HER." HI. Narrator: ANNETTE RARELY GIVES MEN THE TIME OF DAY. AND HE JUST - HE TOOK INTEREST IN ME, AND WE HUNG OUT - ME, HIM, AND MY COUSIN. Narrator: CAMERON IS HOOKED RIGHT AWAY. ANNETTE DOESN'T SEE HIM AS ANYTHING MORE THAN A POSSIBLE FLING. ENJOYING THE SUN? I REMEMBER NOT HAVING A WHOLE LOT OF INTEREST. ARIZONA. I JUST FELT LIKE WE REALLY HAD A CONNECTION. [ LAUGHS ] I'M A COOK. OH, YOU'RE A COOK? YEAH. HE WANTED SOMETHING SERIOUS, AND I DIDN'T. Patterson: I COULD OPEN UP AND TALK TO HER. IT WAS LIKE THE WHOLE KINDRED-SPIRIT-TYPE THING, WHERE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH SOMEBODY. OH, THANK YOU. Narrator: CAMERON THINKS HE'S SCORED WITH THIS BRUNET BEAUTY... BUT ONCE ANNETTE'S DEEP-SEATED ISSUES FLOAT TO THE SURFACE, CAMERON WILL FIND HIMSELF DIRECTLY IN HARM'S WAY. [ CHUCKLES ] EVER SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL, ANNETTE HAS ALWAYS FELT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CHILDREN. I REMEMBER KIND OF SITTING AWAY FROM THE OTHER KIDS, JUST REALLY NOT FEELING RIGHT. Angie: SHE WAS KIND OF A LONER. RATHER THAN TO GO OUT AND PLAY, SHE'D STAY IN HER ROOM. SHE PLAYED WITH HER TOYS OR WATCHED A LITTLE TELEVISION. SHE COULD DO THAT FOR HOURS. SHE HAD MOOD SWINGS - FROM HAPPY-GO-LUCKY, JUST REALLY SWEET AND CHEERFUL, AND THEN SHE'D CHANGE TO KIND OF QUIET AND DARK, WITHDRAWN. Narrator: ANNETTE'S PARENTS AREN'T TOO WORRIED ABOUT THEIR DAUGHTER'S STRANGE BEHAVIOR AT FIRST AND FIGURE IT'S JUST A PHASE. SHE WAS LOVING, FUNNY, SWEET. SHE WAS A SWEET LITTLE GIRL. Narrator: HER PARENTS HAVE NO CLUE THAT THEIR LITTLE GIRL IS BATTLING SOME SERIOUS MENTAL DEMONS. Annette: I WOULD KIND OF SEE THINGS THAT WEREN'T THERE, THAT OTHER KIDS COULDN'T SEE, LIKE SHADOWS. THEY SEEMED TO BE EVIL. I COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. I'D HEAR, LIKE, AN OLD-FASHIONED RADIO, KIND OF STATIC. I WOULD HEAR MY NAME BEING CALLED. Narrator: DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. THERE COULD BE SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS FOR ANNETTE'S UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR AS A CHILD. MAYBE SHE SIMPLY IS PRONE TO FANTASY OR HAS AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION. PARENTS WANT TO CHALK THIS UP TO THE UNIQUENESS OF THEIR CHILD AND NOT IMAGINE THAT THERE COULD BE SOMETHING SEVERELY, ORGANICALLY WRONG. Narrator: ANNETTE NEVER TELLS ANYONE ABOUT THE HALLUCINATIONS. THEN ONE DAY, AT THE AGE OF 12, SHE DECIDES SHE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. ANNETTE GETS HER HANDS ON A BOTTLE OF MUSCLE RELAXANTS. Annette: I TOOK ALL OF THEM. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER HOW MANY THERE WERE. AND I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT. I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D GO TO SLEEP AND WOULDN'T WAKE UP AGAIN. ARE YOU SAYING YOU WERE TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF? YES. AT 12? YES. Angie: I JUST REMEMBER THAT I COULD HEAR HER THROWING UP, AND SHE WOULDN'T SAY WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER AT FIRST. NETTIE, WHAT'S THE MATTER? AND THEN, SHE FINALLY TOLD ME - "MOM, I TOOK THESE PILLS. NOW I FEEL REALLY BAD." WHY?! "I'M VERY SCARED. I'M VERY WORRIED. I'M CONFUSED." I'M LIKE, "WHY?" WE TOOK HER RIGHT AWAY TO THE HOSPITAL, WHERE SHE HAD HER STOMACH PUMPED. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: DOCTORS SEND ANNETTE TO A PSYCHOLOGIST FOR AN EVALUATION. THE DIAGNOSIS SURPRISES EVERYONE - PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEVERAL TYPES OF THERAPY WE CAN TRY. THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS WE CAN TRY TO KIND OF MINIMIZE HER SYMPTOMS. Angie: IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE AT FIRST. I'M LIKE, "SCHIZOPHRENIA? MY DAUGHTER?" THE DOCTORS EXPLAINED IT TO US, WE READ ABOUT IT, WE HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS, LIKE, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? AND THEY SAID, "PUT HER ON MEDICINE, GO TO COUNSELING AND THERAPIES," AND WE DID. Dr. Jordan: IT'S VERY RARE THAT PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA IS DIAGNOSED IN CHILDREN. IT USUALLY CAN'T MANIFEST ITSELF UNTIL THE LATE TEENS OR EARLY 20s. THE BIGGEST INDICATORS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA ARE HALLUCINATIONS, DELUSIONS, THE SUBJECT MAY HEAR VOICES, SO IT'S AN INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION FOR THE SUBJECT TO EXPERIENCE. Narrator: FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, DOCTORS PRESCRIBE A LAUNDRY LIST OF MEDICATIONS IN HOPES OF TREATING ANNETTE'S ILLNESS. Annette: I'VE GONE THROUGH ABOUT 36 OF THEM - SEROQUEL, ZYPREXA, RISPERDAL, DEPAKOTE, LITHIUM - DIFFERENT ONES. DID ANY OF THEM HELP? NO. I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE MY MEDICATION. WHETHER I WAS ON IT OR NOT, I STILL COULD SEE THESE THINGS, AND I STARTED TO REALIZE, "HEY, THESE THINGS ARE GONNA BE HERE NO MATTER WHAT." Narrator: ANNETTE STRUGGLES WITH HIGH SCHOOL. Annette: I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE AROUND ALL THE KIDS SO MUCH. I HAD A HARD TIME BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE. Narrator: BY THE TIME SHE'S 16, ANNETTE CONVINCES HER PARENTS TO LET HER LEAVE SCHOOL AND GET HER OWN PLACE NEARBY, ON THE CONDITION THAT SHE GET HER G. E. D. BUT SHE'S STILL PLAGUED BY THE SAME HALLUCINATIONS. NOW ON HER OWN, ANNETTE DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER TO ANYONE, AND SHE QUICKLY STARTS DOWN A DANGEROUS PATH WITH THE NEW FRIENDS SHE MEETS AT HER WAITRESSING JOB. I STARTED DOING CRANK, OLD-SCHOOL SPEED. [ SNIFFS ] AND THEN I DID ICE. AND THESE ARE JUST FORMS OF SPEED? YEAH. IN THE SAME FAMILY AS METHAMPHETAMINE? YES. DID IT HELP TO SELF-MEDICATE THE VOICES IN YOUR HEAD? AT THE TIME THAT I DID IT, YEAH. I KIND OF WOULD FORGET ABOUT IT. IT WAS AN ESCAPE FOR ME. I JUST WANTED SOMEBODY TO UNDERSTAND, AND THEY COULDN'T, AND IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING. [ CHUCKLES ] ANNETTE IS IN A DANGEROUS CYCLE OF SELF-MEDICATION THROUGH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. THIS IS GOING TO BRING HER TEMPORARY RELIEF, BUT IN THE END, IT'S NOT A SOLUTION. IT'S GOING TO GET HER INTO TROUBLE. Narrator: WHILE THE DRUGS PROVIDE A QUICK FIX, THEY ALSO MAKE HER HALLUCINATIONS MUCH WORSE. ANNETTE BELIEVES THESE DELUSIONS ARE LINKED TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE SINISTER. Annette: I BELIEVE THAT THE DEVIL COMES IN MANY FORMS, AND A MAJOR ONE IS METH. I FEEL LIKE IT WAS A PORTAL TO THE OTHER SIDE WHEN I DID IT, AND I BELIEVE THE THINGS THAT I HALLUCINATED WHEN I WAS ON IT, THAT THEY WERE REAL. I SEE PUPPETS RUNNING AROUND, MESSING WITH MY DOORKNOB IN THE HOUSE. AND I GO TO SEE IF SOMEBODY WAS MESSING WITH THE DOOR, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, I LOOK UP, AND THERE WAS SOMETHING RUNNING UP AROUND THE LIVING ROOM, AND IT WAS SO REAL. I MEAN, IT WAS SO REAL. Narrator: FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, ANNETTE REFUSES TO TAKE HER MEDICATIONS REGULARLY, AND HER SELF-MEDICATING SPIRALS INTO A LIFE OF ADDICTION, WHICH TRIGGERS A SERIES OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE DOOMED FROM THE START. Annette: EVEN IF I DIDN'T LIKE THE GUY, I'D DATE HIM JUST SO I COULD GET HIGH AND I WOULDN'T HAVE TO BUY IT. Narrator: ANGIE IS CONSTANTLY WORRIED ABOUT HER DAUGHTER, BUT EVERY TIME SHE TRIES TO STEP IN, ANNETTE PUSHES HER AWAY. I TRIED CALLING HER. SHE WOULDN'T ANSWER HER PHONE. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] SHE JUST WANTED TO BE LEFT ALONE. IT WAS FRUSTRATING. SHE WAS SELF-MEDICATING. IF SHE WASN'T ON HER PRESCRIBED MEDICATION, SHE WAS ON STREET DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. I KNEW SHE WASN'T HAPPY. YOU KNOW, YOU ACT AS IF YOU ARE THERE, AND YOU'RE NOT. Narrator: ANNETTE'S FRAGILE MENTAL STATE TAKES ANOTHER HIT WHEN HER PARENTS SPLIT UP AFTER 25 YEARS OF MARRIAGE. I SAW IT COMING. I MEAN, THEY WEREN'T REALLY THAT HAPPY. I REMEMBER MY MOM NOT REALLY WANTING TO BE WITH HIM GROWING UP. I COULD ALWAYS SEE THAT. Narrator: DESPITE HER CHALLENGES, AT THE AGE OF 23, ANNETTE FEELS SHE MAY FINALLY BE READY TO OPEN HERSELF UP TO TRUE LOVE. ANNETTE AND CAMERON QUICKLY GET HOT AND HEAVY AND SEEM TO HAVE A REAL CONNECTION, BUT PART OF THAT STEMS FROM THEIR MUTUAL LOVE OF GETTING HIGH. Annette: WE DID COKE. WE GOT HIGH A LOT. I COULDN'T TAKE US BEING TOGETHER SERIOUSLY. Angie: THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS MOSTLY BASED ON JUST PARTYING WITH ALCOHOL AND METH. I DIDN'T THINK THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS GONNA LAST. Narrator: THE HOT NEW LOVERS SPEND EVERY MOMENT TOGETHER. ANNETTE'S SELF-MEDICATING SEEMS TO KEEP HER MENTAL ILLNESS AT BAY, AND SHE SLOWLY LETS HER GUARD DOWN. IN FACT, SHE STARTS TO DEVELOP REAL FEELINGS FOR CAMERON. WE'D GO PLAY POOL, AND WE'D GO SWIMMING AT THE LAKE, LIKE, AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING, AND WE HAD FUN TOGETHER. WE COULD BE AT THE LAUNDROMAT AND HAVE FUN. HE MADE ME LAUGH. Patterson: WE WERE VERY SPONTANEOUS. WHATEVER CAME UP AND WE FELT LIKE DOING, WE'D JUST GO AND DO IT. I KNEW SHE WAS THE ONE. Narrator: THIS COUPLE SEEMS PERFECT TOGETHER, BUT THEIR RECKLESS LIFESTYLE IS ABOUT TO TURN THIS DRUG-FILLED ROMANCE UPSIDE DOWN. ONE DAY AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS OF DATING, CAMERON AND ANNETTE ARE HANGING OUT BY THE POOL. I WAS REALLY MESSED UP - I HAD TAKEN SOME XANAX, AND I WAS DRINKING WHISKEY AND DOING SOME OTHER STUFF. Narrator: SUDDENLY, THEY GET A SURPRISE VISITOR. IT'S CAMERON'S EX-GIRLFRIEND. WHO THE HELL IS THIS?! SHE STARTED A BIG SCENE. WE NEED TO TALK! ANNETTE WAS REALLY UPSET AT THAT POINT. THIS IS ANNETTE. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? OH! WHO AM I? YEAH. SHE STARTED ATTACKING ME. YES, I HAVE! ARE YOU KIDDING?! Cameron: HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! I THOUGHT, "THIS IS NOT GOOD." Narrator: CAMERON TRIES TO BREAK UP THE CATFIGHT AND GETS CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE. I JUST THOUGHT, "THIS NEEDS TO STOP." I THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO GO FOR HER, I GUESS, SO I WAS MAD. OH, YOU'RE THE HO! WOW. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? Annette: I WENT AND GOT THE JAR OF COFFEE THAT I HAD. YOU'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING TO ME! I'M NOT - AAH! [ SCREAMS ] OH, MY GOD! Narrator: AND SHE'S NOT DONE YET. GOD! Narrator: AUGUST 2008. PHOENIX, ARIZONA. ANNETTE HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER NEIGHBOR CAMERON PATTERSON FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS. BUT WHEN HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND SHOWS UP UNANNOUNCED, ANNETTE FEELS THREATENED, AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Annette: I HAD GOTTEN THE KNIFE... AND I SAID, "HEY, CAMERON, I'M SORRY I DID THAT. I HIT YOU," YOU KNOW, "COME HERE." WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST - SHE WANTED TO TALK TO ME. I WALKED UP TO HER. NEXT THING I KNOW, SHE CAME AROUND. IT'S ALL RIGHT. AAH! SHE STABBED ME. SHE HIT ME IN THE BACK. I ACTUALLY LOOKED AT HER. I WAS LIKE, "REALLY?" YOU KNOW, "YOU STABBED ME?" TO THIS DAY, I STILL DON'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. Narrator: POLICE ARRIVE AT THE SCENE. ANNETTE IS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH ASSAULT. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] DOCTORS SAID THAT, "MAN, YOU WERE LUCKY," 'CAUSE IT CAME RIGHT BETWEEN MY SPLEEN AND MY KIDNEY. Narrator: WHEN QUESTIONED, ANNETTE TELLS POLICE SHE BLACKED OUT DURING THE ATTACK AND HAS NO MEMORY OF WHAT HAPPENED. HER FATHER HIRES A LAWYER AND BAILS HER OUT. IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT ANNETTE HAS NO MEMORY OF STABBING CAMERON. WHEN PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENICS BECOME OVERWHELMED WITH THE HALLUCINATIONS, DELUSIONS, THE VOICES, THEY FLY INTO A PEAK OF RAGE WHERE THEY HAVE NO MEMORY AFTERWARDS OF WHAT THEY DID IN THE MOMENT. Narrator: CAMERON LEAVES TOWN, HOPING TO NEVER LOOK BACK. I JUST WANTED TO GO SOMEWHERE AND START OVER AGAIN, YOU KNOW. Narrator: THE COUPLE'S FLEETING ROMANCE IS OVER. THAT IS, UNTIL ANNETTE GETS SOME STARTLING NEWS. I WENT OVER ONE MORNING, AND I HAD MADE COFFEE, AND SHE JUST STARTING THROWING UP AND THROWING UP. SHE SAID THE SMELL MADE HER GO THROW UP. I SAID, "UH-OH." Annette: I WENT THE MENTAL-HEALTH CLINIC TO TRY TO GET SOME HELP, AND THEY SAID, "WE NEED TO TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST." AND I SAID, "ALL RIGHT, FINE." I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT. AND THEN THEY TOOK IT. THEY SAID, "YOU'RE PREGNANT." AT FIRST, I WAS UPSET. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] Patterson: WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS, I WANTED TO COME BACK. I'M PREGNANT. SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HER SCHIZOPHRENIA. I HAVE A DISORDER. I KNEW THAT WAS A PART OF HER, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT MADE HER WHO SHE WAS, AND WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEBODY, YOU ACCEPT THEM AND YOU LOVE THEM FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY ARE. Narrator: CAMERON DECIDES TO RETURN TO PHOENIX AND MOVE IN WITH ANNETTE. Patterson: I FORGAVE HER FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE. I WANTED TO HAVE A FAMILY WITH HER. I WANT TO BE A PART OF IT. I WANTED TO SHOW HER THAT I COULD BE SOMEBODY THAT SHE COULD DEPEND UPON. Narrator: AT CAMERON'S REQUEST, THE D. A. REDUCES THE ASSAULT CHARGES TO A MISDEMEANOR. ANNETTE GETS PROBATION AND IS ABLE TO FOCUS ON HER PREGNANCY. ANNETTE GOES OFF HER PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS WHILE PREGNANT, AND IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING SHE GIVES UP. AND TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THE PREGNANCY CHANGED YOU. OH, OF COURSE I WASN'T GETTING HIGH. I WAS PREGNANT, AND I WASN'T DRINKING OR ANYTHING. I WAS AFRAID TO EVEN BE AROUND CIGARETTE SMOKE. OKAY, I HAVE TO ASK. LIKE THAT, YOU'RE JUST LIKE, "I'M PREGNANT," AND IT STOPS? YEAH. FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR BABY? YEAH. I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT HER, SO I QUIT. QUIT DOING EVERYTHING. Narrator: ANGIE FEELS LIKE SHE HAS HER DAUGHTER BACK AGAIN. IT WAS LIKE THE PREGNANCY WIPED AWAY HER MENTAL ILLNESS. SHE WAS MY LITTLE GIRL AGAIN, EXCEPT PREGNANT. I KNOW. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. IT SMELLS SO GOOD! Dr. Jordan: PREGNANCY CAN CAUSE A HUGE FLUX IN HORMONES, WHICH ACTUALLY AFFECT BRAIN CHEMISTRY AND SOMEONE'S OVERALL MOOD. WITH ANNETTE, THE EFFECT WAS EXTREMELY POSITIVE. FOR THE FIRST TIME, SHE FEELS CALM AND SECURE, IN CHARGE OF HER LIFE, AND PERHAPS NOW ABLE TO DEAL WITH HER MENTAL ILLNESS. HEY! Narrator: EVEN CAMERON SOBERS UP. HE GETS A JOB AS A COOK AND STARTS PREPARING FOR HIS NEW ROLE AS A FATHER. I WAS BASICALLY PREGNANT, TOO, DURING THE WHOLE THING. [ LAUGHS ] THE REALIZATION THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMEBODY I'M GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOW. GOT CLOTHES AND BIBS AND BABY STUFF. SOMEBODY WHO'S GONNA LOOK UP TO YOU EVERY DAY. GOT A BLANKET. AND YOU REALIZE, "OKAY, MAYBE I NEED TO START MAKING SOME CHANGES." Narrator: TOGETHER, CAMERON AND ANNETTE MEND THEIR DAMAGED RELATIONSHIP.... SMELLS GOOD. ...AND REKINDLE THE ROMANCE. AND THINGS WERE GOING GOOD, AND WE WERE IN LOVE. Narrator: AND ANNETTE IS ABOUT TO GET HER FAIRYTALE ENDING. Patterson: THIS CLEAR SKY OUTSIDE - I TOOK HER OUT IN THE BACKYARD, I GOT DOWN ON MY KNEES AND TOLD HER, "LOOK, I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU." YES! YES? YES, YES! REALLY? SHE SAID YES. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: IN APRIL 2009, CAMERON AND ANNETTE WELCOME A BABY GIRL NAMED ANNA INTO THEIR LIVES. OH, GOD. HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS BORN. Patterson: I LOOKED AT ANNETTE - I STILL REMEMBER THIS - AND WAS LIKE, "SHE CAN DO NO WRONG." [ BABY COOS ] HEY, BEAUTIFUL. I'VE NEVER FELT A LOVE LIKE THAT. IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE. [ BABY CRYING ] Narrator: BUT ADDING A BABY TO THE MIX PUTS AN UNEXPECTED STRAIN ON THE COUPLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN ANNETTE EXPERIENCES A COMMON ILLNESS IN NEW MOTHERS - POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. I WAS JUST REALLY UPSET ABOUT EVERYTHING. I WAS JUST DEPRESSED. Angie: HER POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION WAS REALLY BAD. SHE DIDN'T GET PUT BACK ON MEDICATION RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE SHE HAD DONE SO WELL DURING HER PREGNANCY. AND HER SCHIZOPHRENIA CAME BACK FULL FORCE. Narrator: TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, CAMERON FALLS OFF THE WAGON. I HAD STARTED TO FALTER MYSELF AND USE. YOU KNOW, I THINK SHE KNEW IT, BECAUSE I WOULDN'T COME HOME EXACTLY RIGHT AFTER WORK. WHERE WERE YOU? IT STARTED TO AFFECT HER. I WAS GETTING HIGH AGAIN. YOU WERE GETTING HIGH?! GIVE ME YOUR PHONE! HERE. TAKE THE PHONE. LET ME SEE. LET ME SEE. LOOK AROUND. THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE. YOU'RE GOING NUTS, ALL RIGHT? LOOK - LOOK - LOOK FOR ANYONE. LOOK FOR ANYTHING. CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN! NO, I WILL NOT CALM DOWN! Dr. Jordan: ANNETTE'S SUFFERING FROM SEVERE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. SHE IS NOT TAKING HER MEDICATION. SHE'S BEEN CLEAN, BUT NOW HER PARTNER IS USING AGAIN, AND IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE TEMPTATION FOR HER TO DO IT, AS WELL. IF SHE DOESN'T GET CONTROL OF THIS SITUATION SOON, THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE VERY DANGEROUS. Narrator: ONE NIGHT, JUST FIVE WEEKS AFTER THEIR DAUGHTER IS BORN, ANNETTE REACHES A BREAKING POINT. [ ANNETTE SCREAMS ] [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] HELLO? Angie: I GET A CALL, AND IT'S CAMERON. HI. WHAT'S UP? HE SAYS, "ANGIE, YOU NEED TO COME OVER HERE "AND CALM HER DOWN. SHE'S REALLY UPSET." I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. LISTEN. JUST DO ME A FAVOR. I THOUGHT MY ANTICS HAD FINALLY PUSHED HER OVER THE EDGE. SHE'S NOT HERE. Narrator: ANGIE PANICS WHEN SHE HEARS ANNETTE IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. Angie: I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HER. I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO HER, AND CAMERON WAS THERE TAKING CARE OF THE BABY. I SAID, "YOU STAY HERE WITH THE BABY. I'LL GO FIND HER." I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. Narrator: COMING UP... ANNETTE ALMOST LOSES EVERYTHING WHEN HER DEMONS RETURN WITH A VENGEANCE. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: FIVE WEEKS AFTER GIVING BIRTH TO A BABY GIRL, ANNETTE HERNANDEZ IS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. [ BABY CRYING ] COUPLED WITH HER HISTORY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, ANNETTE COPES WITH THE PRESSURE THE ONLY WAY SHE CAN THINK OF - BY RUNNING AWAY. HER MOTHER, ANGIE, SEARCHES EVERYWHERE FOR HER DAUGHTER. Angie: I DROVE AROUND. I WENT INTO ALL THE LOCAL BARS. AND SURE ENOUGH, I DID FIND HER IN ONE. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Narrator: ANNETTE IS DRUNK OUT OF HER MIND. Annette: I STOPPED BREAST-FEEDING, AND IT WAS LIKE, "OKAY, WELL, I CAN HANDLE THIS. I CAN HANDLE A DRINK." AND I STARTED DRINKING. AND SHE TURNS AROUND, SHE GOES, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" AND I'M LIKE, "WELL, I'M JUST HERE "TO SEE IF YOU NEEDED A RIDE HOME. YOU READY TO GO HOME?" I HAVE TO FINISH MY DRINK. I UNDERSTAND. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU. I GET IT, I GET IT. BUT YOU ARE COMING WITH ME. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. LET'S GO. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY PURSE! LET'S GO, I SAID! Narrator: ANGIE FINALLY MANAGES TO DRAG HER DAUGHTER OUT OF THE BAR. GOT TO GO! COME ON. LET'S GO. [ DOOR OPENS ] OH, GOD. Narrator: ONCE ANGIE GETS HER DAUGHTER HOME SAFELY, ANNETTE HAS A MAJOR MELTDOWN AND TARGETS HER RAGE AT CAMERON. SHE HAD ASSAULTED HIM, AND HE HAD A BROKEN LIP. AND RATHER THAN TO STAY AND FIGHT SOME MORE, HE TOOK THE BABY AND TOOK OFF. I'M OUT OF HERE! WE'RE OUT OF HERE! LORD... THAT WAS A HORRIBLE NIGHT. Dr. Jordan: ANNETTE'S FITS OF RAGE ARE NOW OFF THE SCALE, AND THEY CANNOT BE EXPLAINED AWAY BY SIMPLE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. IT'S VERY LIKELY HER SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA ARE RETURNING. Narrator: THE STORM PASSES, BUT TO HELP KEEP THINGS STABLE, ANGIE INVITES ANNETTE AND CAMERON TO LIVE WITH HER. Angie: I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA LIVE A DREAM LIFE WITH MY DAUGHTER THERE, MY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER THERE, AND CAMERON, AND I THOUGHT, "WOW. WE'RE GONNA BE A FAMILY." Narrator: BUT ANGIE'S GOT SOME HOUSE RULES TO LIVE BY. I DIDN'T ALLOW DRINKING OR DRUGGING IN THE HOUSE. Narrator: THE HONEYMOON DOESN'T LAST LONG. ANNETTE AND CAMERON AREN'T EXACTLY MODEL HOUSEMATES. THEY'RE CONSTANTLY AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS AND OFTEN COME TO BLOWS. AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE. WE STARTED TO USE... JUST LOSING ALL KIND OF SELF CONTROL. WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GONNA BE A DREAM ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE A NIGHTMARE. YEAH. [ CHUCKLES ] LIKE SO MANY PARENTS, ANGIE IS WELL-INTENTIONED BECAUSE SHE THINKS THAT HER UNCONDITIONAL LOVE CAN SAVE HER DAUGHTER, BUT SHE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THAT ANNETTE IS TRULY IN THE CLUTCHES OF DRUG ADDICTION. THIS SITUATION IS GOING TO BE COMPLETELY OUT OF ANGIE'S CONTROL. Narrator: AFTER SIX MONTHS, ANGIE GETS FED UP AND KICKS THE COUPLE OUT OF THE HOUSE. I TOLD CAMERON, "YOU HAVE TO GET ANOTHER PLACE. "I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE WITH YOU GUYS. I JUST CAN'T. BUT THE BABY IS WELCOME IN THIS HOUSE ANY TIME." FINE! YOU WANT ME OUT? I'M OUT! I'M OUT! FINE! Narrator: CAMERON AND ANNETTE FIND A MODEST APARTMENT NEARBY. BUT RIGHT BEFORE THEY MOVE IN, ANNETTE HITS ROCK BOTTOM. OH, MY GOD. NETTIE, WAKE UP! Narrator: ONE OF HER FRIENDS FINDS HER PASSED OUT AT A BAR. NETTIE! THE AMBULANCE COMES TO GET HER, SHE ENDS UP IN THE HOSPITAL. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: THIS TIME, IT'S A METH OVERDOSE. Angie: SHE WAS SELF-MEDICATING. IF SHE WASN'T ON HER PRESCRIBED MEDICATION, SHE WAS ON STREET DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. SHE HAD TO BE ON SOMETHING TO BLOCK OUT THE VOICES AND THE HALLUCINATIONS, BUT THEY JUST MADE THEM WORSE. Narrator: THE DOCTORS TREATING HER THEN MAKE A STARTLING DISCOVERY. ANNETTE IS PREGNANT AGAIN. WERE YOU SHOCKED? I WAS IN DENIAL ABOUT BEING PREGNANT, AND I ALSO WAS IN DENIAL BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE THAT USED WHEN THEY WERE PREGNANT. THAT'S NOT WHO I WAS. BECAUSE SHE O. D.'d, THE HOSPITAL REPORTS ANNETTE TO CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES. THEY GRANT TEMPORARY CUSTODY OF ANNA TO ANGIE. I WAS UPSET. I WAS UPSET BECAUSE I WASN'T NINE MONTHS PREGNANT, HITTING THE PIPE OR ANYTHING. I WAS HOPING TO CLEAN THINGS UP AND GET THINGS GOING RIGHT AND... YOU KNOW, TO BE THERE. Narrator: ANNETTE AND CAMERON ARE DETERMINED TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN BACK THEIR DAUGHTER. THEY ENROLL IN PARENTING AND ANGER-MANAGEMENT CLASSES AND AGREE TO REGULAR DRUG TESTING. THE WHOLE TIME, I DIDN'T USE. I NEVER HAD A POSITIVE DRUG TEST. I NEVER USED. SEE, I'M FASCINATED BY THAT - THAT YOU CAN JUST QUIT COLD TURKEY WHEN YOU FIND OUT YOU'RE PREGNANT. THE LOGICAL QUESTION IS, IF YOU CAN DO IT WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT, WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT WHEN YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT? I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I JUST - 'CAUSE I - JUST THE FEELING OF HURTING A CHILD, I COULDN'T DO IT. I COULDN'T HURT MY CHILD. I COULDN'T DO THAT. SIX MONTHS LATER, THEIR DEDICATION PAYS OFF. CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES ALLOWS THEIR DAUGHTER, ANNA, TO MOVE BACK IN WITH THEM. CAMERON DECIDES TO CELEBRATE AND RUINS EVERYTHING THEY'VE WORKED FOR. Annette: WE'RE ABOUT TO GET CPS OUT OF OUR LIFE IN, LIKE, A WEEK, AND THEN HE GOES AND USES. AND HE COULDN'T BE AROUND OUR DAUGHTER OR LIVE WITH ME OR HELP ME OUT, SO I WAS NINE MONTHS PREGNANT HAVING TO TAKE CARE OF MY DAUGHTER. Patterson: AND THAT WAS THE STUPIDEST IDEA I'D EVER HAD. I FELT SHAMEFUL, YOU KNOW? I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT I JUST COULDN'T PUT THIS STUFF AWAY. WHY DO I KEEP DOING STUFF WHEN I'VE GOT EVERYTHING TO LIVE FOR? 'CAUSE I'M AN ADDICT. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. [ BABY CRYING ] Narrator: IN JULY 2010, ANNETTE GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY BOY NAMED LUCAS. BUT JUST DAYS LATER, HER WORLD IS RIPPED APART. Patterson: OH, HE WAS BREATHING FUNNY, YOU KNOW, REAL SHORT [PANTING] PANTING. ANNETTE WAS FINALLY LIKE, "I THINK HE NEEDS TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL." SHE WENT IN THE AMBULANCE TO THE HOSPITAL WITH HER BABY BOY. HIS HEART STOPPED. HE WENT INTO FULL CARDIAC ARREST. SHE SAW ALL THAT. SHE SAW ALL THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AROUND HER LITTLE, TINY INFANT, TRYING TO BRING HIM BACK. HE HAD A VIRUS SIMILAR TO THE SWINE FLU, AND IT HID IN HIS HEART. HE WAS ON LIFE SUPPORT. Narrator: ANNETTE IS DEVASTATED. EVERY DAY, SHE WONDERS WHETHER HER SON WILL LIVE OR DIE. Man on P. A.: ICU, PLEASE. BLUE TEAM, ICU. Narrator: SIX WEEKS LATER, HER PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED. ANNETTE CAN FINALLY TAKE HER BABY BOY HOME. BY ALL ACCOUNTS, YOU KNOW, HE SHOULD HAVE DIED. Narrator: CAMERON'S ALLOWED TO MOVE BACK IN AND HELPS ANNETTE CARE FOR BOTH KIDS, BUT THE EMOTIONAL ORDEAL TAKES A HUGE TOLL ON ANNETTE. HER FEAR OF LOSING LUCAS TRIGGERS HER ILLNESS. Annette: I KEPT THINKING SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH HIM AND THERE WASN'T, AND I KIND OF JUST WENT CRAZY BECAUSE I KEPT THINKING THAT HE WAS GONNA DIE. Patterson: SHE WAS AFRAID IF THE WIND WOULD BLOW ON HIM THE WRONG WAY, HE WOULD GET SICK, OR SHE WAS REALLY AFRAID WE'D LOSE HIM. Narrator: ANNETTE IS NOW A TICKING TIME BOMB, READY TO EXPLODE. ONE MOMENT, SHE COULD BE HAPPY, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THE NEXT MOMENT, SHE COULD BE VERY DEPRESSED. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] Narrator: ONE MONTH LATER, CAMERON CALLS ANGIE FROM WORK IN A PANIC. Angie: CAMERON CALLS ME, AND HE SAYS, "ANGIE, GO TO THE HOUSE AND GET BOTH BABIES RIGHT NOW! HURRY UP! GO, GO! HURRY UP!" Narrator: ANGIE RACES TO ANNETTE'S APARTMENT, TERRIFIED OF WHAT SHE'LL FIND. Narrator: FALL 2010. PHOENIX, ARIZONA. AFTER WATCHING HER NEWBORN SON SURVIVE A NEAR-FATAL ILLNESS, ANNETTE HERNANDEZ SUFFERS A MENTAL RELAPSE THAT HAS PUSHED HER OVER THE EDGE. Annette: I HAD THOUGHTS OF HURTING MY CHILDREN. SOMETHING WAS TELLING ME, "HEY, YOU GOT TO TAKE YOUR KIDS OUT. IF YOU DON'T, THEN THEY'RE GONNA SUFFER EVEN MORE." Narrator: ANNETTE'S MOTHER, ANGIE, RUSHES TO ANNETTE'S APARTMENT. [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] ANNETTE! OPEN! I SAID, "ANNETTE, GIVE ME THE BABIES RIGHT NOW!" SHE WOULDN'T OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME... [ KNOCKING CONTINUES ] OPEN! ...SO I CALLED 911. [ WHIMPERING, DIALING ] SHE STEPS OUT ONTO THE PORCH, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, SHE'S THREATENING TOWARDS ME. SHE'S VERY UPSET. HER EYES ARE WILD. SHE'S VERY ANGRY. I SAID, "WHAT'S WRONG? WHY DOES CAMERON WANT ME TO GET THE BABIES? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LET ME SEE THE BABIES. LET ME HAVE THE BABIES." "NO, THEY'RE MY BABIES! WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? THEY'RE MY BABIES. YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM." GET OUT OF HERE! SO, THE POLICE GET THERE. ANNETTE! OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE. COME ON OUTSIDE. STEP ON OUTSIDE. WHERE ARE YOUR BABIES? Narrator: ANNETTE OPENS THE DOOR, LOOKING DAZED. Angie: AND WHAT SHE TELLS THEM IS THAT SHE STARTED HAVING SOME REALLY BAD THOUGHTS. SHE STARTED FEELING SUICIDAL AND FELT THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT THE BABIES AROUND HER AND WAS REALLY UPSET. Narrator: ANNETTE AGREES TO CHECK HERSELF INTO A MENTAL FACILITY. Annette: I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A FEW DAYS, AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA LET ME GO BACK HOME BECAUSE I WAS OKAY, I WASN'T THINKING OF IT ANYMORE. I WAS JUST BEING HONEST. Narrator: BUT CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES WON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES. THEY GIVE ANGIE TEMPORARY CUSTODY OF ANNETTE'S KIDS. DO YOU THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE - TOTALLY HYPOTHETICAL - THAT YOU COULD HAVE HARMED YOUR CHILDREN? I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE 'CAUSE OF MY BLACKOUTS THAT I'D HAVE. Angie: SHE WOULD ALWAYS SAY, "MOM, IF I EVER BECOME A MOM, "I'M A BE A GOOD MOM, I'M GONNA BE A GREAT MOM, I'M GONNA BE SO GOOD TO MY BABIES." I DON'T BELIEVE SHE WOULD HAVE EVER HURT HER BABIES. [ Voice breaking ] I WOULD JUST HOPE NOT. NO. [ SNIFFLES ] Dr. Jordan: NO MOTHER COULD EVER IMAGINE ACTUALLY HURTING HER CHILDREN, BUT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES, SUCH AS PSYCHOSIS OR SCHIZOPHRENIA, IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. IT'S REALLY A BLESSING THAT ANNETTE RECOGNIZED HER THOUGHTS AS HOMICIDAL AND KNEW TO REACH OUT FOR HELP. Narrator: ANNETTE'S DREAM OF HAVING THE PERFECT FAMILY IS COMPLETELY SHATTERED. EVEN WORSE, HER RELATIONSHIP WITH CAMERON CONTINUES TO UNRAVEL. SHUT UP! Annette: WE WERE AT A BAR AND WE'RE ARGUING, AND I CALLED A GUY FRIEND, A GUY THAT I DATED A WHILE BACK IN MY TEENAGE YEARS, AND HE GOT MAD... AND HE DRAGGED ME OUT OF THE BAR. STOP IT! GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME! Patterson: I WAS PRETTY INTOXICATED THAT NIGHT. I PUT HER IN A HEADLOCK, WALKED HER OUT OF THE BAR. LET GO OF ME! STOP IT! I WAS AN **** Narrator: WHEN THEY GET HOME, THE FIGHT ESCALATES. ANNETTE ENDS UP ATTACKING CAMERON AND GETTING ARRESTED. SHE GETS SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS BEHIND BARS FOR ASSAULT WITH BODILY INJURY. THE FIGHT FINALLY SEVERS ANNETTE AND CAMERON'S RELATIONSHIP. IN HER EYES, THERE WAS NO REASON FOR US TO BE TOGETHER. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING, I STILL REMAINED HOPEFUL THAT WE COULD BE ABLE TO WORK THINGS OUT AND BE TOGETHER. I STILL LOVE HER WITH ALL MY HEART. Narrator: AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR, ANNETTE'S RELEASED FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR. NEXT THING WE KNOW, SHE'S OUT ON PAROLE, AND ONE OF THE TERMS OF HER PAROLE WAS TO GO GET BACK ON HER MEDS. WELL, SHE WAS RE-EVALUATED, AND SHE SAID THAT YEAR IN STATE JAIL TAUGHT HER A LESSON. SHE FELT BETTER. SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS GONNA BE OKAY NOW 'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T EVER WANT TO GO TO JAIL AGAIN. THERE IS NO WAY A YEAR IN JAIL IS GONNA CURE SCHIZOPHRENIA. AND SHE DIDN'T GET HER MEDICINE. Narrator: THOUGH ANGIE IS SKEPTICAL, ANNETTE IS CONFIDENT SHE CAN LEAD A NORMAL LIFE WITHOUT BEING MEDICATED. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] ANNETTE'S ONLY ALLOWED TO SEE HER CHILDREN SUPERVISED, SO SHE MOVES IN WITH HER FATHER. SHE STARTS WORKING AT A NEARBY HOTEL RESTAURANT. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE ANNETTE CATCHES THE EYE OF A YOUNG COWORKER. HE SEEMED TO BE VERY FRIENDLY. HE WAS BEING FLIRTATIOUS. I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT. Narrator: TONY IS EIGHT YEARS YOUNGER THAN ANNETTE. SHE LIKES THE ATTENTION, AND THEY START DATING. Dr. Jordan: WAS TONY LIKE CAMERON? NO. HE WAS NOT. HOW WAS HE DIFFERENT? HE DIDN'T USE METH OR ANYTHING. HE HADN'T EXPERIENCED LIFE A WHOLE LOT. HE DIDN'T HAVE TOO MANY GIRLFRIENDS. TO ME, HE WAS JUST PURE. HE WAS VERY INNOCENT TO ME. TONY IS ONLY 19. HE'S WIDE-EYED AND INNOCENT, AND THIS APPEALS TO ANNETTE BECAUSE HE HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF HER PAST HISTORY, AND SO WITH TONY, SHE CAN REGAIN CONTROL. Narrator: ANNETTE'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT FROM THE START. Angie: I DIDN'T WANT HER TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MEN ANYMORE. HERE WAS THIS YOUNG, 19-YEAR-OLD YOUNG MAN. I WAS THINKING, "OH, JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE "AND LET HIM GO THROUGH LIFE, LIKE YOU HAVE. LET HIM GO WITH SOMEBODY HIS OWN AGE." I DID NOT WANT HER TO BE WITH TONY. Narrator: COMING UP... WHEN ANNETTE'S NEW ROMANCE FALLS APART, IT LEAVES A TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION IN ITS WAKE. Narrator: JULY 2012. PHOENIX, ARIZONA. ANNETTE HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET HER TROUBLED LIFE BACK ON TRACK AFTER BATTLING MENTAL ILLNESS. SHE THINKS SHE'S CURED AFTER SPENDING ALMOST A YEAR IN JAIL FOR ASSAULT. WHEN SHE MEETS A YOUNG MAN NAMED TONY, SHE THINKS HER TURBULENT DAYS ARE OVER. SHE'S DEAD WRONG. AFTER JUST A MONTH OF DATING, ANNETTE AND TONY MOVE IN TOGETHER. BUT ANNETTE'S BACK TO USING AND HIDING IT FROM TONY - OR SO SHE THINKS. NO, I WILL NOT CALM DOWN! I WILL NOT CALM DOWN, OKAY?! WHY? 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS HIGH? TAKE THAT BACK! I AM NOT! WHAT HAVE I BEEN LYING ABOUT? EVERYTHING! IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE RELATIONSHIP TO SOUR. Dr. Jordan: WITH HER HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AND THE DEVASTATION OF JUST HAVING LOST CUSTODY OF HER TWO CHILDREN, SHE REALLY HAS NOTHING TO OFFER TONY EXCEPT FOR MORE PAIN AND DANGER. I NEVER HEARD HER HAVING FIGHTS WITH HER GIRLFRIENDS. I NEVER HEARD HER HAVING FIGHTS WITH HER COUSINS, WITH FEMALES. IT WAS JUST THE MEN IN HER LIFE - ALWAYS. Narrator: AFTER TWO MONTHS OF CONSTANT FIGHTING, ANNETTE AND TONY CALL IT QUITS, AND TONY MOVES OUT. WE STILL CALL EACH OTHER AND TALK OR WHATEVER, BUT THERE'S SOME BITTERNESS THERE. Narrator: ANNETTE TAKES THE BREAKUP PRETTY HARD. I WENT THROUGH A DRUG BINGE - LIKE, A BAD, BAD DRUG BINGE. I MEAN, IT WAS BAD. I WAS GETTING HIGH A LOT. I WAS USING METH. Narrator: TWO WEEKS LATER, ON OCTOBER 2, 2012, TONY INVITES ANNETTE TO HIS HOUSE TO TALK THINGS OVER. ANNETTE SHOWS UP SLEEP-DEPRIVED AND ON EDGE. TONY IS IMMEDIATELY SUSPICIOUS. YOU'RE SWEATING. Annette: AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, YOU'VE LOST ABOUT 15 POUNDS SINCE I SAW YOU." HE GOES, "HOW DID YOU LOSE THAT?" I SAID, "YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN STRESSED OUT." I DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT THAT I'D BEEN USING. I DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT. BUT HE KNEW. YEAH, HE KNEW. Narrator: SUDDENLY, ANNETTE GETS A FLOOD OF TEXTS. SO, HE GRABS MY PHONE. HE'S LIKE, "LOOK. SOMEBODY'S TEXTING YOU." AND HE GETS UPSET, AND I GRAB HIS PHONE. IT WAS JUST A STUPID, LITTLE, IMMATURE ARGUMENT. I WASN'T HIGH ON METH AT THAT TIME. I WAS STRUNG OUT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I REMEMBER BEING MAD AT EVERYTHING, JUST BEING MAD AT THE WORLD. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY? IT'S THE CULMINATION OF DAYS AND DAYS OF DRUG USE, GETTING HIGH, GOING LOW, FIGHTING OFF WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS AND FEELING CHRONICALLY AGITATED FROM LACK OF SLEEP. ANNETTE WAS READY TO GO OFF LIKE A POWDER KEG. Narrator: ANNETTE CLAIMS SHE HAS ALMOST NO MEMORY OF WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. YOU'RE **** NUTS! IT'S LIKE I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED. I HAD OPENED UP THE DRAWER BY THE OVEN. TURN AROUND AND SAY SOMETHING! AND I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE KNIVES AND I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE SKINNIEST KNIFE AND PICKING IT UP AND I REMEMBER GRIPPING IT AS TIGHT AS I COULD IN MY HAND. AND I SWEAR, IT'S LIKE I BLANKED. I REMEMBER NOTHING. I JUST REMEMBER OPENING MY EYES, AND I JUST SAW - IT WAS A LOT OF BLOOD. I SAW A LOT OF BLOOD. I'M JUST FREAKING OUT. I DIDN'T REMEMBER WHAT I DID. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT I DID THAT. YOU DON'T REMEMBER STABBING TONY? NO. I DON'T. WAS IT A BLACKOUT? WAS IT A FUGUE? WAS IT DEMONS? WAS IT YOUR MENTAL ILLNESS COMING OVER YOU? I WASN'T FEELING WELL THAT DAY. IT'S LIKE, YOU COULD'VE TOLD ME I STABBED HIM ONE TIME, AND I WOULD'VE BELIEVED YOU. YOU COULD'VE TOLD ME I STABBED HIM 100 TIMES - I WOULD'VE BELIEVED YOU. ACCORDING TO COURT RECORDS, HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU STAB HIM? TWICE. YOU STABBED HIM TWICE? YEAH. [ GRUNTS ] [ GROANS ] [ GROANS ] IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN FUELED BY LOTS OF ALCOHOL, LOTS OF METH, AND HER MENTAL ILLNESS. IT WAS ALL THOSE COMBINED. IT WAS EVERYTHING COMBINED. Narrator: A NEIGHBOR CALLS 911. Man: IS HE AWAKE? Woman: YEAH, HE'S AWAKE. HE'S TALKING. IS HE BREATHING? HE'S TALKING. WE HAVE PARAMEDICS ON THE WAY. STAY ON THE LINE FOR ME, OKAY? SHE IS IN THE BUILDING, SO THERE NEEDS TO BE PEOPLE HERE IMMEDIATELY. WHO IS IN THE BUILDING? HIS GIRLFRIEND STABBED HIM, AND SHE'S IN THE BUILDING. HIS GIRLFRIEND STABBED HIM, AND SHE'S IN THE BUILDING? I SAW HER, YES. I DIDN'T SEE HER DO IT, BUT I SAW HER IN THE BUILDING. I JUST CAME OUT HERE. WHILE WAITING FOR POLICE TO ARRIVE, ANNETTE APPEARS, DAZED AND COVERED IN BLOOD. SHE'S STANDING RIGHT HERE. WHO'S STANDING RIGHT THERE? SIT DOWN! YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN! RIGHT NOW! SIT DOWN! I'M NOT KIDDING! SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GET HERE REALLY QUICKLY! MA'AM, WE ARE COMING AS FAST AS WE CAN. I'M PUTTING THE PHONE DOWN. PUT IT DOWN IF YOU HAVE TO PUT IT DOWN, BUT I NEED YOU TO STAY NEXT TO IT. TONY DIDN'T SURVIVE, DID HE? NO. [ SIREN WAILS ] MA'AM, GET DOWN! ON THE GROUND! GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN! ANNETTE IS ARRESTED ON THE SCENE. HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK! Angie: [ Voice breaking ] IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT REAL. IT CAN'T BE REAL... THAT A... THAT A CHILD THAT I BROUGHT INTO THIS WORLD TOOK SOMEBODY OUT OF IT. MY OWN DAUGHTER. [ SNIFFLES ] [ HANDCUFFS CLICK ] Dr. Jordan: WITH THE EARLY CHILDHOOD DIAGNOSIS OF PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA, IT REALLY SEEMS THAT THE DECK WAS STACKED AGAINST ANNETTE FROM THE OUTSET. WHAT IF SHE HAD GOTTEN THE HELP THAT SHE NEEDED FROM AN EARLY AGE AND NOT GONE DOWN THE PATH OF SELF-MEDICATING WITH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL? COULD SHE HAVE AVOIDED THE LIFE THAT ENDED WITH PRISON AND DEATH? Narrator: IN MARCH 2013, ANNETTE PLEADS GUILTY TO MURDER AND IS SENTENCED TO 40 YEARS IN PRISON. Annette: I TOOK SOMEBODY'S LIFE THAT DESERVES TO BE HERE. I DON'T CARE IF I DO THE WHOLE 40 YEARS. THAT DOES NOT BOTHER ME BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF LIFE I HAD OUT THERE - [ Voice breaking ] IT'S JUST THE EXTENT OF PAIN THAT I CAUSED, THAT I COULDN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY DOING THAT TO MY KIDS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD FORGIVE SOMEBODY. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
