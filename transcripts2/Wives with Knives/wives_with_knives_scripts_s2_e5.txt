 I BROUGHT MY CHECKBOOK. Narrator: ...UNTIL THIS DANGEROUS GAME OF BETRAYAL AND REVENGE REACHES A BOILING POINT. I WAS SCARED THAT I WAS REALLY GONNA PAY NOW. Narrator: NOT ALL FAIRY TALES HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS. [ WOMAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] WHEN LOVE GOES WRONG, A WOMAN CAN DO THE UNTHINKABLE. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS 1986.

 [ INDISTINCT YELLING ] WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? SHE'S CHEATING ON ME! Narrator: ACCORDING TO MONICA, HER FATHER DESTROYS THE HOUSE WHEN HE SUSPECTS HER MOTHER IS HAVING AN AFFAIR. THE ENTIRE HOUSE WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. OH, MY GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. Narrator: MONICA WORSHIPS HER FATHER, DESPITE HIS DRINKING, AND BLAMES HIS ISSUES ON HER MOTHER. Monica: WE'VE JUST HAD CONFLICT SINCE I COULD REMEMBER. I DIDN'T THINK THAT SHE LIVED UP TO THE STANDARD THAT I THOUGHT MY FATHER NEEDED TO HELP HIM. AND, SO, I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE PROBLEM AND NOT HIM. HIS DRINKING WAS BECAUSE OF HER. Narrator: REGARDLESS OF WHO'S AT FAULT, MONICA JUST WANTS THE FIGHTING TO STOP. SHE THINKS THE ONLY WAY IS TO GET HER FATHER TO QUIT DRINKING. I THOUGHT I COULD SAVE HIM. Narrator: MONICA FINALLY GETS HER WISH. HER FATHER SEEKS HELP AND GETS SOBER. DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLIC PARENTS ARE VERY OFTEN CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE. THEY'RE GOING TO CONFUSE LOVE WITH PITY. IN THE CASE OF MONICA, SHE WOULD PITY HER FATHER AND DESPISE HER MOTHER BECAUSE SHE FELT LIKE HER MOTHER WASN'T DOING ENOUGH. I'LL BE BACK BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. Narrator: BUT THINGS DON'T TURN OUT AS MONICA HAD HOPED. I WISH YOU WOULD STAY. ONCE HER FATHER HAS HIS LIFE BACK ON TRACK, HE BUYS A TRUCKING BUSINESS AND IS AWAY FROM HOME FOR DAYS AT A TIME. THIS LEAVES HER HOME ALONE WITH HER MOTHER. I'M GLAD HE'S GONE. HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM YOU. EXCUSE ME? Narrator: IT'S LIKE POURING GASOLINE ON AN OPEN FLAME. ...TO ME THAT WAY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? Chip: OH, MY GOD. THEY WOULD FIGHT OVER THE COLOR OF THE SKY - JUST THE DUMBEST CRAP EVER. I THINK THERE WAS ALSO, BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM, A LITTLE JEALOUSY OF ATTENTION FROM MY FATHER. Narrator: WHEN MONICA TURNS 15, SHE DECIDES SHE'S HAD ENOUGH. YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA RUN OFF? SHE PACKS HER THINGS AND GOES TO LIVE WITH A FRIEND AND HER FAMILY. A YEAR LATER, SHE QUITS SCHOOL, GETS HER G. E. D., AND BECOMES A CATALOG MODEL. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] THAT'S AMAZING. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. Narrator: MONICA IS A NATURAL IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. Monica: I'D NEVER SEEK TO BE CENTER OF ATTENTION. I JUST ALWAYS DID WHAT I EITHER WANTED TO DO OR I KNEW TO DO OR HOW TO DO. LOOKING GOOD, MONICA. I OFTEN WAS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION IN JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT I DID. THAT'S GREAT. RIGHT THERE. HOLD THAT. Narrator: WITH HER COVER GIRL LOOKS, MONICA SEEMS TO HAVE IT ALL. BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS, SHE WANTS A JOB WITH MORE MEANING AND DECIDES TO JOIN THE MILITARY. THAT WAS A VERY FIRM BELIEF THAT I HAD - THAT SERVICE. I JOINED THE ARMY AS A MILITARY POLICE. Narrator: AT AGE 19, MONICA GETS DEPLOYED TO SAUDI ARABIA WITH OPERATION DESERT STORM. IS THAT A CHALLENGE? THANKS. SHE CLAIMS HER JOB IS TO PARTY WITH THE MALE SOLDIERS AND FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE GETTING ILLEGAL DRUGS. I'M READY FOR SOMETHING NEW. THANKS, BOYS. I WORKED UNDERCOVER IN A DRUG-ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE. LET ME GET YOU ANOTHER BEER. I WAS KIND OF HOPING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT, UM, STRONGER. Narrator: SHE QUICKLY LEARNS HOW TO USE HER LOOKS TO GET WHAT SHE NEEDS. MONICA WAS SOMEONE WHO WEAPONIZED SEX AND WEAPONIZED HER APPEARANCE. GOT A GOOD HOOKUP? AND SHE DID IT VERY WELL. SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. SHE KNEW HOW TO USE IT. Dr. Jordan: AS THE CHILD OF AN ALCOHOLIC, MONICA WOULD HAVE STUFFED DOWN HER EMOTIONS AND ALWAYS DENY HER OWN NEEDS. BUT ONCE SHE WAS IN THE MILITARY, SHE FOUND STRENGTH IN HER ABILITY TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE, AND THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS ALL OF HER FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS. HELL, YEAH, I DO. Narrator: AFTER A YEAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MONICA RETURNS TO INDIANA. SHE TRANSFERS TO THE NATIONAL GUARD TO COMPLETE HER SERVICE WHILE GOING TO SCHOOL TO GET HER BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN HEALTH ADMINISTRATION. AT NIGHT, SHE AND HER FRIENDS HIT THE LOCAL BAR SCENE, WHERE SHE CATCHES THE EYE OF PRACTICALLY EVERY MAN IN THE ROOM. ONE OF THEM IS RICHIE CAMDEN, WHOSE WEALTHY FAMILY OWNS SEVERAL BUSINESSES IN TOWN. AND THERE WAS SOME CHEMISTRY? DEFINITELY. DEFINITELY. IMMEDIATELY. HE WAS VERY GOOD-LOOKING - VERY GOOD-LOOKING MAN. THE TWO BECOME AN ITEM ALMOST INSTANTLY. MONICA, NICE TO MEET YOU. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. [ LAUGHS ] WHEN MONICA FINDS OUT SHE'S PREGNANT JUST THREE MONTHS LATER, RICHIE'S PARENTS INSIST THEY GET MARRIED. Monica: I LOVED HIS PARENTS. HIS FAMILY WAS PROBABLY HIS STRONGEST QUALITY. Narrator: EVEN THOUGH MONICA DOESN'T LOVE RICHIE, SHE AGREES TO MARRY HIM. RIGHT HERE? [ CHUCKLES ] RIGHT HERE. Richards: I DON'T THINK SHE THOUGHT OF PEOPLE HAVING ANY EMOTIONAL VALUE AT ALL. I THINK EACH PERSON SHE RAN ACROSS, SHE THOUGHT OF, IN A WAY, TO MANIPULATE OR USE THEM. [ LAUGHS ] BECAUSE MARRIAGE IS ONE OF THE MOST SACRED COVENANTS... Narrator: MONICA KNOWS A SHOTGUN WEDDING ISN'T A GREAT IDEA... AND MONICA FAIRVIEW... Narrator: ...BUT, DEEP DOWN, SHE HOPES THE MARRIAGE AND THE BABY WILL SOMEHOW FILL A VOID LEFT BY HER OWN DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY. MONICA NEVER SAW ANY TRAITS OF A MARRIAGE BASED ON LOVE AND TRUST, AND WITHOUT HAVING ANY DEPTH OF EMOTION HERSELF, IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT THIS MARRIAGE WILL SURVIVE. SHE'S SCARED TO LOVE. WHEN SHE GETS TOO CLOSE TO SOMEBODY, I FEEL LIKE IT SCARES HER BECAUSE MAYBE PEOPLE HAVE LEFT HER IN HER PAST. IT'S LIKE SHE'S DESTRUCTIVE. Priest: HE JOINS YOU TOGETHER IN ONE OF THE HOLIEST BONDS. [ APPLAUSE ] Narrator: SEVEN MONTHS LATER, THE NEWLYWEDS WELCOME A GIRL THEY NAME DAKOTA. [ BABY COOS ] THE BABY'S ARRIVAL QUICKLY REVEALS THE CRACKS IN THE YOUNG COUPLE'S RELATIONSHIP. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA BE AN EXCELLENT STAY-AT-HOME MOM. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I'M GOING BACK TO WORK. BABE, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. I HAVE TO BE BRINGING IN THE MONEY. SOMEONE'S GOT TO STAY WITH THE BABY. WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE HER TO MY PARENTS EVERY DAY. WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF HER? WE CAN HIRE A BABYSITTER. Narrator: RICHIE WANTS A TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE, WHERE HE'S THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD. MONICA DOESN'T WANT TO BE CONTROLLED. I'M DONE. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. ONE NIGHT, RICHIE AND MONICA PLAN A NIGHT OUT TOGETHER. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] THEY LEAVE DAKOTA WITH RICHIE'S PARENTS AND HEAD TO A LOCAL NIGHTCLUB. WE WENT WITH SOME OF MY MILITARY FRIENDS THAT WERE IN TOWN, THE GIRLS AND I WERE DANCING IN A CIRCLE, AND A GENTLEMAN HAD JUMPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT CIRCLE. A LOT OF GIRLS IN THE CLUB, BUT I THINK I PICKED THE RIGHT ONE. RICHIE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF THAT IT WAS A THREAT. Chip: SHE'S ALWAYS DRAWN IN THE TYPE OF MEN THAT GET VERY JEALOUS VERY EASILY. Narrator: ACCORDING TO MONICA, RICHIE STORMS ONTO THE DANCE FLOOR. WHOA! HEY! RICHIE! WHO THE HELL ARE YOU, MAN?! MY WIFE - WIFE?! YOUR WIFE?! Monica: PUSHES THE GUY AND STARTS A FISTFIGHT, WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY BROKE UP, AND HE WAS ASKED TO LEAVE. LET'S GO, MONICA! Narrator: RICHIE DEMANDS THAT MONICA LEAVE WITH HIM. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG! Monica: HE WAS MAKING A VERY BIG STANCE THAT I WAS HIS WOMAN AND THAT I WAS TO LEAVE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE DEMANDED, AND I CHOSE NOT TO. Narrator: MONICA TRIES TO BRUSH OFF THE FIGHT AND CONTINUES PARTYING WITH HER FRIENDS. [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] BUT AT CLOSING TIME, SHE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO GO HOME TO FACE THE MUSIC. WHAT... THE HELL? I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THE ENTIRE PLACE TURNED OVER - FURNITURE, THINGS BROKE. UGH! RICHIE! Narrator: SHE FINDS RICHIE IN THEIR BEDROOM. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? Narrator: MONICA FAIRVIEW THINKS SHE FINALLY HAS THE FAMILY THAT SHE'S ALWAYS DREAMED OF - A DEVOTED HUSBAND AND A NEW BABY. WHOA! HEY! BUT HER WORLD COMES CRASHING DOWN AFTER HER HUSBAND, RICHIE, FLIES INTO A JEALOUS RAGE AND TAKES IT OUT ON THEIR HOME. RICHIE! WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING? WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING? THIS MARRIAGE IS A JOKE! OKAY. YOU NEED TO COOL DOWN. I'D NEVER SEEN THAT BEHAVIOR FROM HIM BEFORE. HE HAD NEVER LOST HIS TEMPER, EVER. OH, YOU GONNA CALL YOUR BOYFRIEND FOR PROTECTION? NO. I'M CALLING YOUR PARENTS. LISTEN, WE'RE HAVING A PROBLEM HERE, AND I'M... AND JUST WATCHING HIS ANGER, I KNEW IF HE HIT ME ONCE, THAT WOULD ALL THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO SERIOUSLY HURT ME, AND I WASN'T GONNA WAIT FOR THAT. SO, I'M GONNA COME PICK UP DAKOTA RIGHT NOW. Narrator: MONICA PICKS UP HER DAUGHTER FROM HER IN-LAWS AND GOES TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE. THE NEXT DAY, SHE CALLS RICHIE TO TELL HIM WHERE SHE AND DAKOTA ARE AND TO ASK FOR A DIVORCE. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] HELLO? HEY. UNFORTUNATELY FOR MONICA, HER HUSBAND'S WILLING TO LET HER GO, BUT HE ISN'T ABOUT TO LET HER WIN. I THINK WE SHOULD GET A DIVORCE. OKAY, MONICA. WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM MY LAWYER, THEN. RICHIE GETS HIS FAMILY'S LAWYER TO FIGHT FOR CUSTODY OF THEIR DAUGHTER. Monica: HE HAD ACTUALLY FILED IN THE COURTS THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE I WAS AT OR WHERE THE CHILD WAS, AND HE WAS IN FEAR OF DANGER FOR THE CHILD. [ CRICKETS CHIRPING, DOG BARKS ] Narrator: MONICA CLAIMS THAT SHE NEVER GETS THE NOTICE FOR HER COURT HEARING AND THAT WHEN SHE DOESN'T SHOW UP, THE COURT GRANTS CUSTODY TO RICHIE. [ BABY COOS ] MONICA VOWS TO WIN HER DAUGHTER BACK, BUT TO DO SO, SHE NEEDS MONEY FOR A LAWYER. A FRIEND FINDS HER A JOB AS A FINANCE MANAGER AT A CAR DEALERSHIP. BUT SHE HAS TO MOVE OVER 500 MILES AWAY FROM INDIANAPOLIS TO ATLANTA, GEORGIA. THEN YOU GET SMOKED. EVEN THOUGH IT'S FAR FROM DAKOTA, MONICA TRIES TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT AND SETTLES IN. ONE NIGHT, SHE DECIDES TO STOP FOR A DRINK ON HER WAY HOME... YOU SHOULDN'T EAT THOSE. THEY'RE NASTY. ...AND SHE CATCHES THE EYE OF A MAN NAMED ROB KRAMER. THEY'RE NOT NASTY. WHEN HE MEETS MONICA, HE THINKS HE'S HIT THE JACKPOT. Richards: WELL, THEY DON'T FIT TOGETHER AT ALL. SHE WAS GOING TO BE THE HOTTEST-LOOKING THING HE WAS GONNA BE ABLE TO GET, SO SHE WAS A PRIZE EGG, MAN. DID YOU JUST GET OFF WORK, OR DO YOU NORMALLY LOOK THIS...? Narrator: ROB IS A SUCCESSFUL CONSTRUCTION SALES MANAGER. ROB WAS VERY FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING AND CHARMING, ROMANTIC, SMART. GUYS DO THAT. I DON'T - I DON'T DO THAT. ROB'S NOT A [CHUCKLES] - HE'S NOT A VERY HANDSOME MAN, SO IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE LOOKS. WHY DON'T WE TALK IT OVER OVER DINNER? SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE GIRLS THAT WAS ATTRACTED TO MEN WHO TOOK CONTROL OF THINGS, AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY ROB. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. Narrator: AT FIRST, MONICA DOESN'T FEEL A SPARK, BUT AFTER A FEW FANCY DINNERS, SHE'S DECIDED ROB'S GOT RELATIONSHIP POTENTIAL. THAT'S GREAT NEWS. THANK YOU. HERE ARE THE BEERS YOU ASKED FOR. Narrator: SHE'S FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION HE GIVES HER, AND IT DOESN'T HURT THAT HE MAKES A GOOD LIVING. DRINK UP. [ GLASSES CLINK ] WITHIN MONTHS, ROB ASKS HER TO MARRY HIM. YEAH. IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS? ABSOLUTELY. BUT MONICA'S SEEN SOME RED FLAGS AND NEEDS SOME TIME TO THINK THINGS OVER. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS, Ringing ] [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] ROB IS MORE THAN JUST A SOCIAL DRINKER. HEY, BABY. DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE AT THE BAR AGAIN. LOOK, I KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM, OKAY? BUT HE TREATS HER WELL AND EVEN PAYS FOR A LAWYER SO MONICA CAN FIGHT FOR CUSTODY OF DAKOTA. YOU NEED A LAWYER? I'LL PAY FOR IT, ALL RIGHT? Dr. Jones: TIME AND AGAIN, WE SEE ADULT CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS SUBCONSCIOUSLY DRAWN TO OTHER ALCOHOLICS. THIS IS A RECIPE FOR DYSFUNCTION IN A MARRIAGE AND A REPETITION OF THE PATTERN THAT MADE THEM SO MISERABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. Narrator: TO CONVINCE MONICA TO ACCEPT HIS PROPOSAL, ROB PROMISES TO CURB HIS DRINKING. THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. EVEN THOUGH MONICA DOESN'T LOVE ROB, SHE FEELS INDEBTED TO HIM AND FEELS OBLIGATED TO SAY YES. LET'S GET MARRIED. ARE YOU SERIOUS? BABY, THAT IS FANTASTIC! Monica: IT WASN'T A ROMANTIC "IT WAS MEANT TO BE." IT WAS A LIMIT OF OPTIONS. THERE WAS NO FAMILY, NO WHERE ELSE, REALLY, TO GO, AND HERE WAS THIS MAN THAT I FELT WAS DOING AN HONORABLE THING. I FELT LIKE IT WAS MY DUTY. WE'RE HERE TODAY, BEFORE GOD, BECAUSE MARRIAGE IS ONE OF... Narrator: IN DECEMBER 1998, MONICA AND ROB MARRY IN AN ELABORATE CEREMONY HOSTED BY HIS WEALTHY PARENTS. Priest: ...LOVE AND COMMITMENT. Narrator: ONCE AGAIN, SHE'S COMMITTING TO A MAN SHE DOESN'T LOVE. Dr. Jones: SO, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE WITH ROB MORE BECAUSE IT IS BENEFICIAL TO YOUR IDEA OF A FAMILY THAN BECAUSE YOU REALLY LOVE HIM. I'D - I'D NEVER FELT THAT LOVE WAS NECESSARY. I DON'T THINK I EVER HAD IT - UNCONDITIONAL. IT WAS MORE OF A DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO THE FAMILY. I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT MADE IT WORK. MEANWHILE, ROB IS COMPLETELY INFATUATED WITH THE WOMAN HE MANAGED TO LAND, AND HE'LL DO ANYTHING TO HOLD ON TO HER. Richards: MONICA WAS, YOU KNOW, A HOT-LOOKING WOMAN, YOU KNOW, AND GREAT ARM CANDY. YOU KNOW, I THINK MAYBE HE SAW HER AS A TROPHY WIFE. SHE'S GORGEOUS, AND SHE HAS AN OUTGOING PERSONALITY. I MEAN, SHE'S FUN. ROB ISN'T THAT ATTRACTIVE, SO I FELT LIKE HE FELT VERY BLESSED. [ BABY COOS ] Narrator: JANUARY 2000. A YEAR AFTER THEIR WEDDING, MONICA GIVES BIRTH TO HER SECOND CHILD, A GIRL SHE AND ROB NAME ALEX. SHE QUITS HER JOB TO BECOME A FULL-TIME MOM AND CONTINUES TO FIGHT FOR CUSTODY OF DAKOTA, WHO'S NOW 5. Monica: I WAS VERY BUSY WITH THE BABY. I WAS INVOLVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. [ BABY FUSSING ] IT WAS THE IDEAL SUBURBAN LIFE THAT THEY HAD GOING ON. [ BABY CRYING ] Narrator: ACCORDING TO MONICA, IN 2003, RICHIE DECIDES TO LET HER HAVE FULL CUSTODY OF DAKOTA, COMPLETING HER FAMILY. WITH ANOTHER MOUTH TO FEED, MONICA WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE AND GETS A JOB AS A REALTOR. AT FIRST, ROB IS OPEN TO HIS WIFE'S NEW CAREER, BUT HER JOB QUICKLY REVEALS HIS INSECURITIES ABOUT THEIR MARRIAGE. I BELIEVE THAT ROB FELT THAT HE LOST A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROL OF HER WHEN SHE WAS WORKING. AND THERE SHE IS. IF IT ISN'T THE MOTHER OF THE YEAR. Fox: THE MINUTE SHE TRIED TO FIND HERSELF, BE AN INDEPENDENT PERSON ON HER OWN, HE WOULD STOP IT AT EVERY TURN. HE WOULD TELL HER, "YOU'RE AN AWFUL WIFE." HE WOULD TELL HER SHE WAS AN AWFUL MOTHER. Narrator: MONICA STANDS HER GROUND AND REFUSES TO GIVE UP HER CAREER. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SOLD A HOUSE? GO TO HELL. Narrator: THEN, A YEAR LATER, ROB GETS A HUGE JOB PROMOTION AND A MAJOR SALARY BUMP. Monica: HE WAS MORE ADAMANT ABOUT ME NOT WORKING. HE THOUGHT IT WAS DISRESPECTFUL TO HIM IF I CHOSE TO WORK. Narrator: MONICA EVENTUALLY GIVES IN TO ROB'S WISHES. SHE QUITS HER JOB AND TRIES TO EMBRACE HER ROLE AS A STAY-AT-HOME MOM. WITH LOTS OF MONEY COMING IN, AND ALL OF IT FROM HIM, ROB FEELS SECURE AGAIN. THE COUPLE STARTS LIVING THE HIGH LIFE. SHE'S GORGEOUS. ISN'T SHE? I LOVE IT. Chip: THEY BOUGHT A YACHT. THEY HAD JET SKIS. THEY HAD EVERYTHING. WE CAN PUT THE GIRLS ON THERE. Narrator: BUT MONICA SOON LEARNS THAT HER LUXURIOUS LIFESTYLE COMES WITH SOME MAJOR STRINGS ATTACHED. I ALREADY GAVE YOU MONEY. DRINKING, BIG BOATS, BIG HOUSES, BIG CARS. IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY FOR YOU. Monica: HE WAS VERY ELABORATE IN HIS SPENDING ON HIMSELF. THERE WAS NO BIG SHOPPING SPREES FOR ME OR THE CHILDREN. THAT'S WHAT IT ALWAYS IS. HE MADE IT CLEAR TO ME, THOUGH, THAT I SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT I EVEN LIVE THE LIFESTYLE THAT I LIVE, AND IT ALL COULD BE TAKEN AWAY FROM ME. MIGHTY ROB, HUH? YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT IT IS! THE CHECKS WERE NOT IN MY NAME. I DID NOT EVEN CARRY ANY CREDIT CARDS. WHEN MONICA GIVES UP HER CAREER TO BE A STAY-AT-HOME MOM, SHE MAY HAVE UNDERESTIMATED HOW MUCH CONTROL ROB WOULD HAVE OVER HER, BECAUSE HE CONTROLS THE PURSE STRINGS. SHE MAY USE HER SEX AS A WEAPON, BUT ROB USED HIS PAYCHECK AS A WEAPON. Narrator: IN EARLY 2005, MONICA'S BROTHER, CHIP, MOVES TO ATLANTA. HE'S DOWN ON HIS LUCK AND NEEDS A PLACE TO STAY. OOH, MONICA! CHIP. Narrator: MONICA INVITES HIM TO LIVE WITH THEM. ROB NOT ONLY AGREES BUT HELPS HIM GET BACK ON HIS FEET. YOU EVER NEED A HAND WITH MONEY OR ANYTHING, YOU JUST LET ME KNOW. Chip: THIS IS ALMOST A "DR. JEKYLL, MR. HYDE" KIND OF THING, BECAUSE THE WAY HE WAS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE AND THE WAY HE WAS WITH HER WAS TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. YOU GUYS HAVE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE. YES, WE DO. Monica: I'M JUST ASKING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY! YOU WOULD THINK I WAS ASKING FOR BLOOD! Narrator: IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR CHIP TO REALIZE HIS SISTER'S MARRIAGE IS UNRAVELING. IT'S OUR MONEY! WE'RE MARRIED! REMEMBER? ROB WAS VERY VERBALLY ABUSIVE... YOU'RE A MONEY-GRUBBING BITCH! ...JUST A TIME BOMB WAITING TO HAPPEN. WILL YOU GUYS JUST CALM DOWN? WHOSE HOUSE IS THIS?! IT WAS A MARRIAGE THAT WAS GOING TO HORRIBLY END. SHUT YOUR MOUTH! KISS MY ASS, YOU UGLY FREAK. HEY! DON'T EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN! IF IT ISN'T THE MOTHER OF THE YEAR. Narrator: DAILY BATTLES OVER MONEY, DRINKING, AND CONTROL HAVE PUSHED MONICA AND ROB KRAMER'S SEVEN-YEAR MARRIAGE TO THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. YOU'RE A MONEY-GRUBBING BITCH! THIS VOLATILE COUPLE IS A TICKING TIME BOMB, EVEN THOUGH THEIR FIGHTS HAVEN'T GOTTEN PHYSICAL... YET. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT IT IS! ONE SUNNY SATURDAY AFTERNOON IN THE FALL OF 2005, MONICA AND ROB HAVE SOME NEIGHBORS OVER FOR A POOL PARTY. YEAH, SURE. GO AHEAD. HAVE ANOTHER ONE. BUT BY NOW, THE TWO CAN BARELY STAND EACH OTHER... HOW MANY IS THAT FOR YOU, ANYWAY, NOW? LIKE, 50? ...AND THINGS ARE ABOUT TO COME TO A HEAD. THEY HAD BEEN ARGUING ALL DAY - ALL DAY LONG DURING THE DAY - OVER DRINKING. WHO MADE YOU THE MARGARITA NAZI? ROB WAS MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT HER, USING THE "C" WORD, AND CALLING HER A BITCH. JUST SHUT UP! Narrator: MONICA IS FED UP WITH ROB'S VENOM. WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP... BITCH? HEY! WHEN MONICA'S BROTHER, CHIP, COMES TO HIS SISTER'S DEFENSE, HE GETS CAUGHT IN THE CROSS FIRE. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? Chip: HE POINTED HIS FINGER IN MY FACE AND CALLED ME A NAME OR TWO AND SHOVED ME. Narrator: MONICA SNAPS. I AM SICK OF YOU, ROB! YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY BROTHER! [ GRUNTS ] Chip: IT WAS JUST LIKE LIGHTNING. THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FASTEST PUNCHES I'VE EVER SEEN THROWN. YOU DIRTY, LITTLE BITCH! BASTARD. Chip: EVERYTHING CAME TO A HALT. EVERYBODY JUST STOPPED. Narrator: THE GUESTS STEP IN TO HOLD ROB BACK. YOU NEED TO BE ARRESTED. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO BE. Chip: MONICA IS NOT A VIOLENT PERSON AT ALL. LIKE ANYBODY ELSE, SHE CAN BE PUSHED INTO A CORNER. HERE, THE VERBAL ABUSE HAD JUST GONE TO A NEW LEVEL. Narrator: THAT SAME NIGHT, MONICA MOVES OUT OF THEIR MASTER BEDROOM. WHEN MONICA PHYSICALLY ATTACKS ROB, YOU WOULD THINK THAT WAS THE CLUE THAT THEIR MARRIAGE IS TOO DYSFUNCTIONAL AND THEY SHOULD TALK ABOUT DIVORCE, BUT SHE'S NOT READY TO GIVE UP ON THE LIFESTYLE TO WHICH SHE'S BECOME ACCUSTOMED. AND AT SOME LEVEL, THAT DYSFUNCTION IS SOMETHING SHE LIKES. Narrator: SEVERAL WEEKS LATER, ON VALENTINE'S DAY, ROB COMES HOME TO A SPECIAL GIFT WAITING FOR HIM - DIVORCE PAPERS. HEY, WHAT IS THIS? YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT THINGS HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN SMOOTH SAILING LATELY. Monica: IT WAS A HUGE GAMBLE. I HAD NO SUPPORT - MONETARILY OR FAMILY - BUT I FELT LIKE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WHO PUT YOU UP TO THIS? WAS IT YOUR BROTHER? HOW DID ROB REACT TO YOUR TRYING TO LEAVE AND DIVORCE HIM? FURIOUS - I MEAN, WOULD SCREAM AND YELL AND THROW THINGS, STEAL MY CELLPHONES, GO THROUGH ALL OF MY BELONGINGS. I AM NOT SEEING ANYBODY ELSE. I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH - WHAT'S HE LOOKING FOR? HE ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT THERE MUST BE SOMEONE ELSE OR SOMETHING ELSE. AS MUCH AS I TRIED TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND, IT'S - NEITHER EXISTED. I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH HIM. I'M JUST NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU! WHAT'S HIS NAME?! Narrator: ROB MOVES OUT. EIGHT MONTHS LATER, THEIR DIVORCE IS FINALIZED, AND MONICA GETS CUSTODY OF ALEX. Chips: AT FIRST, I WAS SURPRISED THAT SHE LEFT HIM, BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH MONEY HE MADE, UNTIL I FOUND OUT HOW MUCH SHE WAS GOING TO GET - $4,000 A MONTH IN CHILD SUPPORT. ON TOP OF THAT - ALIMONY. Narrator: MONICA'S FINALLY FREE, BUT ROB CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HER. HE CONTINUED TO PURSUE HER FROM THE MINUTE THE INK WAS DRY ON THE DIVORCE PAPERS. THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. REALLY? Narrator: A YEAR AFTER THE DIVORCE, ROB'S JEALOUSY REACHES NEW HEIGHTS WHEN MONICA STARTS DATING A WEALTHY NEUROSURGEON NAMED ALLAN GORDON. Monica: WE DATED AND FELL IN LOVE, AND IT REALLY SEEMED LIKE IT MADE A WHOLE LOT MORE SENSE THAN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT I HAD BEEN THROUGH. SO, MAYBE THREE'S THE CHARM? I WAS HOPING. WE HAD SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON. HE RARELY DRANK. Fox: THE WAY HE TREATED HER - THAT'S WHAT SHE LIKED ABOUT DR. GORDON. AND IT DIDN'T HURT THAT HE HAD MONEY. Narrator: AFTER DATING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, MONICA MOVES IN TO ALLAN'S MANSION WITH ALEX AND DAKOTA. THIS HOUSE HAD ITS OWN TENNIS COURT [CHUCKLES] AND A POOL AND JUST WAS A MONSTROUS HOUSE. [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] WHAT NOW, ROB? Narrator: ROB STILL CALLS ALMOST DAILY. Fox: SHE COULD NOT END THE RELATIONSHIP WITH ROB AS LONG AS HER DAUGHTER WAS IN THE PICTURE. THINGS ARE GOING GREAT. AS LONG AS HE HAD ACCESS TO ALEX, HE HAD ACCESS TO MONICA. Kramer: PUT HER ON THE PHONE BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK TO HER. NO, YOU CAN'T TALK TO HER. IT SOUNDS LIKE ROB IS TRYING TO DESTROY YOUR RELATIONSHIP. UNDERMINE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. SHE'S MY DAUGHTER, OKAY? Fox: HE COULDN'T STAND ANYONE ELSE HAVING HER. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH LOVE. ROB THOUGHT OF MONICA AS HIS POSSESSION. YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP CALLING HERE. Narrator: ROB'S OBSESSION STARTS TO GRATE ON ALLAN. HE FEARS MONICA MAY SECRETLY LIKE THE ATTENTION. BYE, ROB. Monica: ROB WAS VERY JEALOUS. HE SEEMED RATHER COMPETITIVE WITH HIM... YOU WANT TO COME SHOPPING? ...WHICH EVENTUALLY LED DR. GORDON INTO COMPETING BACK WITH ROB. Dr. Jones: SO, THE TWO OF THEM WERE ALMOST VYING FOR YOUR LOVE AND ATTENTION AND AFFECTION? ON A DAILY BASIS. Dr. Jones: MONICA MAY ACT LIKE SHE HATES THE COMPETITION BETWEEN HER NEW BOYFRIEND AND HER EX, BUT, REALLY, PERHAPS IT'S HER FANTASY TO HAVE TWO MEN FIGHTING OVER HER BECAUSE SHE CRAVES ATTENTION, DRAMA, AND EXCITEMENT. Narrator: AFTER TWO YEARS TOGETHER, MONICA AND ALLAN PLAN A FAMILY TRIP TO SAN FRANCISCO. SO EXCITED! THEY'RE GOING FOR A FRIEND'S WEDDING AND TO BUY AN ENGAGEMENT RING FOR MONICA. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PICKING OUT THAT RING. ALLAN PLANS TO JOIN MONICA AND THE GIRLS THERE IN A FEW DAYS. THE TRIP WILL BE A WELCOME REPRIEVE FROM ROB'S CONSTANT BADGERING... OR SO MONICA THINKS. COMING UP, WHEN ROB'S STALKING REACHES NEW HEIGHTS... THIS IS WHAT I GET?! ...IT SENDS MONICA SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL. Narrator: WHEN MONICA FAIRVIEW AND HER BOYFRIEND ALLAN GORDON PLAN A ROMANTIC GETAWAY TO SAN FRANCISCO IN JULY 2009, SHE THINKS IT'LL BE THE TRIP OF A LIFETIME. BUT HER JEALOUS EX-HUSBAND ROB HAS A SURPRISE IN STORE FOR HER. WHO PUT YOU UP TO THIS? WAS IT YOUR BROTHER? DADDY? Monica: WE'RE EXITING THE PLANE. THERE WAS DAD WITH A LIMO FOR THE GIRLS TO GIVE US A RIDE BACK TO THE HOTEL. HEY, GIRLS! THERE'S MY GIRLS. AND IT JUST PUT ME IN A VERY AWKWARD SITUATION. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL? WHAT AM I TRYING TO PULL? I'M TRYING TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH ALEX AND DAKOTA. IF ALAN FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS, HE'S GONNA HIT THE ROOF! THIS IS RIDICULOUS! SO, I ALLOWED THEM TO RIDE WITH HIM IN THE LIMO BACK TO THE HOTEL. FINE. FINE. BUT AFTER YOU DROP US OFF AT THE HOTEL, I WANT YOU ON THE FIRST FLIGHT BACK TO ATLANTA. Narrator: MONICA IS LIVID. SHE'S SICK AND TIRED OF ROB TRYING TO WORM HIS WAY BACK INTO HER LIFE. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] WHEN ALLAN ARRIVES TWO DAYS LATER, MONICA KEEPS ROB'S VISIT A SECRET, AS THE COUPLE CELEBRATE THEIR ENGAGEMENT. OKAY. [ CORK POPS ] WHOO! [ CHUCKLES ] BUT ONCE THEY GET BACK TO ATLANTA, MONICA FEELS LIKE SHE NEEDS TO COME CLEAN TO THE MAN SHE'S GOING TO MARRY. WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S ROB. WHEN THE GIRLS AND I ARRIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO, HE PICKED US UP FROM THE AIRPORT IN A LIMO. ALLAN REACTS BADLY TO MONICA'S CONFESSION. I AM SICK AND... TIRED OF THIS! I WAS JUST EXHAUSTED FROM FIGHTING WITH THE BOTH OF THEM. Narrator: IT'S A HURDLE THE COUPLE CAN'T GET PAST. AND I DECIDED THAT MAYBE THINGS WOULD BE BETTER ON MY OWN. YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO HIM. AND I TOOK MY TWO GIRLS AND MYSELF, AND WE MOVED, THINKING THAT MAYBE THAT WOULD EASE ROB'S JEALOUS TENDENCIES. I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS ANYMORE, EITHER. Narrator: NEWLY SINGLE, MONICA DIVES HEADFIRST INTO ATLANTA'S SOCIALITE SCENE. IT'S KIND OF A SHOW-OFF SCENE. YOU KNOW... PEOPLE BEING SNOTTY, YOU KNOW, THE "WHO'S WHO." [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: MONICA'S FORMER FRIENDS CLAIM THAT SHE BEGINS TO PARTY HARD... YEAH! ...HIGH ON A COMBINATION OF ALCOHOL AND ADDERALL. SHE LOVED THE PARTY SCENE. SHE LOVED THE ATTENTION. Man: TO FRIENDS. AND SHE LOVED THE MONEY. THERE'S A LOT OF DRAMA. THIS ISN'T JUST A REBOUND FROM A FAILED RELATIONSHIP. IT'S REALLY A CLASSIC MIDLIFE CRISIS. SHE'S DRINKING AND PARTYING, CAROUSING AROUND, TRYING TO RECLAIM THE LOST YOUTH THAT SHE NEVER ENJOYED. I'M OKAY. THIS MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME IS SOMETHING THAT CAN ONLY GET MONICA INTO TROUBLE. Narrator: BUT JUST AS MONICA'S ON A ROLL... ROB LOSES EVERYTHING. THE COMPANY HE WAS WORKING FOR BECAME INVOLVED IN A MAJOR LAWSUIT. HE THEN LOST HIS JOB. Narrator: ROB HITS ROCK BOTTOM. WHEN THE MONEY RAN OUT, I THINK THINGS KIND OF WENT TO **** YOU OKAY, BUDDY? YEAH, I'M FINE. JUST GET BACK TO WORK. Narrator: WITHOUT ROB'S SIZEABLE INCOME TO BANKROLL HER, MONICA QUICKLY RUNS INTO FINANCIAL TROUBLE. MONICA HAS SOME LAVISH SPENDING HABITS. IT ALWAYS SEEMED THAT MONICA NEEDED MONEY FOR SOMETHING. Narrator: AS THE BILLS PILE UP... I'M GONNA MAKE A BET. YEAH? IF YOU DON'T MAKE A HOLE IN ONE, I GET $1,000. ...MONICA SETS HER SIGHTS ON RICH, ELIGIBLE MEN. MONICA WOULD, A LOT OF TIMES, ATTACH HERSELF TO OLDER MEN, WEALTHY MEN. [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] Robbins: MONICA DATED HIGH PROFILE. IF THEY COULDN'T GIVE ANYTHING TO MONICA, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM. AND I HAVEN'T HAD MONEY... Narrator: ACCORDING TO MONICA'S FRIENDS, SHE HAS DIFFERENT MEN FOOTING ALL HER BILLS. SHE WAS DATING FIVE GUYS AT THE SAME TIME, BUT SHE WASN'T REALLY DATING THEM. SHE WAS JUST STRINGING THEM ALONG. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE. OH, MY PLEASURE. SHE WAS JUST PLAYING THEM. Narrator: BY MARCH 2011, MONICA'S LONG LINE OF SUGAR DADDIES HAS RUN OUT. LUCKILY, ROB'S MANAGED TO LAND A NEW SALES JOB. MONICA SAW ROB AS A WALKING ATM MACHINE. Narrator: ROB WON'T GIVE MONICA CASH BUT LETS HER AND ALEX STAY WITH HIM. DAKOTA GOES TO LIVE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER IN INDIANA. ONE DAY, MONICA'S FRIEND NADIA GETS A FRONT-ROW SEAT TO THE NASTY DYNAMICS BETWEEN THE EX-LOVERS. GIVE ME THE PHONE SO I CAN KNOW WHO IT IS. GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME. IT GOT TO THE POINT TO WHERE HE WAS HOLDING HER ARMS. MONICA AND ROB ARE IN A CLASSIC CODEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP. SHE'S ATTRACTED TO THE DRAMA OF TRYING TO FIX HIM. HE KNOWS HOW TO PUSH HER BUTTONS. THE PATTERN WILL CONTINUE OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL ONE OF THEM IS BOUND TO EXPLODE. Narrator: MONICA CLAIMS ROB TRIES TO WIN HER AFFECTION BY SURPRISING HER WITH TWO TICKETS TO A ROCK CONCERT. WELL, I GOT THESE. [ GASPS ] ROB EXPECTS MONICA TO TAKE HIM TO THE SHOW. THIS AWESOME. ALEX IS GONNA LOVE THIS! ALEX, YOUR DADDY GOT US TICKETS TO A CONCERT. COOL! I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS, ONCE AGAIN, A TEST IF I WOULD ASK HIM TO GO WITH ME. THANKS! Narrator: ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, THE DAY OF THE CONCERT... YOU TWO HAVE A GOOD TIME. THANKS. ...AFTER ROB LEAVES, MONICA TELLS ALEX THAT SHE'S CHANGED HER MIND. MONICA DECIDED NOT TO TAKE HER BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO BE A BIG SCENE. YOU HAVE THE WHOLE PLACE TO YOURSELF. MONICA DIDN'T WANT ALEX TO BE AROUND THE PARTY GROUP. Narrator: ROB'S OUT AT A BAR WATCHING FOOTBALL. MONICA LEAVES ALEX HOME ALONE AND TAKES A FRIEND TO THE CONCERT. SWEETIE. WHERE'S MOM? Narrator: ROB COMES HOME LATE. HE'S BEEN DRINKING AND DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE FINDS. SHE WANTED ME TO STAY HOME ALONE. SHE WENT TO THE CONCERT WITH HER FRIEND? YEAH. SHE LEFT YOU HERE. HE WAS VERY JEALOUS AND ENRAGED. MY DAUGHTER STARTED TEXTING ME. ...THAT LEAVES HER DAUGHTER AT HOME? "OH, MY GOSH, DAD'S HOME. "HE'S MAD. HE'S CALLING YOU NAMES. HE'S BREAKING THINGS. I'M SCARED." THIS IS WHAT I GET?! "PLEASE HURRY. COME HOME." IT WAS JUST ONE TEXT RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER, AFTER ANOTHER, AFTER ANOTHER... [ CELLPHONE CHIMES ] ...SO I WENT STRAIGHT HOME. Narrator: MONICA ALSO GETS A TEXT FROM ROB, SAYING THAT HE'S KICKING HER OUT OF THE HOUSE. AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF DRAMA AND AGONY, MONICA CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. [ CELLPHONE CHIMES ] WITH ALCOHOL AND ADDERALL IN HER SYSTEM, MONICA HEADS BACK TO ROB'S CONDO. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] HOW DO YOU PLAN ON HANDLING THIS? BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BEFORE YOU WALK INTO IT. HOW ARE YOU GONNA DIAL HIM DOWN? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAD PLANNED TO DIAL HIM DOWN. [ Voice breaking ] I PLANNED TO LET HIM END IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE THE DAY-TO-DAY LIFE STRUGGLE WAS SO HARD THAT I JUST IMAGINED MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE EASIER... AND BETTER WITHOUT ME. MONICA CLAIMS HER INTENTION IS TO MAKE ROB SO MAD HE KILLS HER. I HAD IMAGINED, BY CONFRONTING HIM AND SPEAKING UP TO HIM, THAT HE WOULD JUST BEAT ME TO DEATH. JUST SHUT UP! YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU WERE GOING TO PROVOKE HIM UNTIL HE SNAPPED? YES. WHO THE HELL... WHEN MONICA ARRIVES HOME, SHE SEES ROB IN THE SHARED COURTYARD OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT LEFT ALEX HOME ALONE. THIS IS HER VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. OH, LIKE YOU'RE ANY BETTER TO BE AROUND HER, YOU DRUNKEN SON OF A BITCH?! YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE? Monica: [ Voice breaking ] I CALLED HIM NAMES. HE IMMEDIATELY OVERPOWERED ME AND THEN SPUN ME AROUND AND HAD ME IN A HEADLOCK. BUT I WAS DETERMINED JUST TO CONTINUE SAYING ALL THE THINGS THAT I WASN'T ALLOWED TO SAY. AND YOU MAKE ME WANT TO PUKE. LET ME GO! LET ME GO! LET ME GO! [ GRUNTING ] Narrator: ACCORDING TO MONICA, THIS LEVEL OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS NEW. [ GRUNTS ] I WAS SCARED THAT... I WAS REALLY GONNA PAY NOW, SO I RAN BACK INSIDE. ALEX? OH, MY GOD. I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA KILL YOU. Narrator: SHE CLAIMS THAT INSIDE THE APARTMENT, ALEX IS FREAKED OUT. AND IT JUST REMINDED ME THAT I DIDN'T GET AWAY. I DID EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED ME TO - I RAN RIGHT BACK INTO THE CAVE WHERE HE WAS GONNA KEEP US. YOU HAVE THIS EPIPHANY THAT YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY? YES, AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT HE DID HAVE A KNIFE. MONICA REALIZES THERE'S ANOTHER WAY OUT - ROB'S KNIFE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SO, I WENT BACK OUT... STAY HERE. FOR MORE ON HOW MONICA IS DOING NOW, YOU'RE A MONEY-GRUBBING BITCH! Narrator: SEPTEMBER 25, 2011. ATLANTA, GEORGIA. IT'S OUR MONEY! WE'RE MARRIED! AFTER BEING ON THE LOSING END OF A POWER STRUGGLE WITH HER EX-HUSBAND FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, MONICA FAIRVIEW HAS REACHED HER BREAKING POINT. SHE CLAIMS SHE'S READY TO KILL HERSELF. ARE YOU SERIOUS WHEN YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE IN FRONT OF HIM? ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. STAY HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SO I WENT BACK OUTSIDE TO DO JUST THAT. [ PANTING ] [ Voice breaking ] I WANTED HIM TO SEE IT. I AM SO SICK OF YOU, ROB! STOP IT! THAT WAS THE EXTENT THAT I WOULD GO TO... TO MAKE THE FIGHTING STOP. [ GRUNTS ] BUT WE STRUGGLED FOR THE KNIFE, AND I FELT FLESH CONTACT. AAH! [ GROANS ] YOU STABBED HIM? YES. MONICA'S STORY THAT SHE WAS GOING OUTSIDE TO CONFRONT ROB TO PUSH HIS BUTTONS AND PROVOKE HIM INTO KILLING HER IN FRONT OF HER DAUGHTER IS COMPLETELY FARFETCHED. IT WOULD TRAUMATIZE ANY CHILD FOR LIFE. Narrator: WITNESSES AT THE SCENE TELL A VERY DIFFERENT STORY. KATHERINE YOUNG IS AT A FRIEND'S APARTMENT, SITTING ON THE BALCONY ACROSS FROM ROB'S PLACE WHEN MONICA COMES STORMING OUT. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LEARN IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU?! IT'S ABOUT HER! SHE WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO HIM AND STARTED HITTING HIM. SHE THREW HER PURSE AT HIM AND THEN STARTED SCREAMING AT HIM. STUPID SON OF A BITCH! [ GRUNTS ] I HAVE NEVER HATED ANYONE AS MUCH AS I HATE YOU! Kramer: SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Narrator: ACCORDING TO KATHERINE, MONICA'S THE AGGRESSOR, AND ROB DOESN'T FIGHT BACK. ACTUALLY, HE WENT DOWN ON HIS KNEES, COVERING HIS FACE, 'CAUSE SHE KEPT HITTING HIM IN THE FACE. SHE WAS HITTING HIM, KICKING HIM. HE NEVER LAID HIS HANDS ON HER. Narrator: KATHERINE CALLS 911. SHE AND HER FRIEND ARE COMPLETELY STUNNED BY WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. LEAVE US ALONE! SHE WENT INSIDE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU STAY RIGHT THERE. AND SHE CAME BACK OUT. STOP, MOM! STOP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! AND ALL SHE DID WAS WALK UP, STAB HIM IN THE BACK. I WANT YOU OUT OF MY LIFE! [ GRUNTS ] AAH! I WOULD SAY SHE'S A CRAZY PERSON. STOP IT! THE DAUGHTER SAW THE WHOLE THING. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: MONICA IS ARRESTED ON THE SPOT. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] ROB IS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL. [ SIREN WAILS ] HE COULD BARELY TALK. HE HAD BLOOD POURING OUT OF HIM. Narrator: DOCTORS DISCOVER THAT THE KNIFE NEARLY SLICED ROB'S SPINAL CORD AND MISSED HIS AORTA BY 1/8 OF AN INCH. ROB'S RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL FOUR DAYS LATER. BY THE TIME HE GETS OUT, MONICA IS FREE ON BAIL. INCREDIBLY, INSTEAD OF BEING ANGRY WITH HER, ROB TRIES, YET AGAIN, TO RECONCILE WITH HER. I FEEL LIKE IF YOU WERE STABBED, YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT, YOU KNOW? YOU WOULDN'T HANG OUT WITH SOMEONE WHO STABBED YOU. IF THAT WAS THE CASE, HE HAS TO BE GUILTY OF SOMETHING. HE KNEW, DEEP DOWN IN HIS MIND THAT HE HAD HURT HER IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO CAUSE THIS, AND HE WANTED TO HELP HER. REMEMBER THAT PLACE? Narrator: CHIP IS SHOCKED TO SEE ROB AND MONICA TOGETHER AFTER THE STABBING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? BUT MONICA HOPES THAT IF SHE HANGS OUT WITH HIM, ROB WON'T TESTIFY AGAINST HER. EVERYTHING'S FINE. I LOVE HER. Chip: I SAID, "WHY ARE YOU TWO EVEN AROUND EACH OTHER?" AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "BECAUSE I WANT HER BACK IN MY LIFE, AND I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO KEEP HER FROM GOING TO JAIL." YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. WHAT IS THIS? Narrator: BUT THIS STORY DOESN'T HAVE A HAPPY ENDING. THE COUPLE SOON SPLITS UP AGAIN. 18 MONTHS AFTER THE STABBING, ON MARCH 22, 2013, ROB TESTIFIES AGAINST MONICA. SHE'S FOUND GUILTY OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT. MONICA IS SENTENCED TO EIGHT YEARS IN PRISON. Dr. Jones: THE REALLY SAD THING ABOUT MONICA IS THAT SHE REALLY HAS BECOME AN EMOTIONAL VOID. SHE HAS COVERED UP HER FEELINGS FOR SO LONG, SHE ONLY KNOWS HOW TO SAY THE WORDS, "I'M SORRY." BUT SHE'S COMPLETELY INCAPABLE OF FEELING IT. Narrator: MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE ROB WILL STILL BE WAITING FOR MONICA WHEN SHE GETS OUT. IF SHE GOT OUT OF JAIL RIGHT NOW AND ASKED HIM TO BE WITH HER, HE WOULD - THE MOMENT SHE'S OUT OF JAIL. Narrator: MONICA IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON HER APPEAL. SHE CLAIMS TO HAVE NO HARD FEELINGS BUT INSISTS SHE AND ROB ARE THROUGH. NEVER TOUCH ME AGAIN! Monica: I DON'T WISH ANY HARM ON HIM NOW. [ Voice breaking ] THAT'S STILL THE FATHER OF MY DAUGHTER. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
