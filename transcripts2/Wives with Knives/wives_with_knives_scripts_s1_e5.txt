 I WAS ONE OF THE THOSE STUBBORN TEENAGERS AT ONE POINT WHERE I DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN TO MY MOM. I WANTED TO MAKE MY OWN MISTAKES AND LIVE HOW I WANT. SARAH! SARAH! KAYLA NEEDS HER BREAKFAST. I GOT TO GO TO WORK. SARAH! NOW! THE NEXT MORNING, HUNGOVER AND TIRED, SARAH TAKES A HARD LOOK AT HER LIFE. SHE KNOWS SHE CAN'T KEEP PARTYING WHILE RAISING A CHILD. SHE MAKES A PLEDGE TO HERSELF TO BECOME A RESPONSIBLE PARENT. AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT THAN TO SNAG A HUSBAND? I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE PAST RELATIONSHIPS, AND I WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW, WELL, I'VE BEEN GOING AFTER LOOKS, "PEOPLE AROUND MY AGE. WELL, MAYBE I NEED TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT." SARAH WASTES NO TIME HUNTING DOWN MR. RIGHT. THERE ARE, LIKE, NO BABES HERE TONIGHT. NO ONE? WHAT ABOUT THE BOUNCER? HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. ONE NIGHT AT A LOCAL POOL HALL, SHE LAYS EYES ON 33-YEAR-OLD TOMMY SHACKELFORD AND TURNS ON THE FLIRT. HI. HEY. I-I'M SARAH. TOMMY. TOMMY. NICE TO MEET YOU. YEAH, SHE WAS THE ONE THAT APPROACHED ME. SHE SAID, "I LIKE YOU. CAN WE GO OUT? CAN WE DATE?" AND I AGREED, AND THAT'S HOW IT STARTED. HERE, YOU JUST GO... HE WASN'T THE BEST-LOOKING MAN IN THE WORLD, BUT HE WAS EYE-CATCHING. OH, I LIKE THAT. I'M KEEPING MY EYE ON YOU. EVERY TIME HE WALKED AROUND AND SAW ME, HE WOULD SMILE. I WOULD SMILE BACK. SHE SEEMED SO SWEET, INNOCENT. SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL TO ME. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU AROUND. FOR THE PAST 11 YEARS, TOMMY'S HAD A STEADY JOB AS A CORRECTIONS OFFICER AT A NEARBY PRISON. HE ALSO WORKS AS A BOUNCER ON THE WEEKENDS FOR EXTRA CASH. TO SARAH, HE LOOKS LIKE PRIME HUSBAND MATERIAL. THE WAY HE TALKED, IT WAS LIKE HE HAD IT ALL THERE, YOU KNOW - HIS DUCKS IN A ROW. BORN AND RAISED? YOU KNOW IT. ME, TOO! BUT TO SARAH'S MOM, TOMMY'S AGE IS AN ISSUE. HE'S 13 YEARS OLDER THAN SARAH. I DIDN'T LIKE IT THAT HE WAS SO MUCH OLDER. THOUGHT, "MAYBE IT'LL BE GOOD FOR HER, YOU KNOW, "TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S AT LEAST DECENT. SHOULD WE GET OUT OF HERE? YEAH. LET'S GO. "HE GOT A GOOD JOB, AND MAYBE SHE CAN BE HAPPY WITH SOMEBODY OLDER." DR. CASEY JORDAN STUDIES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. BY THE TIME SHE'S 19, SARAH IS AT A CROSSROADS. SHE'S A HIGH-SCHOOL DROPOUT WITHOUT A REAL JOB AND BASICALLY NO IMPENDING FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO. SO, WHEN SHE MEETS TOMMY, HE'S A REAL ADULT. THIS GIVES HER A NEWFOUND HOPE. OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, THEIR ROMANCE BLOOMS. HI! HEY. TOMMY FAWNS OVER SARAH. HE FILLS A VOID THAT'S BEEN MISSING ALL HER LIFE. DID YOU HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FATHER IN YOUR EARLY CHILDHOOD YEARS? I DID. IT WAS KIND OF WHEN HE PICKED AND CHOOSED THEM. I ACTUALLY EVEN CALLED MYSELF A DADDY'S GIRL, BECAUSE - I DON'T KNOW - I LOVED HIS ATTENTION. AND THEN IT JUST STARTED BACKING OFF. AS A YOUNG TEEN, SARAH REPLACES HER FATHER WITH ANY GUY SHE CAN ATTRACT. SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO TRY TOO HARD. WHEN ALL EYES WERE ON HER, SHE FELT A SENSE OF SATISFACTION THAT SHE DIDN'T FEEL IN ANY OTHER AREA OF HER LIFE, AND IT WOULD LEAD TO A CHRONIC BEHAVIOR THAT WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR ATTENTION. I EVEN LIKED IF THEY TOLD ME WHAT TO DO 'CAUSE IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE I HAD SOME SORT OF MAN FIGURE IN MY LIFE. I, UH, I HAVEN'T BEEN FEELING TOO GOOD. AND? AT 15, SARAH WINDS UP PREGNANT BY A GUY WHO HAS NO INTEREST IN BEING A DAD. I'M NOT GETTING AN ABORTION. THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. I REALLY WASN'T READY TO HAVE A CHILD, AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN ABORTIONS. SARAH STRUGGLES WITH THE BURDEN OF BEING A TEEN MOM. WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?! SARAH HAD A CHILD VERY YOUNG AND DECIDED SHE WANTED TO BE A TEENAGER AND NOT A MOM, SO I TOLD HER IT'S NOT A PART-TIME POSITION. DAMN IT, SARAH. SARAH'S MOM TAKES CUSTODY OF BABY KAYLA. TWO YEARS LATER, SARAH GETS PREGNANT AGAIN BY A DIFFERENT GUY. THIS TIME, SHE ASKS HER SISTER TO ADOPT THE BABY. OH, MY GOD! AFTER HAVING THE SECOND CHILD AND MAKING THE VERY WISE DECISION TO GIVE THAT BOY UP FOR ADOPTION TO HER SISTER, SHE SEEMED TO BE ON THE RIGHT PATH. NOW AT 19, SARAH'S FOUND A REAL MAN IN TOMMY, WHO SHOWERS HER WITH GIFTS AND AFFECTION. WE WERE GONNA GO OUT TO A LAKE, AND WE WERE JUST GONNA RELAX AND DRINK SOME CHAMPAGNE AND LISTEN TO THE RADIO. AND A RAINSTORM COME UP, AND MY FAVORITE SONG IS "THE DANCE" BY GARTH BROOKS. WELL, I HAD THAT CD IN MY TRUCK. SO, IT WAS RAINING, AND I PUT IN THE SONG, STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN, AND I WALKED AROUND, GOT HER OUT OF THE TRUCK. NO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AND WE DANCED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. AND SHE JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS THE BEST THING. HE'S A MAN AND HE HAS A JOB AND AN INCOME, AND SHE IS A GIRL WITH NO FUTURE. HE LIKES THE IDEA THAT HE CAN RESCUE HER, AND IT ACTUALLY MAKES HIM EXTREMELY PROUD TO DO THINGS FOR HER WHICH ELEVATE HER TO HIS STANDARDS. EIGHT MONTHS INTO THE RELATIONSHIP, SARAH DISCOVERS SHE'S PREGNANT YET AGAIN. BUT THIS TIME, IT'S DIFFERENT. TOMMY IS FIRED UP BY THE NEWS OF THE BABY. THE COUPLE MOVE IN TOGETHER AND CREATE THEIR DREAM HOME. THEY COMPLETE THEIR FAMILY PORTRAIT BY HAVING SARAH'S DAUGHTER, KAYLA, AND TOMMY'S 9-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, AMY, STAY WITH THEM ON WEEKENDS. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I LOVE IT. FEELING LIKE HER LIFE IS FINALLY COMING TOGETHER, SARAH'S IN HEAVEN. I WANT TO PUT PLANTS ALL ALONG HERE. I ATE IT UP. I LOVED IT. I DID. AND, IN A WAY, I WAS ACTUALLY SCARED, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I WASN'T USED TO IT AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE IT, BUT I DIDN'T WANT IT TO GO NOWHERE. ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE? VERY MUCH SO. I EVEN SAID THAT QUITE A FEW TIMES. I SAID THAT. THAT WOULD BE SO NICE. SURE ENOUGH, IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR SARAH'S BUBBLE TO BURST. COMING UP... SARAH DISCOVERS SOMETHING SINISTER ABOUT TOMMY'S PAST THAT COULD DESTROY HER PERFECT, NEW FAMILY. WHAT IS HE DOING IN THAT PHOTO WITH HER? 20-YEAR-OLD SINGLE MOM SARAH SAUNDERS THINKS 33-YEAR-OLD TOMMY SHACKELFORD IS THE MAN OF HER DREAMS. EIGHT MONTHS AFTER MEETING, SHE'S PREGNANT AND MOVING IN. IT'S THE START OF WHAT SHE THINKS IS HER "HAPPILY EVER AFTER". BUT JUST TWO WEEKS LATER, WHILE VISITING FAMILY IN VIRGINIA, SARAH MAKES A SHOCKING DISCOVERY. TOMMY HAS BEEN HIDING SOME DISTURBING DETAILS ABOUT HIS PAST. MAMA, THAT'S TOMMY. I WAS AT A FAMILY MEMBER'S HOUSE GOING THROUGH PICTURES, AND I CAME ACROSS A PICTURE OF TOMMY AND ONE OF MY AUNTS. SARAH'S MOM, AMELIA, HASN'T MET TOMMY YET, BUT SHE RECOGNIZES THE MAN IN THE PHOTO. THE POINT IS - WHAT IS HE DOING IN THAT PHOTO WITH HER? THE PICTURE WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS HER DADDY'S SISTER. AND I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH, SARAH. THAT IS YOUR AUNT'S EX-HUSBAND." WELL, THAT'S YOUR AUNT KATHLEEN. HE'S HER EX. SARAH'S STUNNED TO FIND OUT THAT TOMMY WAS MARRIED TO HER AUNT. EVEN WORSE, AMELIA TELLS HER THAT TOMMY HAS BEEN MARRIED THREE TIMES AND IS KNOWN FOR BEING A WOMANIZER. THEY WARNED ME, TRYING TO TELL ME THAT HE WAS A VERY CONTROLLING MAN. HER? SO GROSS. WHEN SHE GETS BACK TO NORTH CAROLINA, SARAH CALLS TOMMY OUT ON HIS SECRETS. WHEN I WAS BACK THERE, I FOUND THIS. THAT'S MY EX-WIFE. THAT'S MY AUNT KATHLEEN. WELL, AFTER I CONFRONTED HIM, HE SAID, "I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED YOU." LIKE, I DON'T KNOW IF HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW, OR IF HE JUST TRIED TO PLAY IT OFF, BUT IT WAS KIND OF CRAZY. NOW WITH TOMMY'S PAST OUT IN THE OPEN, SARAH WANTS HIM OUT OF HER LIFE. I'M GONNA BE AT MY MOTHER'S. HONEY. TOMMY IS HEARTBROKEN, BUT HE'S DETERMINED TO WIN HER BACK. SARAH! COME ON, SARAH. OPEN THE DOOR. SARAH, I'M SORRY. THAT BABY IS GONNA NEED A MOMMY AND A DADDY. COME HOME WITH ME. THE MORE WE TALKED AND THE MORE HE CONVINCED ME THAT IT SHOULDN'T MATTER... I ACTUALLY THOUGHT, FOR SOME REASON, I WOULD BE THE ONE TO KIND OF STRAIGHTEN UP TOMMY. I MISSED YOU. I MISSED YOU. TO SARAH, IT WAS HER NAIVETÃ© BLINDING HER FROM THE SIGNS THAT THIS MAN IS BEING COVERT AND SECRETIVE AND KEEPING VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT OTHER GIRLS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW BEFORE THEY GO WHOLE-HOG INTO A RELATIONSHIP. SARAH MOVES BACK IN, AND THE COUPLE RETURN TO SETTING UP HOUSE, EAGERLY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR BABY. DO YOU WANT SOME HELP? I WOULD LOVE SOME HELP. SARAH FANTASIZES THAT IT'LL BE THE HAPPIEST TIME OF HER LIFE. WERE YOU THINKING HE COULD BE A GOOD DAD? IT SEEMS A LITTLE WOBBLY. I DID. I REALLY DID. OKAY. THANK YOU, BABY. THANK - OH, YOU CAN FEEL THIS. IS IT KICKING? YES. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE, SARAH FEELS READY TO BE A MOM. AND IN APRIL 2005, SHE GIVES BIRTH TO A HEALTHY BABY BOY THEY NAME MASON. BUT INSTEAD OF THE JOY SHE EXPECTED... ...SHE FEELS DRAINED AND DEPRESSED. SHE CAN BARELY GET OUT OF BED, LET ALONE CARE FOR THE BABY. AFTER I HAD MY SON, I HAD THE - POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. YEAH. A PSYCHIATRIST PRESCRIBES MEDICATION TO HELP HER COPE WITH HER SYMPTOMS. I WAS ON ANXIETY MEDICINE. WHEN I WAS SAD, IT WOULD PUT ME IN A LITTLE BIT OF A BETTER MOOD. BUT WHEN SARAH STARTS POPPING PILLS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY, SHE QUICKLY GETS ADDICTED. I FOUND OUT THAT IT HELPED NUMB EMOTIONAL PAIN ALSO. I GOT ADDICTED REALLY BAD. SARAH TRIES TO HIDE HER ADDICTION FROM TOMMY, BUT PRETTY SOON, HE CATCHES ON. SHE COULDN'T FUNCTION PROPERLY. THERE WAS JUST THINGS THAT SHE DID, LIKE SHE STUMBLED, ALMOST FELL, WITH OUR SON. AND THAT'S WHEN I DREW THE LINE. TOMMY CONFIDES IN SARAH'S MOM, AND TOGETHER, THEY STAGE AN INTERVENTION. HEY, MAMA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THERE SHOULD BE ABOUT 40 PILLS IN HERE. AND THERE AIN'T. UM... I HAD DROPPED... A LOT OF THEM. SARAH, NO. AND I HAD TO THROW THEM OUT, SO I COULDN'T - HONEY, WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. HE GAVE THEM TO ME TO HELP ME HELP THE BABY. SARAH. HEY. YOU NEED TO GET SOME HELP, OR MASON'S COMING TO STAY WITH ME. WHAT? YEAH. IT'S A TOUGH ULTIMATUM. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? WE WANT YOU TO GET SOME HELP. WHEN SARAH FINDS HERSELF DEPENDENT ON DRUGS FOLLOWING THE BIRTH OF HER SON, IT'S TOMMY WHO ORCHESTRATES AN INTERVENTION AND TELLS HER SHE NEEDS TO CLEAN UP HER ACT. AND SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE HAS HER BEST INTERESTS IN MIND, BUT THIS LEAVES HER FEELING DISEMPOWERED AND PERHAPS IN HIS DEBT. LET GO OF THIS CRAP! YOU DON'T NEED IT. I WANTED ME AND HER TO MAKE IT, AND FOR US TO MAKE IT, SHE COULDN'T BE ADDICTED TO PILLS. SHE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BE A GOOD MOTHER AND A WIFE. OKAY? OKAY. YOU'RE GONNA GET SOME HELP. FINALLY, SARAH RELENTS AND AGREES TO GET HELP. FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS, SHE MANAGES TO STAY CLEAN AND FOCUSED ON BEING A GOOD MOM. IT SEEMS LIKE SARAH AND TOMMY ARE BACK ON TRACK. AND IN NOVEMBER 2008, AFTER FIVE YEARS TOGETHER, TOMMY DECIDES HE WANTS TO MAKE THEIR RELATIONSHIP LEGIT. YES! WILL YOU MARRY ME, SARAH? YES! YES! YES! OH, MY. WA-WA-WAIT! I HAVE TO THROW MY BOUQUET! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY? GET READY NOW. JUST THREE MONTHS AFTER TOMMY PROPOSES, THE COUPLE TIES THE KNOT. THEY SEEMED VERY HAPPY AND CONTENT AND READY TO MAKE A LIFE TOGETHER. I WAS OKAY WITH WELCOMING HIM AS A SON-IN-LAW, YOU KNOW, AND BEING MARRIED TO HER. AT FIRST, THE NEWLYWEDS SEEM HAPPY AND IN LOVE. BUT WHAT TOMMY DOESN'T KNOW IS THAT HIS NEW WIFE IS HARBORING A SECRET THAT COULD CRUSH THEIR MARRIAGE. SARAH'S DRUG HABIT IS BACK. SHE'S SECRETLY SEEING PSYCHIATRISTS AND GETTING MULTIPLE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER. BEFORE LONG, SHE LAPSES BACK INTO HARDCORE ADDICTION. SHE WAS ADDICTED TO PILLS, AND I DIDN'T SEE IT THE SECOND GO-AROUND BECAUSE I WOULDN'T TOLERATE IT, AND SHE KNEW THAT. SARAH'S ADDICTION CONSUMES HER, AND SHE BEGINS TO UNRAVEL. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, MONEY IS TIGHT, EVEN WITH TOMMY WORKING FULL-TIME. IT WENT DOWNHILL. OUR BILLS STARTED GETTING BEHIND. TOMMY TELLS SARAH SHE NEEDS TO GET A JOB TO MAKE ENDS MEET, BUT THE DRUGS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD ON TO STEADY WORK. TOMMY REACHES HIS BREAKING POINT. SERIOUSLY? WHAT THE HELL, SARAH? YOU'RE JUST SITTING AROUND WATCHING TV ALL DAY, HUH? KICK YOUR FEET UP. SHE WOULDN'T KEEP A JOB LONG, AND IT GOT FRUSTRATING. WE STILL MADE IT, BUT IT GOT FRUSTRATING. YOU NEED TO GET OUT AND GET A JOB. A REAL JOB! OH, YOU'RE JUST GONNA WALK AWAY FROM ME, HUH? SARAH, COME BACK HERE. NO! SARAH. NO! COME BACK HERE. THE FINANCIAL STRAIN TAKES YET ANOTHER TOLL ON THE COUPLE'S FRAGILE RELATIONSHIP. SARAH! OPEN THE DOOR! ACCORDING TO SARAH, EACH FIGHT WITH TOMMY LEAVES ANOTHER EMOTIONAL SCAR. COME ON! HE WOULD SAY THINGS TO TEAR YOU DOWN. YEAH. AND ACTUALLY, HE ACTED LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE GOT OFF ON IT. OPEN THE DOOR! AT THIS STAGE IN THEIR MARRIAGE, TOMMY AND SARAH HAD RACKED UP QUITE A BIT OF DEBT, AND SO, HE STARTED TO ACTUALLY DISPLACE THE BLAME ONTO SARAH - AFTER ALL, IF SHE HAD A FULL-TIME JOB, THEY WOULDN'T BE IN THIS TERRIBLE CONUNDRUM. SARAH ACCEPTS ALL OF THIS BLAME AND TRIES TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT SHE CAN AGAIN ELEVATE HERSELF TO A POSITION WHERE TOMMY WILL LOVE HER AND STOP BERATING HER FOR BEING A FAILURE. WITH HER MOTHER'S HELP, SARAH GETS ODD JOBS CLEANING HOUSES. I JUST WANTED A LITTLE PEACE. NO WORRYING ABOUT BILLS. NO WORRYING ABOUT HAVING TO ASK MY MAMA FOR MONEY. BUT HER MEAGER PAY CAN'T MAKE A DENT IN THEIR DEBT. SHE'S NOW SO DESPERATE, SHE'S ABOUT TO CROSS A LINE SHE'S NEVER CROSSED BEFORE. COMING UP... TO WHAT LENGTHS IS THIS YOUNG WIFE WILLING TO GO TO END HER NIGHTMARE? I WAS LIKE, "IF HE WOULD JUST SLEEP, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO HEAR HIS MOUTH." WHOO! TOMMY AND SARAH SHACKELFORD'S TWO-YEAR MARRIAGE IS SUFFERING THANKS TO A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT AND SARAH'S SECRET DRUG ADDICTION. SARAH'S HABIT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD DOWN A GOOD PAYING JOB. THE BEST SHE CAN MANAGE IS BRINGING IN A FEW DOLLARS CLEANING HOUSES. ONE DAY, SARAH DECIDES TO TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT AND POCKETS A $50,000 RING FROM ONE OF HER WEALTHY CLIENTS. DID YOU TRULY THINK, SARAH, THAT YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH IT? DEEP DOWN, UM, I KNEW I WASN'T GONNA GET AWAY WITH IT. BUT I WAS DESPERATE - ASHAMED BUT DESPERATE. SHE LOOKS AT THE RING - IMPULSIVELY TAKES IT, MORE AS AN IMPLOSION. MORE AS JUST KIND OF, "I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE HERE. "THINGS ARE SO BAD AT HOME THAT I'M GONNA TAKE THIS RING "AND IT'S GONNA EITHER SOLVE THINGS "OR PUSH US OVER THE EDGE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION, BUT SOMETHING'S GOT TO BREAK." LATER THAT DAY, SARAH TAKES THE RING TO A LOCAL PAWNSHOP. SHE'S GOT NO IDEA HOW VALUABLE IT IS... WHAT YOU GOT THERE? ...AND ACCEPTS JUST $300. SARAH HOPES THE EXTRA CASH WILL GET TOMMY OFF HER BACK. I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR HIS MOUTH ANYMORE, JUST FOR ONE DAY. THERE YOU GO. GREAT. THANKS. BUT A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER, THE WEALTHY CLIENT CALLS SARAH TO ASK IF SHE'S SEEN THE MISSING RING. OH, NO, MA'AM. I HAVEN'T SEEN A RING. SARAH DENIES KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BUT GUILT EATS AWAY AT HER. I HAD ACTUALLY GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH HER, AND I CALLED HER BACK AND I JUST KNEW I COULDN'T DO IT NO MORE 'CAUSE IT'S NOT ME. SO, I CONFESSED TO HER. HI. IT'S ME, AGAIN. I- I DO KNOW WHERE THAT RING IS. SHE WANTED TO PRESS CHARGES. AND THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING I COULD DO BUT TELL HER, "I UNDERSTAND." THE CLIENT REPORTS HER TO THE POLICE, AND SARAH HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO CALL TOMMY. HELLO? HI. I- I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO PICK ME UP. FROM THE POLICE STATION. SHE WAS MY HOUSE CLEANER. WE HAPPEN TO BE MISSING SOME JEWELRY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! THE NEWS DOES NOT GO OVER WELL. $50,000?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND?! AND I TOLD HER, "I'M TIRED OF YOU MESSING UP. "EVERY TIME WE GET OUR LIFE GOING GOOD, YOU DO SOMETHING SO STUPID TO SCREW IT UP." THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. NO. HE JUST KEPT YELLING AT ME, "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU. "YOU'RE SO SORRY. YOU WOULD SCREW UP." WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO US? AFTER SHE SPENDS A NIGHT IN JAIL, TOMMY BAILS SARAH OUT. SHE'S ORDERED TO APPEAR IN COURT IN TWO MONTHS. IF CONVICTED, SHE COULD FACE FOUR TO SIX MONTHS BEHIND BARS. YOU STOLE A DAMN RING! A $50,000 RING! YOU HAVE TO GET US A LAWYER. FIND YOURSELF A WAY OUT OF THIS. I THOUGHT THAT IF SHE WENT TO JAIL, MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE HER SEE THAT SHE CAN'T KEEP DOING THINGS AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT. SARAH WAS STEALING A RING TO PAWN IT TO BRING ENOUGH MONEY HOME TO BUY PEACE IN THE HOUSEHOLD? THE INFERENCE OF THIS WAS MORE THAN HE COULD HANDLE. HE WASN'T A GOOD PROVIDER OR A GOOD HUSBAND? THAT WAS HIS ACHILLES' HEEL. YOU ARE GONNA LEARN YOUR DAMN LESSON! TAKE ME HOME. SARAH IS DEVASTATED BY TOMMY'S LACK OF SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT, LITTLE MAN. LAY IT ON ME. SCHOOL STARTS AT... HE RUBS IT IN HER FACE BY OPENLY TALKING ABOUT HOW HE AND MASON WILL GET BY WITHOUT HER WHEN SHE'S IN PRISON. WHY CAN'T MOM JUST PICK ME UP? YOUR MOM'S GONNA GO AWAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE. WE'LL MAKE IT WORK OUT. YOU GOT FOOTBALL. WHEN IS THAT? HE ATTACKED SARAH AT HER POINT OF WEAKNESS, WHICH WAS, OF COURSE, THEIR SON. SARAH'S LIFE WAS SO VOID THAT HER LOVE FOR HER SON, HER STATUS AS A MOTHER, WAS ALL SHE HAD. SHE LOVED HER SON MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF. HEARING TOMMY PLANNING FOR LIFE WITHOUT HER IS MORE THAN SARAH CAN TAKE. WHAT SHE REALLY WANTS IS TO RUN AWAY WITH HER SON. I TRIED TO LEAVE. I WOULD TRY TO GET ME AND MY SON OUT OF THERE, AND HE WOULD FIND WHERE I WAS. AND FIRST THING HE WOULD THREATEN IS, "I'M TAKING YOU TO COURT FOR OUR SON." SO NO MATTER WHAT, HE WAS GONNA GET YOU BACK. HE ALWAYS MADE ME THINK SO. BETWEEN THE THOUGHT OF PRISON, HER DRUG HABIT, AND TOMMY'S THREATS, SHE FEARS LOSING HER SON FOREVER. NO, YOU DON'T. NO, YOU DON'T! YOU SEE THIS? NO MORE DRUGS, SARAH! NOW, YOU BETTER HEAR ME, AND YOU BETTER HEAR ME GOOD. DO YOU THINK YOU ARE EVER GONNA LEAVE ME?! YOU JUNKIE! YOU DON'T GET MY SON! YOU ARE NEVER TAKING HIM AWAY FROM ME. NEVER! IT WAS WORTH PUTTING UP WITH TOMMY JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T LOSE YOUR SON. YEAH. MY KID, MY SON, AND YOU ARE NOT TAKING HIM FROM ME. "MY SON. "HE'S MY SON. HE'S NOT GONNA LIVE WITH A DOPE-ADDICT." IT BECAME A DAILY THING. YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND TRY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SARAH FEELS MORE TRAPPED THAN EVER. NEVER FORGET THAT SARAH REALLY HAD NO LIFE, NO IDENTITY, OUTSIDE OF HER MOTHERHOOD. AND WHEN TOMMY THREATENS HER AND SAYS, "YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR CHILD AGAIN," THIS DESTROYS HER - HITS HER AT HER VERY CORE BECAUSE IT'S ALL SHE HAS TO LIVE FOR. TO HER, THERE'S ONLY ONE PATH TO FREEDOM... SHE WILL DO ANYTHING TO MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T LOSE THAT CHILD. ...AND SHE'S DESPERATE ENOUGH TO TAKE IT. I MADE UP MY MIND WHAT I WAS GONNA DO. ON THE EVENING OF FRIDAY, MAY 13, 2011, SARAH FIXES DINNER FOR TOMMY, AS USUAL, BUT THIS TIME WITH A DASH OF SOMETHING DEADLY. SHE CRUSHES UP SEDATIVES AND SLIPS THEM IN HIS FOOD. I WAS LIKE, "IF HE WOULD JUST SLEEP, "YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT "IF I SAID SOMETHING WRONG "OR IF HE HAD A BAD PHONE CALL, ANYTHING. "I WOULDN'T HAVE TO HEAR HIS MOUTH. "HE WOULD BE ASLEEP. AND MAYBE I WOULD GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT PEACE." THEN SHE ADDS AN EVEN MORE LETHAL INGREDIENT. I ALSO ADDED THE LITTLE TABLETS OF RAT POISON. THAT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S ONE THING TO MAKE YOUR HUSBAND SLEEP SO YOU COULD HAVE SOME PEACE. I THINK I WANTED MORE, BUT I WAS SITTING THERE, I THINK, TELLING MYSELF THAT I JUST WANTED HIM TO SLEEP. BUT DEEP DOWN, I FELT LIKE I WANTED MORE, TOO. WHEN YOU SAY YOU WANTED MORE, YOU WANTED...? HIM DEAD. WHEN TOMMY COMES HOME FROM WORK, SARAH'S READY TO SERVE UP HER DELICIOUS REVENGE. YOU ARE NEVER LEAVING ME! AFTER EIGHT TURBULENT YEARS WITH TOMMY SHACKELFORD, SARAH WANTS OUT OF HER MARRIAGE, AND SHE'LL DO ANYTHING IT TAKES TO BREAK FREE. HER HUSBAND, TOMMY, COMES HOME TO A SPECIAL DINNER WAITING FOR HIM. IT'S A MEAL LETHAL ENOUGH TO SEND HIM TO HIS GRAVE. GOOD DAY? YOU ALL RIGHT? THAT LITTLE JERK STILL PICKING ON YOU? SHE HAD MADE ME A COUPLE OF SANDWICHES - SAUSAGE, EGG, AND CHEESE - AND BROUGHT ME SOME ORANGE JUICE. I AM BEAT. HERE YOU GO. MMM, BREAKFAST FOR DINNER? MM-HMM. ALL RIGHT. I STARTED DRINKING THE ORANGE JUICE, AND IT TASTED REALLY BITTER. THIS ORANGE JUICE TASTES FUNNY. WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST... TASTES WEIRD. YOU GOT SOMETHING ELSE BACK THERE? UH, YEAH, I GOT SOME COLA. WANT THAT? YEAH. GIVE ME SODA. ALL RIGHT. WHEN I GOT TO THE FIRST SANDWICH, I NOTICED SOMETHING GREEN ON IT. THERE'S SOMETHING GREEN IN HERE. OH, IT LOOKS LIKE MOLD! THOSE ARE PEPPER FLAKES. I'VE NEVER SEEN A PEPPER FLAKE THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT. WELL, THEN, EAT THE OTHER ONE. OURS WAS JUST FINE. SHE BROUGHT ME A GLASS OF DRINK, AND IT TASTED THE SAME WAY. THAT TASTES BAD, TOO! GIVE ME THE BOTTLE. ALL RIGHT. IT'S THE SAME ONE I ALWAYS GET, SEE? YEAH, YOU BUYING THIS CHEAP CRAP. IT'S NOT... I TOOK THE BOTTLE AND TURNED IT UPSIDE-DOWN, AND YOU COULD SEE A THICK, DARK GREEN SUBSTANCE RUNNING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE BOTTLE. TAKE IT BACK. SARAH AGREES TO TAKE THE SODA BACK AND TELLS TOMMY SHE'S TAKING MASON TO SEE HIS GRANDMOTHER. SHE CAN ONLY HOPE HE ATE ENOUGH OF THE POISON TO KILL HIM. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT? AND NONE OF THAT DIET STUFF, EITHER. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT APPRECIATE IT. OH, WE TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW? DAMN IT. A FEW HOURS LATER, IT LOOKS LIKE SHE MAY GET HER WISH. TOMMY BECOMES VIOLENTLY ILL. IN DESPERATION, HE CALLS SARAH. SARAH, CAN YOU COME HOME? YEAH, I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD. I DIDN'T KNOW AT THAT TIME THAT IT WAS RAT POISON. I WAS ASSUMING THAT IT WAS JUST BAD FOOD. AS WAVES OF GUILT WASH OVER HER, SARAH RUSHES HOME TO FIND TOMMY DOUBLED OVER ON THE FLOOR. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? OH, MY GOD. OH, GOD. SHE IMMEDIATELY TAKES HIM TO THE HOSPITAL. I COULDN'T DO IT. IT WAS, LIKE, I DON'T - NERVES. MY BRAIN WAS SO WISHY-WASHY, AND HE WAS SCARING ME JUST SEEING HIM LIKE THAT. TELL ME WHAT ALL YOU HAD TO EAT. SAUSAGE, AND... AT THE HOSPITAL, TOMMY'S TREATED FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE A BAD CASE OF FOOD POISONING. DOCTOR, COULD I SPEAK TO YOU FOR JUST A MOMENT? SURE. THANK YOU. SARAH'S NOT READY FOR TOMMY TO COME HOME, SO SHE COMES UP WITH A LIE TO BUY SOME TIME. He was screaming and crying about how he wanted to kill himself. SHE HOPES IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO GET TOMMY SENT TO THE PSYCH WARD. UH, WE MAY NEED TO KEEP HIM OVER THE WEEKEND. WELL, TOMMY. WE'VE DECIDED WE LIKE YOU SO MUCH, WE'RE GONNA LET YOU STAY A FEW EXTRA DAYS WITH US. WHEN THEY TELL TOMMY THEY'RE ADMITTING HIM FOR OBSERVATION, HE'S OUTRAGED. YOU'RE GONNA TRANSFER ME WHERE? THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MY HEAD! I LOOKED AT THE DOCTOR, I WAS LIKE, "ARE YOU KIDDING ME? REALLY?" I SAID, "'CAUSE I'M NOT CRAZY. I'M NOT TRYING TO KILL MYSELF." BUT THE DOCTORS IGNORE TOMMY'S PROTESTS... NURSE! ...AND INSIST ON COMMITTING HIM TO THE PSYCH WARD FOR THE WEEKEND. MEANWHILE, SARAH FINALLY RESOLVES TO LEAVE TOMMY FOR GOOD. SHE CALLS HIM TO BREAK THE NEWS. I- I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT WH-WHEN YOU GET HOME, UH, MASON AND I WILL NOT BE HERE. NO, NOT LIKE THIS. HIS REACTION ISN'T AT ALL WHAT SHE EXPECTED. I'LL GET BETTER. I WILL. HE TOLD ME THAT WE COULD GO TO MARRIAGE COUNSELING AND THAT HE COULDN'T DO IT BY HIMSELF. I NEED YOU. AND I EVEN ASKED HIM, "HOW CAN I BELIEVE YOU? HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU'RE REALLY GONNA DO THIS?" AND HE WAS JUST LIKE, "I WILL. I WILL. I PROMISE." ALL RIGHT. BUT AS SOON AS TOMMY GETS HOME, SARAH REALIZES HE'S TURNED THE TABLES ON HER. LOOK WHO'S HOME! WE GOT HOME, AND HIS DAUGHTER WAS THERE WAITING. AND OF COURSE, HE HAD TO MAKE A BIG SCENE EXPLAINING TO HER, "YOU KNOW, CAN YOU BELIEVE SHE HAD ME ADMITTED? "TRYING TO GET RID OF ME. "SHE'S TRYING TO LEAVE ME. "SHE'S TRYING TO LEAVE US. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?" - SITTING THERE TELLING HIS 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER THIS. HEY, LET ME TAKE THAT. I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK. YEAH, ME TOO. TOMMY'S COMMENTS JUST REINFORCE SARAH'S DESIRE TO GET RID OF HIM ONCE AND FOR ALL. THAT VERY EVENING, SHE SERVES HIM A HEAPING PLATE OF HIS FAVORITE FOOD - CREAMED POTATOES. ONLY THIS RECIPE HAS ENOUGH SEDATIVES TO PUT HIM TO SLEEP FOREVER. HOW WERE YOUR DAYS? FINE. FINE, FINE. IT'S ALWAYS FINE WITH YOU TWO. COME ON. SHE NEVER THINKS THROUGH HER LIFE CHOICES VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE SHE MAKES THEM, AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER SNAP DECISION. SHE JUST DOESN'T CARE ANYMORE WHETHER SHE SEDATES HIM, WHETHER HE SLEEPS, WHETHER SHE KILLS HIM. SHE JUST WANTS THE MERRY-GO-ROUND OF EMOTIONS AND DRAMA TO STOP. TOMMY IMMEDIATELY NOTICES AN UNUSUAL AFTERTASTE. THESE TATERS, THEY TASTE FUNNY. "WHY DO MY CREAMED POTATOES TASTE LIKE WHAT I ATE FRIDAY?" THEY SHOULDN'T. THERE'S NO CONNECTION. I SAID, "ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?" AND THEN, WE JUST PLAYED IT OFF. THEY TASTE LIKE POTATOES. YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY ALL IN MY HEAD. ALL RIGHT, SO BACK TO THIS BOY. KEITH? WHAT KIND OF NAME IS KEITH, ANYWAY? AFTER DINNER, THE SEDATIVES KICK IN. OH, HEY, MAS, WHY DON'T YOU PUT THAT DOWN. GET YOUR STUFF. I LAID ON THE COUCH, AND I GOT REALLY TIRED. AND I COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT. I JUST GOT REALLY DROWSY, REALLY SLEEPY. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. GET IN THE CAR. LET'S GO. HEY, BABY. I'M GONNA GO DROP HER OFF, OKAY? BYE. SARAH'S DEVIOUS PLOT IS IN MOTION. BUT AS SHE DRIVES HER STEPDAUGHTER HOME, SARAH STARTS TO WORRY THAT THE DRUGS AREN'T POTENT ENOUGH TO KILL TOMMY. DID THE THOUGHT START TO FLOOD HER BRAIN? "WELL, A SEDATIVE, IT'S ONLY GOING TO WEAR OFF "AFTER A FEW HOURS. "I MAY HAVE PEACE NOW, BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT "IS TO HAVE PEACE IN MY HOUSEHOLD ALWAYS "SO THAT I CAN JUST BE A PROPER MOTHER TO MY CHILD "AND NOT HAVE TOMMY ALWAYS TELLING ME WHAT A FAILURE I AM. IF HE NEVER WOKE UP, WOULDN'T THAT BE THE BEST SOLUTION?" SO SARAH COMES UP WITH A PLAN TO FINISH THE JOB. AFTER DROPPING TOMMY'S DAUGHTER OFF, SHE RACES BACK TO THE HOUSE. YOU GET THIS IDEA IN YOUR HEAD THAT YOU COULD GET RID OF TOMMY. I FELT LIKE THERE WASN'T NO OTHER WAY. I COULDN'T GET AWAY. AND IT WAS EITHER ME WIND UP TAKING MY LIFE, OR - TAKING HIS. TAKING HIS. STAY RIGHT HERE. I'LL BE BACK, OKAY? THE THOUGHT OF BEING FREE OF TOMMY FOR GOOD SUPER-CHARGES SARAH'S FOCUS. NOTHING CAN STOP HER. I WENT INTO THE BACK DOOR. IT'S THE DOOR WE ALWAYS USE. AND TOMMY'S ASLEEP ON OUR COUCH. AND I COULD SEE HIM FROM THE BACK DOOR AS I WALK IN. WE HAVE A LITTLE JUNK DRAWER THAT'S IN OUR KITCHEN. SO I GO TO THE JUNK DRAWER, AND HE HAS GLOVES. I PUT ON THE GLOVES, AND HE ALSO HAS A VERY SHARP POCKET KNIFE THAT HE USES A LOT FOR FISHING. I GRABBED THE KNIFE. I OPENED THE KNIFE. AND I WALK, AND I STAND RIGHT BY HIS HEAD. BUT AS SHE HOVERS OVER HER SLEEPING HUSBAND, SARAH HAS SECOND THOUGHTS. I START FEELING MYSELF BREAKING DOWN, AND I KEEP TELLING MYSELF, "I GOT TO STAY STRONG 'CAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY." SHE'S TOO CLOSE TO FREEDOM TO BACK DOWN NOW. FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS, SARAH SAUNDERS HAS BEEN TRYING DESPERATELY TO KILL HER HUSBAND. BYE. AFTER TWO FAILED ATTEMPTS TO POISON HIM, SHE DECIDES ONLY BRUTE FORCE CAN FINISH HIM OFF. SO, I GRABBED THE KNIFE. AND I STABBED HIM IN HIS TEMPLE. AND AS SOON AS I FELT IT HIT, I PANICKED. SARAH BOLTS OUT OF THE HOUSE. WHAT HAPPENED? I FORGOT SOMETHING. SHE SPEEDS TO HER NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. HELP! - HELP! - WHAT'S GOING ON? DO YOU MIND IF I USE YOUR PHONE FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE? HERE IT IS. OH, THANK YOU. WHEN SHE CALLS 911, SHE'S ARMED WITH AN ELABORATE LIE. I'D LIKE TO REPORT A POSSIBLE HOMICIDE. HE WAS A TALL, BLACK MAN. HE WAS STANDING OVER MY HUSBAND WITH A KNIFE. YOU COULDN'T HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. SHE'S NOT A COLD-BLOODED KILLER. SHE DIDN'T EVEN SNAP SO MUCH AS SHE COLLAPSED. SHE COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. OKAY. LITTLE DOES SARAH KNOW... ...TOMMY SHACKELFORD IS NOT DEAD. IN FACT, HE WOKE UP SECONDS AFTER SHE DROVE THE KNIFE INTO HIS TEMPLE. I COULD HEAR IT. IT WAS LIKE A LOUD POP, AND IT FELT LIKE SOMEBODY HAD THROWN A BRICK AND HIT ME IN THE HEAD. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH MY HEAD. I COULD FEEL IT. IT WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE, SO I TOUCHED IT. AND THERE WAS A KNIFE THERE. IT WAS THE WEIRDEST FEELING. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT, BUT AT THAT POINT, I REALIZED THAT, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO KILL ME. SARAH? I REMEMBER STANDING UP AND THINKING, "WHAT'S GOING ON?" SARAH! I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE. TOMMY'S PHONE IS MISSING, AND THE HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE A LANDLINE. SARAH! SO, I WALKED OUT THE BACK DOOR, AND I SEE SARAH. SARAH. SARAH! AND I HOLLERED FOR HER. TOMMY STUMBLES OVER TO THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE TO GET HELP. IT'S ONLY 200 YARDS, BUT IT FEELS LIKE MILES. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA MAKE IT THERE. I TAKE OFF ACROSS THE FIELD, AND I TOLD GOD, I SAID, "GOD, WHAT ABOUT MY CHILDREN? MY DAUGHTER HAS A MOTHER, WHO SHE STAYS WITH." I SAID, "BUT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO MY SON?" AND THAT'S ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS MY SON. SARAH IS STILL ON THE 911 CALL DESCRIBING THE IMAGINARY INTRUDER. KIND OF AVERAGE HEIGHT. MY HUSBAND WALKS AROUND THE CORNER... WITH THE KNIFE STILL IN HIS HEAD, AND BLOOD IS STREAMING. AND I FREEZE. DAD! WHAT HAPPENED? IN SPITE OF THE BLADE STICKING OUT OF HIS HEAD... DAD! ...TOMMY TAKES CONTROL. YOU GET HIM IN THE HOUSE! GET HIM IN THAT HOUSE NOW! DON'T LET HIM SEE ME LIKE THIS! HELLO? YEAH, THIS IS THE HUSBAND. THAT'S RIGHT. I'VE GOT A KNIFE IN MY HEAD. YEAH, IT'S STILL THERE. YEAH, I KNOW EXACTLY WHO DID IT. SHE IS RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME. NO. PLEASE LET GO! IT WAS MY WIFE. TOMMY, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. PLEASE HELP! DON'T YOU SAY A WORD TO ME. I'M SORRY. I JUST LOOKED AT HER LIKE, "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS TO ME." I'M SORRY. PLEASE. SARAH IS HYSTERICAL... IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. ...TRAPPED IN HER OWN LIE. WHEN PARAMEDICS ARRIVE AT THE SCENE, THEY'RE AMAZED TO FIND TOMMY STILL ALIVE. THEY CAREFULLY LOAD HIM INTO THE AMBULANCE AND RUSH TO THE HOSPITAL. WE GOT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, AND WE WENT THROUGH THE COUPLE LITTLE DOORS. THEY PUT ME IN THIS ROOM RIGHT INSIDE THE DOOR, AND EVERYBODY WAS TAKING PICTURES. WHAT YOU DOING WITH THEM CAMERAS? AND I'M JUST LAYING THERE. COMING DOWN. HOLD STILL, TOMMY. THEN THEY SNATCHED THE KNIFE OUT. BRING HIM UP. THEY SHOWED ME THE KNIFE, AND I TOLD THEM, "YES, THAT'S MINE." THAT'S MY KNIFE. TOMMY IS SENT FOR EMERGENCY SURGERY. MEANWHILE, OFFICERS QUESTION SARAH ABOUT THE ATTACK. AT THIS POINT, YOU'RE STILL SAYING IT WAS AN INTRUDER. YEAH. I DID LIE, AND I DID SAY THAT THERE WAS A MAN IN OUR HOUSE. SARAH STICKS TO HER STORY THAT AN INTRUDER STABBED TOMMY. BUT DETECTIVES AT THE PITT COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AREN'T BUYING IT. I MAY HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU IN THE MORNING. THEY LET HER GO HOME FOR THE NIGHT BUT ASK HER TO COME BACK THE NEXT DAY FOR FURTHER QUESTIONING. WE DID NOT HAVE PRIOR HISTORY WITH HER EVER DOING ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE, AND SO, OF COURSE WE WANTED TO DO A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. THIS WAS A MALE VICTIM WHO DID NOT SEE WHO DID IT BUT WHO DID KNOW WHO HE SAW IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS. THAT NIGHT, DETECTIVES ALSO QUESTION 6-YEAR-OLD MASON, THE ONLY WITNESS. THIS CHILD SAYS THAT WHEN THEY GOT HOME... SHE SAID TO WAIT IN THE CAR. ...HE STAYED IN THE VEHICLE. WHEN MOM WENT IN THE HOUSE, SHE HAD NOTHING IN HER HAND. A LITTLE WHILE LATER, SHE CAME OUT WITH A BROWN GLOVE ON. OKAY. A BROWN GLOVE? A BROWN GLOVE IN HER HAND, AND SHE RAN TO THE VEHICLE, JUMPED IN, AND THEN MOM TOOK OFF. YOU MIND IF I TALK TO THE PATIENT FOR A SECOND? HOW ABOUT THIS ITEM? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BEFORE? TOMMY CONFIRMS THAT BOTH THE GLOVES AND THE KNIFE CAME FROM THE SAME DRAWER IN THE HOUSE. THANK YOU, SIR. THE NEXT DAY AT THE POLICE STATION, SARAH FINALLY CRACKS. SHE ADMITS TO STABBING HER HUSBAND AND IS IMMEDIATELY ARRESTED. WHEN SHE WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE FACT THAT HER SON TOLD AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORY, SHE PRETTY MUCH KNEW AT THAT POINT THAT IT WAS OVER. THE GAME WAS OVER. IN A WAY, I ACTUALLY HAD SOME KIND OF RELIEF. I ACTUALLY MADE THE COMMENT AFTER I CONFESSED THAT I WAS FINALLY FREE. TOMMY'S NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT HIS WIFE CONFESSED, BUT IT'S STILL A HUGE BLOW. SHE WANTED ME DEAD. SHE TRIED WITH EVERYTHING SHE HAD, AND IT DIDN'T WORK. SARAH TAKES A PLEA, AND IN NOVEMBER 2011, SHE'S SENTENCED TO 12 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE MURDER AND FOR THE THEFT OF HER CLIENT'S RING. TOMMY IS AWARDED FULL CUSTODY OF MASON. BY GOING TO PRISON FOR STABBING TOMMY, SHE DID LOSE THE SON THAT SHE WAS SO DESPERATELY TRYING TO SAVE, THE SON THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS ABOUT TO LOSE FOREVER AND IRONICALLY DID. YOU'RE FREE FROM TOMMY, BUT YOU LOST YOUR SON. WAS IT WORTH IT? NO. I WISH I COULD TAKE IT BACK EVERY DAY. AND IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO LIVE WITH EVERY DAY. IT WAS NOT WORTH IT. NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
