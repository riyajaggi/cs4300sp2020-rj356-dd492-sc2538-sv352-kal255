Did you try calling... - Miss? Tartar sauce? - Tartar sauce. Got it. - Look at this. Got eight missed calls from him last night. Weird, right? And his dad said that, when he woke up this morning, Connor was already gone. That means no one's seen him all day.

I said he was probably working on something special for his story tonight. - Oh, no, he's making his own horror movie, yeah, and it's gonna be really bad, and he's gonna make us watch it. - Listen, if that was it, then he'd be here to show us. Okay, something about this feels really weird. He's the leader of the Midnight Society. He wouldn't just bail on us like this. Gabby, when's the last time you talked to him? - Um, Saturday morning.

Hurry up. - I don't think I can, man. - Come on, dude, you're gonna love it. - No, really, I can't. - Come on, dude. It's gonna be great. - I can't. - You serious? - Listen, man, I'm cool with sneaking out for the Midnight Society, but I can't keep doing this kind of stuff. Every single time you have a crazy idea, it ends up with me getting in trouble. Last time, I was grounded for two whole months, man. - Okay, but I haven't even told you what we're gonna be doing yet. - Well, I'm trying to tell you no. - Why don't you just listen to what I'm trying... - Why do you always have to be so stubborn? - Why are you always so afraid? ♪ ♪ Forget it. I'll do it myself. Better off on my own anyway. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Luke? ♪ ♪ Did he say anything to you about what he was doing? - No, I don't know. ♪ ♪ - Social media... Has he posted anything over the weekend? - I'm looking now. [sighs] Just a few photos. Guys. Do you see that? - Yeah, it's kind of by the boatyard. Bad angle though. He should have gone lower. Maybe down on the highlights a bit. - Jai, the background. - I don't see anything. - Turn up the brightness. What is that? - Maybe it's a shadow. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ - No way. - It's the same shadow. - And it's following him. - When I saw him on Saturday, what if he wasn't running to something? What if he was running away from something? - No, Photoshop or a bad Facetune job. - It's not Facetune, Jai. - Gabby, when you saw Connor, did you see anyone following him? - We don't even know what this is yet. It's just a blurry shadow. - Yeah, but if somebody was, then he could be in trouble. We should be out there looking for him. - Whoa, whoa, slow down. I mean, it's already past midnight. There's nothing we can do right now. - Jai's right. If Connor doesn't show up for school tomorrow, we'll start looking for answers. Agreed? Until then, I declare this meeting of the Midnight Society closed. [soft dramatic music] [school bell rings] ♪ ♪ - Anyone know Connor's combination? - Step aside, children. Daddy's got this.

[dramatic music] - Dude, girls wear bobby pins, right? - I don't even know what that is. - Silence. Mommy's working. - Sorry. [sighs] - How did you do that? - Practice. You gotta break the rules to change the rules. - "Curses." - "Dragon powder, love potion water." - Why would Connor have all these? - Maybe this is what Connor was doing before he went missing... He was reading about curses. - How do we know he hasn't always had these? We don't know when he got them. This could be a dead end. - No, it's not. This is a receipt from last Friday. - This is the place. - Sardo's Magic Mansion! Seriously, this is the best place ever. You guys like magic too? Hanna hates it... - Listen. The only reason you're here is because Mom won't let you ride the bus alone. We have a quick question for the owner, so you're gonna be quiet, stay outside, and wait for us. If you can do all that, me and my friends will watch one of your magic tricks. - Okay. [soft plucky music] ♪ ♪ [knocks] - Magic word. - Uh, we don't... we just... We want to talk to the owner. - Sorry, bye, now. [chuckles] ♪ ♪ [knocks] - Magic word. - Okay, listen, our friend is missing. We think that he might have seen you. - Sorry, that's not the magic word. Have a very nice day! - Is this guy serious? - I thought you said you'd been here before, Hanna. - I've never gone in. I've just dropped Seth off. [sighs] What's the magic word, Seth? Tell us and I'll buy you something. Please. [knocks] - What? ♪ ♪ Oh. Magic word. - Abra... ♪ ♪ - Oh. - [whispers] Cadabra. - [sighs] - Abracadabra? - It was abracadabra. - It's a magic shop, so... - Yeah, wow. - Mr. Sardo? - Mr. Sardo was my grandfather. My name is Sardo! No mister, accent on the "do". Do not touch that! That's not a plaything, trust me. - Hey, uh... have you seen our friend? - Yes. Been looking everywhere for that little thief. - Thief? - Your friend broke into my shop on Sunday night and stole something very valuable from me. - No, he didn't. He bought these books. We literally have the receipt. - Yeah, those. But when I refused to sell him a special spell book I keep locked away, he took up late night burglary. Do not touch those! - Jai. ♪ ♪ - Okay, come, come, playtime's over. Either buy now or bye, now. - Okay, why was he reading up on curses? - No clue, but if I had friends like you, I'd probably think I was cursed too because you all suck. As kids, you all suck. - You know what... We're just trying to find our friend. Quit being such a jerk. - Oh, so polite kids are these days. - You know what? Okay, boomer, you... - Boy, put down the stone! - Hey, everybody, look! - Hey, everyone, leave. - How do you even know it was Connor who stole the book? - Because I do. - How? - [sighs] All right. All right, I'll show you. ♪ ♪ Don't tell anyone about this. [door rattles] All right, come in. Don't touch anything, and I mean anything! So just anything. Come on. Okay. See? [chuckles] Right there. [chuckles] - Bet he used a bobby pin. - Nope, he used one of these. Skeleton key, sold it to him the other day. The boy is truly a barbarian. - [yelps] [objects clatter] - Those crystal balls are very rare and practically priceless. - It says "7.99." - That's a different one, so... - Whoa, whoa, guys, Sardo's right. Connor's taking the book. [eerie music] - What book is it? - That is the Book of Shadows. It goes back centuries, holding spells from ancient times. It's actually priceless. [scoffs] There you have it. Your criminal confidant fleeing the scene of the crime. - Why did he go out the back door? - What do you mean? - I mean, he came through the front. Why didn't he just go out that way? - Hold up, rewind it. Look at the front door. ♪ ♪ You see that? ♪ ♪ How did it do that? ♪ ♪ - Wait, that's a flash frame. Go back. ♪ ♪ - It's that thing... The same thing from his photos. ♪ ♪ - The Shadowman. ♪ ♪ - Why does this matter? - Okay, you have a story to tell. We have a process. Respect that. - [sighs] May I begin now? - Yes. - Okay. Once upon a time... - Wait, you can't start that way. - Of course I can. - We have rules. - Of course you do. - It's a Midnight Society thing. - Does that mean I'm part of the Midnight Society now? - No. - Every story must begin with these words. Think you can handle that? - I'll try my best. Okay. Before I begin, if I may, this story is about three kinds of people... The people who believe in curses, the people who don't believe in curses, and the people who should. [eerie music] Okay. "Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society," I call this story "The Tale of the Haunted Woods." [soft dramatic music] It is said that, upon nightfall, no child is allowed to enter the Haunted Woods because once the sun sets and darkness falls, an evil monster roams the land. [children chattering]  They call it the Shadowman. ♪ ♪ - Hey, find your own spot. ♪ ♪ - Over the years, every child who dared to venture into the woods after dark mysteriously disappeared. ♪ ♪ - Hold up. Becky Peters went into those woods, and her whole family disappeared. - That's because they moved to Oregon. - Everyone knows about those woods. There's no bogeyman. They're just off-limits because it's dangerous to go near the cliffs at night. - May I go back to the story?

No monsters under the bed. - I know he's not under there. - As long as you know that, there's no reason to be afraid. Now, let's get you back into bed. - He wasn't under the bed because he's somewhere else. - Ah, he's in the closet, right? - No. - Then where is he? Zoey, where is he? - Behind you. ♪ ♪ - There's no one here, sweetie. Now go to bed. Get some sleep. - Bye, Mom. [ethereal growling] - Scared, Seth? - [sighs] No. Maybe a little just then, but... - So if you go into the Haunted Woods after dark, you're cursed? - Precisely. ♪ ♪ - Okay, so you're cursed, but then what comes after you? Just a shadow? - Not just a shadow... The Shadowman. [merry-go-round creaking] [eerie music] ♪ ♪ According to the legend, the Shadowman can only come for you at night after the sun has set. [ethereal growling] - [gasps] - He watches you. He follows you. [merry-go-round thunking] And he'll never stop until he gets you. ♪ ♪ - [gasps] - I'm a little worried about Zoey. Her teachers say she's falling asleep in class, waking up from bad nightmares. It's hard to even get her to go to bed at all these days. [thunder rumbles] - Please leave the lights on. - Oh, sweetie, that's why you have a nightlight. - I want them all on. Please, Mom, just for tonight. Please, please, please, please. - Okay, but just for tonight. - Good night. - Good night. - With every passing night, the Shadowman grows stronger, biding his time till he's strong enough to get you and drag you into the darkness. [thunder cracks] ♪ ♪ Then when he finally gets you, you belong to the dark forever. - [screams] - So how do you break the curse? - No one knows because no one has ever broken the curse before. - Why does he roam the woods at night? What's special about them? - Because they're guarding the place where his spirit lives. - Which is? - The old lighthouse, of course. [door opens] Taking off already? Boy, oh, boy, I must have scared you all silly. [chuckles] But seriously, where you going? - The lighthouse. - What? That's lunacy! - And I'm coming too. - No, Seth, you're going home. - But I want to help. - Okay, we're just gonna go quickly check it out. I'll meet you at the house. - Did you imbeciles hear a word I said? You're gonna get yourselves cursed. - It's just an urban legend, Sardo. - Oh. - Some stupid story that parents told their kids in order to scare them from going out there at night. - Ah. - I've been in those woods 100 times. Nothing's ever happened. - Same. The only thing that's ever cursed me is poison oak. - Uh-huh, and have any of you been in those woods after dark? - There's still three hours of daylight left, so even if the urban legend is real, the curse won't affect us. Besides, I have to find out what happened to Connor. He needed me, and I wasn't there for him. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ So I don't care if what you say is true. If Connor really was taken by this Shadowman... ♪ ♪ Then I'm gonna find him. - No, no, don't do it. Those woods are a beast. I would not underestimate them! Hey... no. Or do whatever you like!

What have we been looking for this whole time? - Anyone got any bars? I got none. - Shocker, no cell towers out here. Did you honestly just do that? - What?

[branch snaps] [crow caws] - [grunts] I hate nature. - Guys, over here! - What is it? - Do you see something? - What'd you find? - Nothing really, sorry. But check it out. Too bad these woods are off-limits. This spot would be perfect for the Midnight Society, right? - Yeah, yeah, it would. [child laughing] - Shh, did you guys hear that? - Yeah, sure, let's go toward the ghost girl. That's a good idea. [man shouts] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - Got you! - [screams] - Seth, what are you doing? - I told you I wanted to come with you. - How did you even tail us? - Sorry, a magician never reveals his secrets. - I'm going to kill you.
