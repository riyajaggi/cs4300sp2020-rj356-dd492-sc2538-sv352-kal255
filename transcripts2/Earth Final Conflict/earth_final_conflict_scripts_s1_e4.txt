 Earth: Final Conflict (1997â€“2002): Season 1, Episode 4 - Avatar - full transcript 
 To their astonishment Boone and Marquette are asked to find James Pike, an escaped serial killer. Normally this is ordinary police business and Lili wonders why it has something to do with Companion security. Pike is no ordinary human being. He drew a mysterious painting with markings that look like the Taelon language with his own blood on the wall of his cell and then died. His physician, Dr. Kaplan, confirmed his death and started an autopsy during his state of rigor mortis. Suddenly Pyke awoke and escaped. When Kaplan does some tests on his blood, he notices a strange anomaly. Boone recognizes it immediately and he pays Da'an a visit to get answers.

 You shouldn't do that, you know? Pike! Pike! Wipe it off! Pike. Wipe it off. Okay, buddy, rise and shine. Pike! Pike. Wake up. Pike? I told not to do it. I told him!

 I didn't really think he could die. Or was it suicide? I don't know. My God! What do you think it is? The last will and testament for psychotic pathology. No ones going to mourn his death, believe me. James Pike, male, age 38, height six foot one, weight 174. Incision on right forearm 3 inches in length. Incision on left calf 2 inches in length.

 Both incisions appear to be self inflicted... Three years ago they came forever altering the future of humanity. Subtitled by Axarion How long has he been alarmed? Sandoval says since at least 08:00 this morning. Do you remember the jokes that were flying around when he was first caught? Serial killers were all threatening to sue on the ground that his law degree was ruining their reputation. Yeah, I remember. Close file. What do you think we're doing here, Boone? If Pike escaped, that is a police job, not Companion Security. Sandoval says Da'an wants to serve the public welfare. Well, the public hasn't even been informed that he's escaped. I'm not sure the police even know either. Why would Sandoval wanna keep his escape a secret? I don't know. Well, the longer it's hidden the more likely he'll kill again. And again. Open file. Pike interview. I know that I'll never be allowed to leave this cell. I have enjoined the experimental drug therapy with the hope of being released. I want this penitentiary to be a place of... genuine penitence... change. You must know how sceptically your words are going to received, James. I know. But I believe... if the devil can't be redeemed, then no one is sure in their own salvation. Why aren't police here, warden? There was no public warning, no manhunt whatsoever. You tell me. I follow procedure. The governor told me to do nothing until you arrived. This is Dr. Caplan. Dr. Caplan - William Boone, Lili Marquette. Can you tell us what happened here, please? There was no pulse, no heartbeat... He just stepped off the table as if nothing had happened to him. Can this be an effect of the experimental drugs? No, no. The toxicological scan showed nothing unusual in his system. You know, Doctor, there are some people like yogic masters, who can slow the heart, mirror death. Can they mirror rigor mortis? Why do you think he left you alive, Doctor? I don't know. He had the time, opportunity... I must not fit the profile what's driving him. Well, how would you describe that profile? The newspapers labelled him as a deranged mercy killer. There's nothing of mercy in James Pike. That is misunderstanding of his pathology. He's a judge. He seeks out fear, weakness, inadequacy... And then convicts. You didn't show him any fear, Doctor? What do you think? Look, for whatever reason, he passed me by. I really don't care why. I'm alive. Can you show us his cell? Thank you, Doctor. I hope you're ready for this, Captain. It's not gonna be pretty. Nothing I haven't seen before. He did it the night he died. It's in his own blood? We need to have it analysed. Can Caplan do it? Yeah. Although I doubt he wanna come back down here again. Don't leave the cell when I'm gone. What do you think? This symbol... and this... It looks to me like a language. I know it sounds crazy, but the closest thing they resemble the Taelons own script. Only simpler. But nobody in the world understands their language. Yeah. That's what's so amazing. We can barely pronounce it, little interpret it. It's... it's impossible! Yeah... And dead men don't rise. Shakarravah is come. It's opened, buddy! I appreciate your staying, Doctor. It's important. It's all right. I feel safer here anyway. This is the one place I know Pike isn't coming back to. He's not coming after you. Why would he? You don't have a clue what is he going to do next. James Pike is probable the most intelligent person I've ever known. He was a brilliant criminal lawyer. Persuasive, extreme in his tactics. Yeah, like cutting the head off his clients. Well, precisely my point. Anyway, I'm perfectly happy to stay here, Commander. What did you see? Some kind of minor anomaly. Anomaly? I don't know... Maybe a virus. Boone! What are you doing here? Don't you ever go home? Why? You can't go in. Da'an's resting. Boone? Something urgent, Commander Boone? Yeah... James Pike has a CVI. Yes. I believe he represents the first human to receive our gift. He has benefited from the implant for almost 2 years. Why would you give a CVI to a pathological killer? Human prisons do not rehabilitate. They merely incarcerate. We believe that by eradicating the violence psychosis of such a criminal we offer... humanity... a great benefit. You seem... ill at ease with our decision. I'm... just uncertain why I wasn't informed. Agent Sandoval has convinced me to proceed with the utmost discretion. It would be impossible to explain the Companion's... attempt... to help this man. The public cannot know. In Pike's implant... what was the motivational imperative given him? To love humankind. And he has. For the past two years Mr. Pike has behaved as a model inmate. Then how could he revert? It should be impossible. Then you must discern how the impossible has become possible. You pursue a fellow implant. You know why your privileges have been suspended, James? You've been exhibiting antisocial tenancies again. Are you experiencing any mood swings, James? Now watch this. Who do you think you're talking to, Jonathan? Some Oomratmah? Some what? Guard! Guard! He hung on the prod for 5 seconds. No one should last more than one. Even with an implant. He seems to have tapped into the CVI in ways I would never expect. Pain tolerance, switching his vital signs on and off. I mean this is all really very exciting! In a professional sense. Who do you think you're talking to, Jonathan? Some Oomratmah? Do you recognise the word? I did a linguistic survey of all known languages, ancient and modern. It doesn't appear to be human in origin. Could Pike have used his CVI to forge an understanding of the Taelon's language? I don't see how. I mean his CVI is the same as Sandoval's: enhances mind and memory, redirects motivation. Why in God's name did you give a tool like that to such a dangerous man? He was an experiment. If a pathological killer could be redirected, anyone could. Couldn't you find a pathological neat freak, Doctor? Pike was a volunteer. Oh, I bet. There is a possibility that the aberrations were seen with Pike... are side effects. Side effects of what? Dying. The cerebral viral cells in his blood sample are burnt out. His CVI seems to have a time limit. A sort of built in obsolescence of about two years, and then... the host dies with it. Just his CVI? Or all of them? I don't know. This is a revelation to me as well. Boone, Pike just struck! I have to go there, Doctor. The same images are on his cell wall. A pair of twins: one all eye, one all mouth. And now he's had one twin kill the other. Yeah, but he's never done anything like this before. It doesn't fit his MO. This was a message. This is way of telling us what's to come next. Next?! How many more people you gonna let him kill before he finishes his... performance. Look, nothing he has done is random. The images on his wall, his resurrection, this ritualized killing - he is acting on something I don't yet understand. But the only way we gonna stop him is to find out what it is. And then to move as quickly as his CVI. No. You're talking like he is rational. I saw nothing rational in that hotel room. May not be rational, but it is predictable. Pike's implant has access to the Taelon language and their way of thinking. Every answer we'll ever need about the Companions may already be inside of his mind. We have to tell Doors about this. At the very least he can help us find him. Pike's not gonna let himself be studied. He is dying. CVI is burning out. It's killing him. Belman thinks there's built in obsolescence within implant. Her version to this formal pathology is just a... nasty side effect. And your implant? It makes sense. It's like driving a racing car really fast. your mind works at such incredible speed that eventually it just... crashes. Boone... Don't think about it. I don't. Go, Sandoval. We have a problem. Someone has breached the security protocols in the building's control centre. Taelon systems? Yes. How? I wouldn't be on the view screen if I knew either who or how, Boone. It's Pike. Stay close to Da'an. We're in a shuttle. We're less than 30 seconds from your location. Sandoval. Sandoval. Tracing the signal. Yeah. May I help you, Mr. Pike? Oomratmah! Shinouhee Uhuurah. Shakarravah. Dyh'jwanee. Eemrah. Naweegy. Oomrah. Shakarravah. U'wooah. Where is he? This is crazy, but the signal is not coming from Earth. He is using a satellite. Applying satellite relay centres. Overlay the signal patterns. If he can breach Companions headquarters, he can take the shuttle. Stay with it. I'm glad you're here. I wanted to talk to you. You're not thinking, Boone! I know you're dying. Of course I'm dying! Every avatar dies to be reincarnated! The wall... Who are you on the wall? Now you're using your gift. Listen closely. Oomratmah and his lies will be silenced by death. I must caution you not to look at or to talk to the prisoners. You can expect it to be a little bit zoo when you enter. A zoo of humans. It's not humanity's best face. We do what we can with what we're given. I know well the effect of... the cage upon both the captive and the captor. You have a grave responsibility of which you equate yourself well, I trust. Thank you. Can you tell me why your fellows have put you here? I killed... three... maybe ah... maybe four times. And... why might you have done that? Help me. Da'an. I could love you... to death. Does this debasement... represent the cost of your human freedom, Boone? One of them. I cannot claim to fathom this. Please, come this way. Can you read it? I can recite it by heart if you wish. Pike's CVI is essentially the same as yours and Commander Boone's. So we have the same built in time limit? I can't really say until I run some tests. Has Boone asked to be tested? Look, if you're concerned about your time limit, come and see me. After you've checked with Da'an, of course. What do you mean by that? Only that I have to follow the protocol. I believe you misunderstand my concern, Doctor. The only reason I've broached this with you is my desire to maximize the time I have... to aid Da'an. I understand. Come and see me anytime. There is no need for hysterics. It's been a long time since you gave me my gift. I'd like another. I can't... I can't take out your CVI. I... I can't prolong your life. That's not the gift I covet. Please... drive on. The sacred texts tell of a sign. A dire omen... appearing in the heavens. Twins, two avatars of grace. Oomratmah and Shakarravah quarrel over the meaning of the omen. Oomratmah vanquishes Shakarravah and casts him into the void. Pike, he sees himself as Shakarravah? I do believe you are correct. But the void does not consume Shakarravah. Through anguish and denials, he emerges... with the fury of the truth... that burns away all the illusions of Oomratmah. The voice of all lies. Oomratmah, the liar. Pike called you that. So it would appear. In your mythology Shakarravah succeeded. Pike could too. He intends to kill you and he won't stop until he does. I am in agreement. Da'an. Who's this? The detail was incredible. Taelon constellation, figures from the mythology... Things that only a Companion should know about. Do you think it's because his CVI is imploding and burning out? He knows the things and Da'an's willing to risk his life to find out how he knows. Ok. Caplan said that Pike sought out fear and weakness. Those are not Companion qualities. So why he would be hunting Da'an? Would his CVI affect his pathology that much? What was the motivational imperative given to him? To love mankind. Oh, my God! He sees the Companions as a threat to that imperative. Maybe... Trying to guess his mind is like staring in a painting by Bosch. He draws you into his world and then you can't figure out how much of it is real and how much of it is just demonic. So what are we gonna do? Well, you're gonna die. No! Please. Don't. He's using a Taelon holograph. Find it, prep the shuttle. You're an incredible craftsman. Never seen this density of transmission before. How much time you need to trace me? You tell me. I'm sure you know. Tell me something else. The men you butchered in the motel... Is that your gift of love? I have a higher calling. Oh yeah, I remember. "I want this penitentiary to be a place of genuine penance and change." Too bad it didn't work out that way, eh, James? I've suffered through denial and agony to find my role! There's no choice! I see and I must judge. No. You just love the role. Oh, are you really so naive?! Or... are you merely trying to keep me talking? We're two sides of the same coin. You kill for your master and are rewarded. I kill and am condemned. Word games. I think you know yourself better than that, James. Yes. I do know myself. Do you? When they... murdered your wife how did you feel? Shut up. Did the leash they put in your brain allow you the least regret? I told you - shut up! Or were you tearless when you saw her charred, violated body, and imagined the suffering she had endured? Shut up! I don't understand. Such emotion... Have snapped the liar's chains? Your implant broken? Are you... as human as I? Oomratmah Shinouhee Uhuurah! Traced the source, the shuttle is prep. Let's go! Da'an has to get this before his public appearance. Make sure he takes those precautions. What about Pike? He let us trace him. He doesn't make mistakes. You go, take Sandoval's men. Boone. Don't you make mistake. Oh, my God! Doctor Belman. It's okay. You're gonna be all right. What happened? I... I had to do it... He took... He took me into the lab. What are you talking about? I altered his CVI. My God! He can fire Sandoval's skrill! Oh, chiz. Sandoval. Come on, come on, come on. Need a medical team at the ComTech Laboratory, immediately. You're gonna be all right. An ambulance is on the way. Da'an... Da'an... I was to guard him. I know. I'll go as soon as the ambulance arrives. Boone, Boone... When he took my skrill... he said... he said... "The servant's arrow would slay the master." Go! Go now. Okay, okay! I have received your message, Commander. Curious... You truly believe that he might strike me in such a public setting? At a gathering of peace? He has agent Sandoval's skrill. I see. And agent Sandoval? Alive. Then, perhaps we must forgo this public display of diplomacy. Your assessment? I'm almost at the campus. Can you take the precautions I suggested? But can the prey be too cautious when the hunter is so armed? Proceed, please. Boone, I'm at the shuttle. Where are you? Right here. - How's Belman? - Shocked she's alive. - Did he put a mark on her? - Yeah, the bow and arrow. The skrill. Truth... reveals itself in enigma. Let us approach it with awe as diviners of the one mystery. Oomratmah! Down! Everybody down! It is done. Stay back! We got him! No! Da'an. Protect Da'an! The same illusion you used in his office. Tell me, before he comes... Have you broken Oomratmah's hold? Are you as human as I? Then I have not failed. You will be their Shakarravah. You will reveal them. Reveal them? Reveal them for what? You know... Inside you. Their world is inside the mind they gave you. Your implant. How do I get inside it? How do I understand? By dying? By letting my CVI burn out? When you see, when you know, you will judge them. Help me to understand. Know what?! Afraid... They are afraid... Afraid of what?! Pike, what are Taelons afraid of?! The sleeper will come... Pike. Pike! There is much I would have asked this enigma. What confession does he impart to you? Nothing. Just incoherent rambling about Oomrathamah. The liar. And what might your dissection have revealed about the cerebral cortex of the prisoner Pike? Little. The workings of the human mind often  seem as elusive as our own thoughts. You have found nothing. Nothing conclusive. But there remains suggestions that his implant may have allowed his mind to evolve into a neutral state, suggestive of our own collective sentience. And the other implants? I cannot say. Perhaps only psychosis can spark such evolution. Genius and madness walking as one. But, perhaps not. Uhuurah. You will be the Shakarravah. You will reveal them. When you see, when you know, you will judge them. Afraid... They are afraid. The sleeper will come! The sleeper will come...
