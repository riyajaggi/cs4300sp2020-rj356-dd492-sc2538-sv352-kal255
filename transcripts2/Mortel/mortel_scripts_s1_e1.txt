 Run! [chuckles] - [Rodrigue] Fucking cocksucker! - Go that way! [indistinct shouting] [boy 1] Hurry up! Hurry, hurry. [Rodrigue] Catch him! Where is that son of a bitch? [cell phone ringing] [Bastien] Where are they? [Sofiane] You don't wanna guess who the chick is? Uh... Vanessa Tarpito? [Hubert] Nobody gives a shit! [panting] Bastien and his boys are gonna kill us because of you! Relax, bro, it's all good. It's all good? You pick a fight and now you throw ink in their faces? - I confess. - Kylian, you said you'd tell him. Yeah, "Kylian, you said you'd tell him..." Stop it, now! - We're serious. - Move. Hey, Sofiane! You act like you're fine, but we know it's hardcore at home. Sofiane! Sofiane! [Hubert] We don't wanna hang out with you anymore. [Kylian] Yes, basically... - Oh, yeah? - [Hubert] Yeah. [Kylian] You're seriously fucked up. - Sofiane, stop! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - What are you doing? - It's nothing. Keep on walking. Nothing? Come with me to the counselor's office and you'll tell her it's nothing. And if I don't, what are you gonna do? - What am I gonna do? [hitting] - [Sofiane] Whoa, whoa. Stop! Stop! - What am I gonna do? - Hey, whoa, whoa... - [writes] - [door opens] [Sofiane] Get off me. Sit down! Sit down! - Tell her what happened! - Whoa. - I didn't do anything. I was... - I'll tell her what happened. He was disrespectful. Period. That's why I had to get rough. Kaina, how many times do I have to tell you, we don't hit students! You're a hall monitor, not a cop! Thank you. Kaina, we'll talk later. Please, Kaina! [inhales through teeth] [grunts] The door, Kaina. - Close it, thank you. - [Sofiane] She's crazy! [door closes] This can't go on, Sofiane. Your brother ran away, and that's terrible. It's no excuse to misbehave. - And stop with the wrestlers! - He didn't run away. Okay? - I know he didn't run away. - Okay. But tell me how I can continue supporting you. I saved you from getting expelled. I insisted that you stay here, to keep an eye on you, but... I can't keep up. Maybe I was wrong to trust you. You think I trust you? Not you, not anybody. Okay? Mmm. Okay. [Audrey sighs] You've got to talk to me, Sofiane. I can really help you. [scoffs] Like you helped Laurine? [Sofiane] Hmm? You helped her and now she's doing much better in her hospital bed. Is it gonna be the same for me or was she a special case? You've found my weak spot. You push. It hurts. [smacks lips] Where do you think that'll get you? Not here, anyway. [opens door] Do you have a problem? No. I'm here to have lunch with the counselor. What's your name again? Victor. Tell me something, Victor. For a while now, I've felt like I'm being followed. Every time I turn around, there you are. It's starting to piss me off, okay? And you don't wanna see me when I'm pissed off. I saw you putting up notices to find your brother. - I can help you... - Wait, wait. If I needed any help, do you think I'd ask a hobo like you? The weird kid who couldn't even manage to kill himself? If you ever talk to me about my brother, I'll take care of your suicide myself. And it won't just be an attempt. [theme music playing] [school bell rings] [Sofiane] Mélanie. Hey, Mélanie! You enjoy getting beaten up. - Cut it out. - Cut what out? I know you dig my scars. People say you're an asshole, but it's way worse than that. [exhales] Right. Nobody even hangs out with you. I keep to myself by choice. All you've got is two pathetic friends and a school that avoids you because you're a psychopath. Come on. Let's do this. How much time do you have? Not much. I have important things to do. Luckily, with you, it never lasts very long. They got bigger, right? Actually, I gotta go. [chuckles] Wait. Wanna hang tomorrow night? Huh? We can't do it. My mom will be home. No, I didn't mean... We can go out. Out? - What's up with you? - Nothing... - What's up with you? - What's up with you? - Seven o'clock? - Yes. [Luisa] My name is Luisa Manjimbe, I'm 16, and I'm a junior at Les Roches Noires high school. I've been drawing since forever and I'd like to attend your school because I want to transform my passion into my profession. Tell me three things that set you apart from the other candidates that apply to our school every year. I'm a young black girl who comes from the suburbs. I want to tell my own story through my art. Okay. Tell me about your painting. It's a self-portrait that questions other people's ways of seeing skin color. So, to get into the school, you're playing the West Indian woman who escaped from the projects, with a bit of afro-feminism? Is that right? Christ, Luisa. You've got work to do before you're ready for the interview. Then again, they'll never be as mean as you, sir. You've got to work. You have to make sacrifices. Otherwise, you'll stay here with me next year. Mmm-mmm. No way am I rotting here with you. Okay. Okay.

You're pretty happy without him, right? - In your dancer's outfit... - What? Captain of your tired-ass team. Preening on his scooter. Hey. Watch your mouth. Rodrigue, I didn't see you. Stop hiding behind your friends. Back off or I'll destroy you, even if it won't give me pleasure. Not surprising. We know it’s Rodrigue who gives you pleasure. [scoffs] Huh?

Who the hell are you? What do you want? I am Obé. Why are you following me? I'm here for your brother. Reda? Where is he? [Reda] Help! Help! Somebody? Help me! Reda! Where is he? Where is he? What did you do to him? If you obey me, you can save him. Bring someone tomorrow night... to an isolated spot. What are you talking about? Who? Who should I bring? Someone whose death will surprise no one. [Obé] Tomorrow night, Sofiane. Wait. Wait! [Obé] For Reda. [Bobinet] All right, let's calm down. - [indistinct chatter] - Calm down! Take out your books. Quickly. You don't have your things, Kada? No? Mr. Wanderwelt, please read to us the last chapter of this book. We are listening. [clears throat] "This fact, so minor in and of itself, will, for Rastignac, be the gateway to horrible sadness. It was growing dusk. The damp twilight fretted his nerves. He gazed down into the grave and let slip his last tear of youth. That tear, drawn by the sacred emotion of a pure heart. When such tears fall on Earth, their radiance reaches heaven. Rastignac was left alone. He went a few steps further, to the highest point of the cemetery, and looked out over Paris crookedly laying along both sides of the Seine. His eyes lingered almost eagerly between the Vendôme Column and the Dôme des Invalides, where lived the high society he wanted to join. On this hive of activity, he gave a look which seemed to suck his honey in advance... [sniffles] and he said these grandiose words: 'Henceforth, there is war between us.'" [boy] Hey, suicide kid, have some self-respect. - [students chuckle] - [Bobinet] Hey. So, while Victor dries his tears, who wants to tell me what this text is about? [Sofiane] Hey. Where were you, man? I looked for you everywhere. Hang on. Please! I'm sorry, okay? What I said yesterday... I didn't mean it. Ever since my brother... I'm not myself anymore. I'm getting expelled, I'm messing around. [chuckles] Look at me. I spit on people like you who want to help me. And I don't know why. Anyway... Sorry. Sofiane! It's nice of you, but you didn't have to walk me home. Don't try to avoid this conversation. Avoid what? Huh? Bastien, I already told you, I'm not the kind of girl who'll watch you train. I'm not going to kiss you in front of your friends. I'm not saying you weren't clear from the beginning. I just thought, with time, it might get more serious. Why does it have to be serious, Bastien? If there are feelings, then it's obviously serious, no? I'm changing schools next year and you know it. We weren't supposed to get attached. That wasn't my plan. Why does attachment have to be something negative? You're not the only one that has plans, or ambition. I've always been there for you with your drawings. I’ve always supported you with your new school and everything. Don’t act like I’m holding you back when I support you. It's true. I don't know what I'm saying. So I'm sorry, because you do everything right. No. - I don't do everything right. - Yes, you do. If I did, you'd introduce me to your grandmother. I could kiss you in public and... maybe we'd sleep together. At least introduce me to your grandmother. I'm dying to meet her. Come on, please! Everybody knows she does voodoo. What? Seriously, Luisa? What's the problem? What are you ashamed of? I'm not ashamed of anything. I'm protecting you. Every time I talk about your grandmother, you shut down. Why can't you understand? I don't want you to come to my house. That’s enough. [Hervé sighs] - [Martina] If it's not working this time... - [Hervé] I know, my love. - [Martina] You swear? - [Hervé] Don't worry, it'll be fine. [Hervé] I don't feel good. I'm feeling dizzy. - If it doesn't work, we'll do it my way. - Yes, I swear. [Hervé] Please be cool now, okay? I need you. Really. [Grandma] Psst. Where were you? You knew he was coming tonight and you went out with your friends? I didn't know. And why is he here again? It's the fifth time you're curing his cancer. Now he's making his wife believe he's possessed. [in Creole] What do you want me to do? - [in French] Come help me. - [whispers] I have stuff to do. Come help! We'll do the usual act. It will take two seconds. Infidelity spirit, my ass! [Hervé] Grandma, my mouth is kinda dry. [Grandma] Mmm? [Luisa] Hello, Hervé. - [Martina] Hello. - [Luisa] Hello. [Hervé chuckles] Grandma, she gets more beautiful every day. Better lock her up before someone steals her. - [Grandma chuckles] Right... - [chuckles] - [new age music playing] - Oh, God, I'm hot. I'm having cold sweats, Grandma. It's nothing. [Hervé] Luisa? - Can I ask you to hold my hand? - [Grandma] Mmm-mmm. - We're going to begin. - [Hervé] Come near me. [sighs] Thanks. - It has a strong smell. - It's gonna be all right. [Hervé shudders] [Grandma] Come on. Relax. [groaning] - [in Creole] Spirit, leave this man alone. - [Hervé coughs] - Spirit, leave this man alone. - [groaning] Nobody wants you here. Spirit, leave this man alone. [in French] I asked for a small ritual. [in Creole] Spirit, leave this man alone. Nobody wants you here. [in French] Grandma, I'm scared! [in Creole] Spirit, leave this man alone. - Leave him alone, I tell you. - [laughs hysterically] Spirit, leave this man alone. - Spirit, leave this man alone. - [groaning and shuddering] - Spirit, leave this man alone. - [laughs and groans] [in French] Grandma! [Grandma in Creole] Nobody wants you here. Spirit, leave this man alone. [in French] Grandma? - [Grandma] It's nothing. - [Luisa] You're sure? Mmm. It's gonna be all right. [gasps] [Grandma whispers in Creole] Spirit, leave this man alone. [exhales slowly] [in French in deep voice] So it's you... crazy old woman. Grandma, what's going on? - Is he pretending? - [growls] - [Grandma] Spirit, leave this man alone. - What is this? [growls] [chuckles] Crazy old woman, do you think you intimidate me? Leave him alone... - Stop. - [Martina screams] Shut up, bitch! [screams] [Grandma in Creole] Spirit, leave this man alone. [groans] - [n French] Grandma! - [growling and groaning] [in Creole] Leave him alone, I tell you. - Spirit, leave this man alone. - [screams and growls] [in French] Grandma, what is it? Now you know, old hag. - What are you waiting for, Grandma? - [Martina screams] [Grandma in Creole] Spirit, leave this man alone! [Luisa in French] Get out of here! [Grandma in Creole] Leave this man alone! - [in French] Help me! - [Luisa] Grandma, do something! [in Creole] Okay. Hold him. - [screams] - [groans] [Luisa in French] Grandma, go! [groaning] [Luisa] Grandma, hurry up! - [Hervé] Let me go! - [Luisa] Hurry up! [screams] [screams] [screams] - [Grandma in Creole] Leave this man alone! - [groaning] Leave him alone! - Leave this man alone. - [growls] - Leave this man alone. - [yells] - Leave this man alone. - [roars] [Grandma in French] Luisa, I'm not feeling good. - [breathing heavily] I'm not good. - [Luisa] Grandma! What am I supposed to do? It's not working, Grandma. It's not working! [groaning] [screams] [gasps] [breathes heavily] [Hervé murmurs] Hervé, come on. I saved your life, didn’t I? - It's true. You're a saint, Grandma. - Hmm. How many times are you going to save me? - As many times as needed. - [chuckles] Thank you very much. The doctors said the cancer was incurable. - Thank you! - We'll find you an apartment, okay? We'll find you a palace for you and your princess. Yes, okay, thank you. Don't worry, Hervé has everything. Old apartments, new apartments. He has houses... - She knows. We'll leave you now. - Have a safe journey. Do I have to take anything before sleeping? - No, nothing. - Nothing? You're going to sleep like a baby. [chuckles] - Thank you again. - Goodbye. [Grandma] "New disturbance... Possession of non-initiate by spirit." I thought only initiates could be possessed. You know, in trying to cure him, I did too many rituals on him. He's become too sensitive to the energies. I shouldn't have gone so far. - So you did this for the money. - Well... Should I be giving handouts instead? You think it's my miserable pension that's keeping you fed? And buying your fancy clothes? You're too good for school, too good for the projects... - and even too good to take over here. - I never said that. Huh? I just want to choose what I want to do. My dear girl, you think that you can choose? Let me tell you something. For people like us, it's life that chooses for us. [inhales through teeth] [cell phone vibrates] Where do you want to put up the posters? Wanna see something dope? What is it? You'll see. - Is it much farther? - No, it's right here. [thunder rumbling] [Victor] It's beautiful. [Sofiane] I used to come here with my brother. He is perfect. What do I have to do? [Obé] Push him. - What? - What did you say? - Push him? What are you talking about? - Kill him now. - [Victor] Who are you talking to? - I'm not killing anyone. If you don't push him, your brother will die. Sofiane, what's happening to you? - Who are you talking to? - I can't do it. You can't what? What are you talking about? - I can't kill him. I can't do it. - [Victor] What? - You're scaring me. - Stay here. Stay here! If you don't push him, your brother will die. Go get him. Hang on, I can't... [panting] - Get him. - Victor! Boo. [screams] [Sofiane grunts] [Obé] It's your brother or him! [grunting] [Obé] Finish it. I know it's hard, but do it for Reda! Do it for your brother! This is your only chance! [grunts] - I can't. - [coughs] I can't. I can't. One life for another. You have to sacrifice one to save your brother. Go on, Sofiane. What if it were mine? What if I was the sacrifice? Huh? What if you took my life? [breathing heavily] Grandma, are you okay? There are too many clients these days. It isn't normal. - If I'd finished your initiation... - Not tonight. - Please, not tonight. - You'd feel it like me. [sighs] There's something in the air. Something bad is coming. [Obé] Someone has to die tonight. [coughs] Come on, jump. Come on, Sofiane. Reda will know what you did for him. - Swear that you'll save him. - I will. - [Sofiane] Swear it! - I swear. But I need a murder. No, stop! - [grunts] - [both groan] No, Victor, fuck! - Let go of me! Let go of me! - Don't do this. It's not a solution! Why did you come back? What are you doing here? Let me jump! You have to jump, Sofiane! Murder! It's the only solution! But a suicide isn't a murder! [Sofiane] Huh? - What? - A suicide isn't a murder! [Sofiane] Huh? Obé? Obé, is what he said true? Answer me, God damn it! Obé! I was gonna throw myself off the roof. You fucking son of a bitch, I was gonna jump! I don't have all the answers! What? I take care of murdered souls. I transport them. World of mortals. World of the dead. That's it! What? [coughs] [growls] I need a murder in order to go back home before we disappear. Me and Reda's soul. "Reda's soul"? What do you mean? Where is Reda? - Where is my brother? - He is with me. Do you want to see him? Watch. Help! Help me! Somebody! [sobbing] Don't do this. I'm begging you, don't do this. [whimpers] Stop! Stop! I swear, nobody will know. I won't tell anyone in school. No! No! No! [Sofiane] Reda! Reda! Reda... You killed him. - You killed him. - [Obé] No. I only came to collect his soul. You can still save that part of him. So get yourself together! [breathing heavily] I live here. You're going home? Did you see what I saw? He's dead. Reda... is dead. How am I gonna tell my parents? No one will know. I will. I'm going to go. - Bye. - Wait! [whimpers] Sorry. I can't stand being touched. I'm really sorry. Jesus, Victor! Hey. Do you know what time it is? - I was seriously freaking out! - Sorry. Look at you. - What happened to you? - Nothing. No, Victor, wait. That wasn't the deal. You have to tell me what's going on. You can't shut me out. Come on, don't make me be the annoying mother. I was with a friend. Is that okay? [sighs] A friend? That's good news! - What's his name? - Sofiane. [sighs] Bad time? I was doing something. Are you okay? Yes. Ever since you got out of the hospital, you paint when you're not okay. And now, you're painting. Doesn't make any sense, but okay. I'm fine. I promise. I heard you cried in class. [sighs] It's good if you're finally owning up to being weird, Victor. That's the only way you're gonna make friends. See you. [doorbell buzzes] [dog barking] [whispering] Are you insane? My mom is sleeping. - Please let me in... - No, you're crazy. Mélanie... Drop dead, okay? Please, what's wrong? For once, you suggest doing something normal, and you stand me up? It's not like that. - Please, let me in. - Who do you think you are? You think I'm gonna run after you when you give me attention? You don't give a shit about me and I don't give a shit about you. What? We're gonna stop seeing each other. Wait. What are you talking about? [woman] Mélanie, who is it? Nobody, Mom. Go back to bed. Go on. All right, come in. Come in. [kissing] [both breathing heavily] [moaning] [panting] [cell phone vibrates] - I bet he came home. - [Céline] Yes, just now... Sorry to have bothered you for nothing. You didn't. Is he okay? It's hard to tell with him sometimes. Hmm. Did you manage to stay calm? You know me. [chuckles] - He was with a friend. - Who? Sofiane, I think. [sighs] Hmm. Okay. I'll try to talk to him tomorrow, okay? I didn't dare ask, but thanks. - Thanks. - It's my pleasure. - We'll talk again tomorrow? - Yes. - Good night. - Good night. [typing] VOODOO CULT A BRIEF SUMMARY OF VOODOO USING YOUR BLOOD TO INVOKE THE GODS THE VOODOO BLOOD OATH [sighs] [school bell rings] [indistinct chatter] Move. Come on, move. - Luisa. - What do you want? We need to talk about your grandma's business. Why are you talking about my grandmother? Last night, I looked on the Web - and I read some stuff about voodoo... - Stop bugging me, please. The thing where you make sacrifices to get what you want. - Is that clear? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Leave me... - There's all this shit with blood, right? That's what attracts the gods, that's what's valuable. So I was thinking, instead of making a sacrifice to control people, could you control... a god? I don't know what you're looking for, but it's very dangerous. Even I wouldn't do it. You need to stay far away from all of that, Sofiane. Believe me. Don't worry. I was just checking the rumor. You and your grandma are actually just bumping off kittens... You've got a nine. Get out of my classroom. You've got no business here, Sofiane. [gasps softly] [Sofiane] Obé! Sofiane, what are you doing? Obé! - Wait! Why are you calling him? - Obé! Sofiane. Has the mortal been thinking? Yeah. And now, you're gonna listen to me. You need us to kill somebody? - I'll do it. - Sofiane! I'll do it! But the only person I wanna kill is the son of a bitch that killed my brother. Nobody else. You help me find out who it is, - and I kill him for you. - Stop! - Don't say things like that! You can't... - I can't what? For my brother, there's nothing I won't do. Nothing. [Victor] I can't stay here. So? - Obé? - It's a deal. - But you'll have to do a blood oath. - An oath? Yes. But there'll have to be two of you. You shouldn't have gotten rid of your Good Samaritan. [Sofiane] Victor. Hey. - Wait for me. - No! Victor! - You can't leave me hanging like that. - No! He's going to help us. I can't stick around when you say you're going to kill someone. You think I want to? - You strangled me yesterday. - That's the thing. I know if I come face to face with that piece of garbage, I won't be able to stop myself. So I need you, Victor. I need you! You have to stop me from doing it. You can't trust him. I don't trust him. But I trust you, okay? We're gonna turn Obé's shit upside down, okay? He's just gonna help us find the guy who iced my brother, that's all. [Sofiane opens box cutter] [Sofiane] We'll make the oath but we won't kill anyone. - [blade slices] - [Sofiane groans] Here. Go on. [whimpering] [groans] Squeeze my hand. Come on, fuck! If this goes wrong, can we back out of it? Come on! [Victor] Sofiane? Sofiane? [yells] So let's talk about Rastignac again. Native of Angoulême, he settled in Paris to pursue legal studies. He's an ambitious young man who looks at the high society with both surprised and envious eyes. And he will show us that he will do anything to achieve his goal. So today we can say that the term "Rastignac" indicates a social climber. And all this leads us to the concept of meritocracy. Since Kada looks so interested in what I'm saying, maybe he can answer the question? Uh... Sorry, sir, I didn't hear. I was talking about meritocracy, a concept that no doubt escapes you since, despite your efforts, the administration continues to allow you to stay in this school. - [Sofiane] I know what it is. - Do you now? Yes. It's a state where each individual gets what he deserves. That's correct. Did you slam your head against a wall, Kada? [students laugh] [softly] You're the one that needs to slam your head against a wall, asshole. [straining] - [male student] Mr. Bobinet? - [female student] Sir? [students gasp] [indistinct chatter] [breathing heavily] - [groaning] - [students exclaiming] [theme music playing]
