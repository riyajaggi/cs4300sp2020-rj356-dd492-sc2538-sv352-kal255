 Hi mom. Let me take that.  You must be careful with the foot. - Now I have anyway already brought it up.  - Honk when you are at home, I have said. So that the whole neighborhood  can stare at the cripple? No thanks. I have to leave for work.  The traffic is horrible. Are you going to show you in public like that? - What do you mean? I am a security guard.  - You look like a ragamuffin. So here it is, mom. I take my job seriously.  But nobody takes me seriously. No one can in any case say  that you make yourself apart. One step at a time, Mom. After the Games  , I might get a job as a police officer. I believe that when I see it. Okay mom. See you. An audience with soul in the blood!

 - till Jack Mack and the Heart Attack! Hello. Here I with water.  Tell me if you want more. Do you want? It comes  to drink when it's so hot. Okay. Stay safe. 16. Prepare Now! - Hello. Here you get water.  - Thank you. Hello. Not? Is it good? - Here you get some water.  - 17. Prepare Now! You there! We can not have any other  than those needed up here. - Hey ...?  - One moment, sir. - If you please go?  - One moment, sir! Hello there! You litter in my park.  This is not a dustbin. - I must ask you to go from here.  - Or else what, pretend cop? You and your friends have a choice. Either you give you on your own  or as I call to me the police. Bye... - Excuse me.  - Mr agent! - Excuse me.  - I need assistance in my zone! - What is it now?  - Some types of disturbance. - Where?  - Gone in those pews. Okay ... Excuse me.  Excuse. Thanks so much. Hello there? Hello!  Are you going to make trouble? - Then it was arranged. Have a good one.  - Thanks so much. Excuse me, but you forgot your bag! Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.  Excuse me, sir. - A backpack has been left behind.  - Take it to the lost and found department. It looks suspicious, sir. My guidance is to secure the area.  Call ATF team. We find 300 bags a day!  Take it to the lost and found department. If so, may I ask you  to give yourself away backpack. - I just follow my instructions.  - That's when the hell ...! James? We have a backpack here.  Can you post here ATF guys? Ladies and gentlemen,  may I have your attention. We need to vacate this zone.  Then head to the park's center. - What happened, Donaldson?  - The guy thinks he's Rambo. Let him have his moment in the spotlight.  The poor thing is security guard. We go and help. You should get back to your seats. I guess the beer, condoms  and snacks. There tends to be this. There tend to be everywhere. - A bomb. It is primed.  - You are joking?! - It has a timer.  - How long do we have? It does not. We must evacuate.  The explosive charge is very strong. If it explodes dies all  that is left in the area. Do you understand? Move your outward circle. Be resolute,  but do not tell anyone about the bomb. We can not risk  that panic breaks out. Can we get all the park's center?  A situation has arisen. Go to the park's center, young man.  If everyone can go to the park in the middle! Thanks. It's an order.  Everyone in this area! - Go forward!  - Shut up, fat boy! Move forward! Towards the middle of the park!  Stir you to park my! Thanks. - Why have not vacated the tower?  - What are you doing?! Are you mad? Attention! This is not a drill.  Then head immediately to the park's perimeter. Leave your belongings!  A situation has arisen. This is not a drill!  We must leave the tower in this now! - Follow me!  - I'm in charge of my gang! Go away! Stick.  Get to the park's outskirts! Go now! This is not a drill. No panic. Hurry up, sir. No panic. We go  to the park's perimeter. Follow my voice. - In the park ... What do you do?  - I'll get my car keys. No, we have here! Down! Oh my God...! You saved me. You're all right. Stay there.  I have to help the others. Is everything well? Everything all right, officer? Yes, it's okay with me. - Mom ...!  - Stay down. You have been hurt. - Mom ...?  - No problem. Medics here! - no pulse.  - Mom ...! Listen to me. You will survive  but must lie still. May I ask your name?  Fallon's your name? My name is Richard. I want you to look at me.  Let me not with his eyes. Breathe. Can you handle it? Breathe.  You are really good. We'll wait here.  I am with you all the time. We go. Richard? Go home. - Do they have my testimony?  - Go home and rest. You did good. FBI HEADQUARTERS  WASHINGTON, DC I want to say to the President  that the FBI has the situation under control. 150 people are wounded, two dead  and the perpetrator goes free. All Olympic facilities must be secured. ATF, GBI and local police  running around like dizzy chickens. It increases the risk of further attacks.  Brennan and Knox will go down. - Roger that, sir.  - Yes, sir. What I say to the White House? Keep flying off course.  All the forensic evidence will to DC No investigations.  Put everything in the bag and send it. We do not have time to mess with the ATF. Well then. Take over the crime scene.  Now it's ours. - I'm going now.  - Wait. You need your protein. I love you. Be careful. Do not forget to eat. FBI investigates whether people convicted of  second bomb attack may be of interest. Bomb design often gives clues,  as in the case of the Unabomber. - Do you have all your equipment?  - Yes, sir. I know. Either you listen to the press  or the bomb. Both can not. - You sound like my dad.  - worse - I sound like my dad. Inform your staff that the FBI  take over responsibility for security during the Olympics. Agents Holliwell  and Embry from ATF. You have to leave the site. FBI takes over. We came here when the bomb was discovered.  But we are happy to cooperate. There is nothing to it.  Take your staff and go. What are you doing, guys? Get out, ATF! If you want to use  , you can help to secure the area. You are in innocent blood. Here are the clues  to who did it. I do not care who is responsible  or who takes the credit. But Joe and I to our cause.  It would be foolish not to use us. Especially as the bomb had more tubes  and a powder charge of at least 2 kg. It should have been big enough  to fill a military backpack. Ven did you talk to?  Who is leaking information to the ATF? Are you kidding? I listen to the bomb. Your guy just took up a buckle  belonging to a military shrink. And you are standing in the rubble  of a femcentimetersrör. Of the deployment and powder charge  to judge, I guess two or three moves. Such a large explosive device  must have nitroglycerin, not gunpowder. Stop! There is gunpowder everywhere.  Look between your feet. Take the magnifying glass, you'll see. Smokeless powder. Spherical.  Of smell to judge ... Accurate Arms. - But I could be wrong about the brand.  - That we have to analyze the computer. Yes ... So I also used to think. But after 500 bombing investigations  , I do not get involved with that. It also taught me  not to judge a book by its cover. Whether for bombs  or people. I also thrive best in the lab.  Doctor in Chemistry. I did not understand even  if he was a hillbilly or Yoda. But Earl began the age of 17  and has worked on over the 5000 bombings. You need his help. Do you need gloves? Joe. The bomb shrapnel fragments spread  all the way to those windows. If I was a bomb ... ... and takes me all the way there  with a powder charge ... What do you think? - We have already searched the hole.  - I'm sure. Say something. - What the heck is that?  - We have to find out. - We'll take it. Excuse us.  - What said? - Excuse me. Go away.  - Come on...! You confiscate our evidence. All evidence  must be sent to the FBI. You then send bags  filled with soil to DC? Incredibly! ATF has its main laboratory  here in Atlanta. There are at your disposal.  You are there in 30 minutes. It is on the FBI's lab  in 60 minutes by plane. We demand the country's top laboratories,  not just any lab anywhere. You'll take part of the results  as soon as the data analysis is made. We continue to work.  We take individual pictures of everything. LATEST NEWS: Bombings  in Centennial Park Many injured but only two dead  in a terrorist attack during the Olympics. The stadiums are empty  of fear of new attacks. Our images show how the Dream Team  flee the city with their families. Empty arenas at the Olympics.  Dream Team escapes my city. Should I be remembered for this ?!  Holy shit! That's how it is. But you must take the hit  until we find a scapegoat. - Are you ready?  - I wanted to avoid the crap Nacka. I intend to issue a promise. I'm not leaving until the perpetrator  of the terrible attack is arrested - - and we know which  who with their negligence allowed it. Together we will  call them to account with certainty - - that their negligence does not cost  our city and our country more lives. Strong words from Atlanta's mayor.  Centennial Park is still closed ... They say that the park is closed!  The whole damn park. Yes ... but I want to be ready  if they need me. Where to pick up litter. A security guard discovered the bag  and started to evacuate the area. Who are they talking about? According to sources, he saved hundreds of  visitors from serious injuries. Hello, Richard. Bradley Cronin  from AT & T's public relations department. I am your media manager.  Nice to meet you. What? We see this as a unique opportunity - - to communicate our employees'  extraordinary feats. Your story has received  great response from the media. In fact I have  booked you on CNN this afternoon. - Should I be interviewed on TV?  - Yes, on CNN. Gosh ...! I'd rather not be seen.  The others are bigger heroes than I am. Richard ...? Can you explain to me  what the hell this man talking about? Has not he told you what he did? If your son  had not acted so quickly - - would be an estimated  400 people have been killed. - My Richard ...?!  - Take the piano. Many did more than I do.  They showed more courage - - and saved more lives than I do.  I was just doing my job. That we can work with.  I have a new uniform in the car. Comb your hair and change about.  You should be on national television. You should have been here  20 minutes ago. He is here! - You have the cap on you?  - I do not know. What do you think? Fast, fast. We run about 30 seconds. If I can not practice a bit first?  I thought that I would get help. Just look into the camera. God...! He needs made up,  but we do not have time. Are we done? - This camera. Who am I talking to?  - Drive! ... from the studio in Atlanta. Why  took you suspect, Mr. Jewell? Took ...? There was hubbub  front sound and light tower. Some men disturb the other visitors.  I saw a bag under a bench. We tried to evacuate the area,  but it was a bit problematic. A little problematic? What do you mean? They listened to a concert,  and we acted with care. We did not want to create panic  or the like. We managed to get the  150 visitors before the blast. - You did everything you could?  - Yes Lady. I only wish  we had been able to get off all. I mourn the victims  and hope that the culprit is arrested. We did everything we could.  I'm definitely not a hero. The real heroes are the policemen  who protected victims. It was amazing  to see the rescue workers at work. Did you have sufficient training  for the task? Yes Lady.  I worked in the police for six years. I came to Atlanta  to work during the Olympics - - and hope to have the service of the police here  if there are any vacancies. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Jewell.  And a big thank you for your efforts. Thanks. I made a fool of myself. Can you apologize on my behalf?  See how I look ... I will not lie.  You have many virtues - - but you do not lend to the TV,  it is God's truth. - What are you doing?  - What? I've washed your hands. - Use ladle.  - I'll do it my way, Mom. Use ladle. - Answer the phone.  - I will. I do not have cheese on it.  It is Richard speaking. - You do have the TV on?  - You just do your job, but I ... Turn on CNN immediately. Your interview is a success.  They play it over and over again. CNN presents you  as an everyday hero. - We forge while the iron is hot.  - I do apparently hit. USA Today, Boston Globe, Reuters ...  And the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. If they want to talk to my Richard? It's just the beginning. Katie Couric  wants you to "The Today Show". Soon all know who Richard Jewell is.  I have to hang up. I worked in the police for six years.  I came to Atlanta for the Olympic Games - - and hope to get a position  in the police here after the Games. My goodness...! With us are agents Brennan and Knox,  Atlanta police and the mayor. How are FBI Director? Thank you for your support, the mayor.  How far have we come? We've sent the ATF.  GBI and local police are subject to us. Good. Where do we stand in the investigation? Initial tests show that the bomb  contains readily available parts. We are looking for young people on the site,  but they will probably not be involved. Are there not hundreds of cameras  around the Olympic Park? Hundreds of cameras,  but only six VCRs. The guards had their own responsibility  to start recording. And they only played in  events ... special interest. - What does "special interest"?  - Tits, sir. We have 400 hours of big breasts,  but not much more. We are investigating several extremist groups  and an Islamist terrorist cell. They are said to have dealings  with the identitarian movement. The Ministry of Finance is angry that bin  we threw out the ATF. Vague suspicions  against right-wing extremists will not do. We need a clear suspect  before the Olympics are over. It is more urgent than that.  I want to open the park in the morning. - It will be more difficult ...  - You betrayed us! You betrayed the whole world.  All that the city is safe. "We have taken the villain.  Go out and celebrate on the streets of Atlanta." We heard about six hours back,  and every six hours thereafter. - Thanks.  - Sir. Colonel! Who is that man?  Why was not I informed? Forget it. We do background check  on a witness. He refuses to give up. Background checks on the witness?  And who refuse to give up? He is the principal of Piedmont College,  a Christian school in the boonies. He was the former employer  to the security guard Richard Jewell. A principal has information  about the man who found the bomb - - and do you think we should forget? It is for precisely this reason  that the FBI does not delegate responsibility. The headmaster? You can go now.  I'm Agent Brennan from the FBI. You will learn details about Mr. Jewell. When I saw Jewell hailed as a hero  on CNN, I wanted to inform you - - Richard Jewell is a madman.  I was forced to fire him. - What was the cause?  - He pretended to be a police officer. Richard Jewell is a fanatic.  He's dangerous. Come to my colleague.  I want to hear the whole story. McAlpine may do criminal profiling  at Jewell. Go to the Jewells hometown and talk  to people. We need information. They take the evidence,  it flies to its swish lab - - but can not find a thing.  No clear conclusions. FBI running their evidence on all computers  and spectrometers they have - - but find nothing of value. - Maybe there's nothing to find.  - There are lots. We have found a strange piece of metal,  plastic foam and a spray nozzle. But it solves nothing of a computer!  You have to roll up our sleeves. Build a dummy, I know.  It usually you like. The thing is that the boss is sour  over to the FBI snatch case. He gave us permission  to recreate the bomb in detail - - as long as we do not  use the service equipment. Very good, this.  I really mean it. I hope  you do not ask for it, I think. I just received the order  on my batting knitting equipment. Nice to meet you, Trudy.  This is Carolyn done. - In return for that we have to work here.  - Your new to-do list is long. - You are also in trouble, Joey.  - Yes Lady. Next time you need a separate lab  you get to your garage, Joe. Yes, ma'am. Lift the other end. - What the hell is this?  - A quilted stitching table ... I think. We wear it to the living room.  Beware that car. You know what? We leave it,  and she will take care of it. Now. We talk a lot about serving God  and their neighbor with heroism. Last night was a member  of our congregation with CNN. A member who practice what we preach.  Stand up, Richard. "No one has greater love than  to lay down his life for his neighbor." And nobody walks alone  along the way of righteousness. Bobi, please stand up  and receive our praise. You have brought up a son  of the hero of an entire country. Jewells employment history.  A little up and down, you might say. His certificate of registry.  A couple of involuntary commitment. Offender group  produces a profile in this moment. In addition, tell a friend  Jewell that he should have said: "Look for me on TV.  I'm involved in that soup." Right.  The same guy gave me this. Far to hell! We have you.
