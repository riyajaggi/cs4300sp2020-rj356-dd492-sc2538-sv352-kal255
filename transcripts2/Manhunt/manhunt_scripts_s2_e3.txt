 No no no! Stay lying down. It will be OK. The ambulance is on its way. - Let me help you. - I come from the ATF bombing unit. It is a crime scene that I am investigating. I'm investigating! - Are you okay? - Hi, Joe. It was another bomb. About 50 were hit. It could have gone worse. The car took most of it. It must have been TNT... and nail... We'll take care of you. Now, listen! Get the wounded away from here! - You're hurt! - Explain who I am, Joe.

 I need new gloves. These are broken. It's your own blood, Earl. Take care of him. Start working, Joe. Secure the car! It was a nail and a kind of steel wire... You're a lucky guy. - How many are cops? - Pretty much everyone. Turn your arm. My watch has stopped at 15.25. When did the first one go? 14:50? I think. Sit still. Are we done? I have to move on with the work. No. I have removed the superficial but the rest needs to be operated out. Do I die from it? Well. Save it there. It is evidence. - They don't understand... - It should be fine. Joe Holliwell! How long has the car been here? - Should you be out here now? - Yes. How long?

 The car belongs to the man over there. He arrived at 1pm. There is a methadone clinic behind. He parked quite randomly in front of a bomb. Unfortunate. If he hadn't, I would have been dead. The first bomb was aimed at the clinic. The other was aimed at the abortion doctor who usually parks here. The perpetrator had put hours on the bombs. They were supposed to be released at the same time. But it doesn't matter. The doctor was free today. The methadone guy took his parking lot. The bomber missed his target and got the hat on the Honda. - Were both bombs in hours? - Alarm clock. The methadone man parked two hours before the first explosion. How many were injured by the bomb in the abortion clinic? None. The abortion clinic was closed. I guess the first bomb contained about two kilos of TNT. - Just under two kilos. - Just under two kilos... And no one was injured. And exactly... 35 minutes later - - detonates bomb number two. Powerful enough to destroy the car. I can smell it. It must have contained at least nine kilos of TNT. Yes, and... What does that mean? The second bomb was not aimed at a parking lot. And the first was not aimed at the abortion clinic. It was a diversionary maneuver. The Honda destroyed his massacre. It is an L-shaped ambush attack. The first bomb lured the victims and the second killed them. It is no coincidence that there were 35 minutes between them. It's the time of the police call - - at major events in Atlanta's suburban areas. There has never been an L-shaped ambush attack in the United States. It is too difficult to implement. So you mean that the bomber knew exactly where we would stand - - who would be there and when? At the minute? Yes. If the Honda didn't happen to be there - - that would have been history's biggest police murder. The bomb tells us that the abortion clinic was not the target. That was us. I will call back. COME TO ME BILL Did you read about him in Marietta walking around with a concealed weapon? How can this be a news story? I have a shotgun in my pants. Do you have? Then saw it over. - You wanted to talk to me. - Yes. You get a new assignment. A rapist in Buckhead. There is panic among the suburban women. - I'm busy with Jewell. - You're being taken by Jewell for now. I've had his story since day one. People love it. We can write about Jewell for the rest of our lives - - but half a year has passed. People have moved on. I gave the newspaper its first national profile ever. All alone. At least give me a great story. There is not enough for my team. The team is disbanded. You return to local news. I'm better than this. This shit is what sells newspapers. No one working here does not intend to sell newspapers. Look around! Where do you think we are? Nobody who works here wins a Pulitzer. Neither do you. How inspiring. Write it in the editor's head. Our time in the limelight is over. Now you go to Buckhead and sell some newspapers. Well. Now I get it. Would you ask Michelangelo to carve out a birdbath? No! He is allowed to create Pieta. Definitely. The Sistine Chapel and all that. I predict, with you as witnesses - - a newspaper that lowers its ambitions has one foot in the grave. I can help you with Buckhead. Maybe the ladies will talk to you. I'll fucking at Buckhead. Give me something new about Richard Jewell. So... - It's nothing big... - Out with it, F.X. I have a friend. A woman. We are not lovers or anything. She works at the alarm center. Please just shut up. There are rumors of an alarm call the night the Olympics bomb exploded. They played it for each other because it was so much fun. It's probably nothing, but I can ask her about it. Hand me. Your hand. My home address. If anything, come on. Day and night. I give. Charges are waiting, but I will not wait. I will sue Richard Jewell for exposing others to danger. We demand justice. What should I do, Watson? I have no money to give them. I have $ 80, am a prisoner in my house and am compared to O.J. Simpson! We have to put tough against hard on TV against those assholes! - They'll slaughter me if I go out! - Shut up, Richard. - I have to hang up. - Okay. - Don't open up while I'm here! - It's the food. Mother? Oops. I'm 60 years old. I have worked hard all my life. Why is this happening to me? What have I done to deserve it? Look at me! - Watson is trying to fix it. We... - He doesn't know what he's talking about! He is a loser who wants to be a hero, just like someone else I know! What do you mean, Mom? Do you think this is my fault? The FBI waded into my house - - and stole all my good pans and my pot - - so I have to eat that shit off the floor! They don't do that to innocents, Richard! - Don't take it. - I've changed numbers. It's Watson! Only him has the new number! Take care of you, you bastard! I'll come tonight and kill you. I slam your cock down your mother's throat... - Where are you going, Richard? - Buy food. I'm not a prisoner. - Do not. - I have not done anything. Everyone else must act. I haven't eaten vegetables in an eternity! It's him. You wanted to blow the Olympics in the air. I buy food. Let him be! The children sit in the car. Came! Let him be. What on earth has happened to you? I have dreamed of becoming one of those who come to the rescue. Some FBI agents were watching as I was being beaten. I didn't even resist. They glowed, like I was a dog! I must keep a low profile and let justice go its way. But if it's okay to kick me, it must be enough! No one comes to the rescue. Now I'm starting to fight! Yes! That's what I want to hear. Tomorrow we rush into court and sue them all! The media, "AJC", Tom Brokaw, the FBI! They blow on your rights. We are suing the life out of them. I do not want to. I don't want money or revenge. I want my life back! We have to sue them so you get your life back. Nobody takes words again, apologizes or acquits you - - if they are not forced to do so. Do you know why we have habeas corpus? Why not just drop the Constitution? Because brave people throughout the history of the country - - has said and used the system to force people to correct. It is our job to make sure that yet another heroic security guard - - don't suffer like you suffered. Okay. We will do it. The plug puller is in the kitchen. The emergency center. What happened? There's a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes. - Do you want? - I'm taking a break. He claims a bomb explodes in half an hour in Centennial Park. You big Chinese! Do you have the address at Centennial Park? - Why should I have it? - Is it good enough? Good enough? It is fantastic. Good morning. My notes on Buckhead. One of the victims is willing to give us an exclusive interview. A personal story of violence along with the rankings, of course. Well done. Just take my team, but let me keep writing about Jewell. - What the hell... - Listen to this tape. I am old enough in the courtyards to know when a story is not over. That call is only the beginning. I put the rape material at Leer. In the local department. Look right here, honey. I found it in Sandy Springs and have never seen anything like it. Four steel wires held together by some form of support. It is not conductive, so there was no insulation on it. There's a kind of burnt, melted plastic on. A kind of green PVC. I do not understand it. Where should it sit? What is it used for? How the hell did I know? I do not know. I thought you might have a theory. Or would like to help me with that. This... is my love language. For heaven's sake, that is. What the heck are you talking about? I read in an article that there are five love languages. My love language is... If you leave women's leaves at the toilet, you have to take the consequence. - I love you, but you're crazy. - I do it as best I can. I know. And that's fine. Pardon. It's Joe. - It's happened again. - Where are you? Outside of a lesbian nightclub. It was a small bomb. No one was injured but it is TNT and an alarm clock. I think that... - That is it. - Piss. I hang up. - Evacuate the area. 25 meters. - The place is secured. No, there's one more bomb. Get away. Now! Joe Holiwell? Joe Holiwell! Hell, Joe! - Five wounded, but no one died. - It's thanks to you. Well done. I've learned from the best. What is that? - The same as in Sandy Springs. - I don't understand what it does. A witness saw someone at the container. He was lying on the ground, but got up and fled when the bomb detonated. A homeless. The bomb must have scared him. - It's TNT. - Yes. He was here. - Piss. - Look there. He couldn't see the nightclub. Only its real goals. He is after us. And he doesn't give up. Not until one of us is dead. Sandy Springs. Otherside Lounge. Where will he hit next? Have no idea. - Is that the legal distance? - About eight meters. Don't do it, Mom! Your child loves you. - You have a choice! Choose the love. - It's a nurse, Minzor. How can she kill children every day? She looks so cute. Take it easy. - Have you taken Dave's guard? - Yes. - Have you taken Nancy's? - She has had children. - We're so easy. - I can't. It's not too late. Don't murder children today. - The fog horn is back. - People are different. - Minzor's not a bad guy. - Can you see it there, Sandy? Just look. I can't handle more rubber limbs after last week. As soon as the halloweentings are set down, the tosses arrive. Maybe it's the gardeners. Emily! Don't die, Emily! Help! Help! Don't die, Emily. It should be fine, Emily. I promise. Do you think I did? I support life, not death. Holliwell and Embry from ATF. Have you been looking for more bombs? Yes, throughout the area without finding anything. - How's the nurse doing? - Critical, but she survives. Look here. It's him. But no other bomb this time. And no hours. He likes to look. Look here, Earl. Imprints from boots. - They're fresh. - Young Holliwell... He is nearby. The arrogant suckling pig. Look here. Oh God. A remote trigger. That's why he didn't use a timer. Especially that he left it. He is, as I said... an arrogant man. He evolves... and learns all the time. The first two did not kill. He has improved. An ambush attack with hours is replaced by a bomb with a remote trigger - - so he reaches his goal. Tell the local police that they can let the protester go. The clinic was not the goal. The target was the valet. He wanted to see his face. Brennan? Come here. I'll be right back. An abortion bomb in Birmingham. A local police officer has been killed. He has turned to a gay bar and an abortion clinic. The case has a lot of media attention. The White House convenes the press. - And now we have the responsibility? - Exactly. Five authorities are involved. Handle it like the Olympics. - Can I take Agent Knox with you? - You get what you want. It is urgent. The White House and the relatives are watching us closely. Knox! Come with me when you're ready. You have to kick ass. Through 23 centimeters of concrete here... A plastic container on the ground. Does it make sense? Now comes the FBI. Just in time to take credit for that. We are on the same page. We have several clues, including the car model... The interview stops here. Thanks. You are visiting my area! I'll talk to the press if I want to. The perpetrator is watching right now. Are you saying we have his license plate, he gets rid of the car. We do not take advantage of slain police officers to bask in the television. Listen! The FBI is taking over the case. Everyone else should be gone. The other side of the shutdown, please. Leave the area. We are agents and have the right to investigate the matter. What we are looking for is not here at all. Came. We drive. What are you looking for? In addition to the remote trigger, it's all like the other two. A plastic container, tube with nail, TNT. It all fits. The spread has not looked like this before. The perpetrator changed strategy to kill the officer. The bomb's spread shows that he changed the construction. But how? We have combed the area. 200 meters in all directions. There is no more. The white house with brown roof and "for sale" sign. Just look. Bring my bag. It is a lie. - There we have the answer. - Holy shit. I have seen many pipe bombs in my career. Do you know how many of them have had a directional plate? Three. One of them we found in the 1960s in a swamp in Florida. One of them is right here. The third we found half a year ago in Centennial Olympic Park. It's the same thickness. Double plates. We must examine the bomb in the laboratory to be safe. But... they look undeniably similar. So the one behind the bombs in Sandy Springs, Otherside Lounge - - and right here placed the Olympics bomb? I'm not saying that. But that bomb shown. Loud and clear. Richard Jewell can't possibly stand behind these car bombs. He is being monitored by the FBI around the clock. Yes. Could he have had a mate? One that is still on the loose? A mate that Jewell never communicated with - - before and after the Olympics, and whose existence the FBI cannot prove - - after months of hearing everyone Richard Jewell has met? It is possible, but unlikely. If you are right about the record, they got it wrong. It's even worse. If we're right, the FBI's publication of Jewell - - the real bomber full freedom of action. I'll take it. ABC will have an interview related to the case. - Hi, Marsha. - Hi, Watson. Jewell and I are just refining our case. We'll go to court tomorrow if you want to film it. Do you or Richard have a comment on the big news? - Which one? - The one in "AJC". - New revelations by Kathy Scruggs. - I will return. According to Scruggs, Jewell telephoned a bomb threat - - just minutes before the bomb detonated. She has found a recording where Jewell says to the emergency center - - there is a bomb in the Olympic Park. - Why didn't the FBI say that? - Why weren't we informed? The intention may have been to attract more witnesses to the heroic act. Richard Jewell is obsessed with police and getting known. The sick thing is that he called for the police to run against the bomb - - and watch him play completely. He hung to fame over the officers' lives. He didn't care if people died. He wanted to satisfy his ego. They are back. From this phone, the bomber began his acting. The anonymous call went in shortly before 1am. - From that phone? - Yes and so what? Even more lies! I'll add that to the case. Oh God. - They're wrong. - What did you say? I can prove it.
