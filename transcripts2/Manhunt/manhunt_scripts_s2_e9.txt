 So, tell me, fellas, what you doing here in Nantahala? I think they want to get disappeared. I think they're out here 'cause they want to be friggin' hostages down in the goddamn hole. Don't you? Or maybe they want to be mounted heads up on the walls, huh? - Is that it, assholes? - Eric Rudolph - bombed the Olympic Games. - Shut up! - You speak when you're spoken to. - He's planning another major attack here in Nantahala, and you will either be collateral damage or the target itself.

 Bullshit! We know from Eric - himself that he... - Hey, hey, hey! Everyone out. Come on. Let's go. Out. Let's go. That report - is evidence that links... - Did you not hear him? He said speak when you're spoken to. Besides, I been in ironworks 25 years. I know steel. So y'all just shut your mouths and let me read this. What in the hell's going on, man?! He's sitting down with them Feds. Why would he send us out, huh? I mean, what exactly is he trying to hide? No. Eric already told us he has no explosives. Yeah, and he also told everyone he was a pro-life, pro-family bomber of empty buildings, but you can see for yourself. You know, there were babies in strollers there at Olympic Park. Is that why you came here today? To show me this? - Yes. And... - And to tell me that Eric Rudolph is a psycho or something? You've spent enough time with him that I'm guessing you already suspect what kind of a person he is. Rudolph has played me, and he's played you. He's pitted us against each other, created a war between us, and it's working. Because he's preying on our fear. He's betting I'll take one look at you... Your clothes, your accent... And dismiss you as a dangerous, stubborn hillbilly. And he's betting you'll look at me... My clothes, the way I talk, my badge... - And think... - Elitist, self-important, smug liberal douchebag who thinks he can swagger into any small town and wave some dollars around and get everybody to suck his dick and vote for the Clintons. Uh-huh. We need to get past that. We need to rise above that. Eric Rudolph doesn't believe he's a soldier of God. He-he believes he's a god unto himself. He will eliminate anyone who challenges that. Anyone. And as long as we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him. We're not stopping him from executing his bigger plan. Eric doesn't have a bigger plan. Look at that receipt. Right in there. Does that mean anything to you? Nope. It means he has parts for eight major bombs. Which it's fair to assume are live and planted somewhere in Nantahala. Uh... Hmm. Someone must've bought this shit for him. - Y-Yeah. - Yeah. Not my men. That's what we figure. 'Cause I know you want to do the right thing here, just like we do. You... invaded my town. You attacked my wife. You drove me and my family out of my home. And now you want to come here and talk about, what, you and me singing "Kumbaya" together? Do you think Rudolph is just gonna stop here? You thinking he's gonna blow up a few bombs in Nantahala, kill a bunch of FBI, probably a bunch of the militiamen, too, and then just stop? He is just getting started. And as long as you and I are at each other's throats, he can slip right out of Nantahala and vanish. Then he's gonna keep on bombing, and we don't know where. Could be a gay club, could be a homecoming parade, could be an abortion clinic, could be a Little League game, a church, a school. Could be another cop with a six-year-old son at home. Could be another mom out celebrating her daughter's 14th birthday. And that blood will be on us. You and me. He's selling us out. He's in there talking to the enemy and he's selling you out and he's selling me out and he's selling out Eric Rudolph. He's betraying everything we stand for! We have rules about this. You know we can remove him from command. Yeah, but it's Big John. So? "You shall know the tree by its fruits." As far as I see it, our so-called leader's behind closed doors having a secret meeting with federal agents. Shit. Spread the word among the lieutenants. Get them ready for a change in leadership. Hey! - Come on, Buck! - Dale. - Come here, come here, come here. - Jason. Eli. Hey. Good boy. All right. Let's find this guy. Where you headed? Going to warn Eric Rudolph. Get 'em suited up, get 'em gunned up. Let's roll. Eric! Are you out there?! You got to know, you're being sold out! Right now, there's a Judas collecting his 30 pieces of silver from the Feds! Are you there?! How good you think you are? You think you can catch his scent? All right. Come on, baby. Go on. Try it. Find him. Find him. Find him. Got it? Got him? All right. Worth a try. Buck, dude, you sure you're not chasing a possum or something? Come on. Let's go. Come on. Shit. All right. Let's go. Badge. We got a problem. My men, they ain't gonna work with no Feds. The stuff in this file don't mean jack shit to anyone who ain't in this room right now. We need to talk, Big John. Well, Buck, I owe you an apology. - We called a council. - Oh. You called a council? A war council. Like in our articles. It's our right, as members. I see. And you're the chairman of this war council, I take it? I speak for everyone. We want the Feds. We're gonna take custody of 'em and decide what to do with them, as a group. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. Give us them Feds. Or what, Charlie? Or you're deposed and we'll court-martial you for goddamn treason! Take those Feds now. Who's next? - Guns up. - Hey! - All right. - Dale, secure the hostages. And get 'em down now! - Down! Down! - Face down! - Down now! - On the ground! - All right. - Now! - We're down. We're down. John Gray, you are officially deposed of your command. Interlace your fingers and place your hands upon your head. Now. Charlie, have you lost your goddamn mind? Interlace your fingers! Place them on top of your goddamn head! - Now! - Pot Boy to base. Pot Boy to base. Guys, I'm at grid Bravo seven niner. Send the boss up here now. There's something he's really got to see. How-how did you find this place? Buck. - Who's Buck? - Best nose in Nantahala. Doctors and lawyers from the big city offered the kid $30,000 for that dog. He told 'em to shove it where it don't shine. Hey, come here. Hey, you stay where you are. That's a lot of dynamite. He's been playing us. Eric Rudolph has been looking into my face and lying to me this whole goddamn time. I mean, he's been lying in this cave with all his dynamite and all his guns and all his shit, probably laughing at us every goddamn night. What'd they tell you? They tell you he bombed the Olympics? - Yup. - And you believe them? Yeah. My sisters were there. My little sisters saved their tip money to go down to goddamn Atlanta Olympics on a Greyhound bus. They were in the damn park. That goddamn piece of shit! I mean, he played us for goddamn fools. So what's the plan? These Feds gonna help us find him? That's the idea. You're gonna help us find this asshole? Yes, we are, and we're gonna make sure he rots in prison for the rest of his life. Not if I get a shot off first. Go check out his pin-ups. Looks like he's got a hard-on for somebody, huh? Shit. - Here. - Uh, uh... I gave him that map. Yeah. That's all our positions. He said... Wait a minute. Let me see that. Hey. Well, what does this mean right here? I don't know, but it's damn close to the base. That red writing... It ain't mine. We got to move. We got to move. Get the scent now. Go on. Get a nice big whiff. Good boy. Halt! Get your hands up! Weapons down! Now! - Screw that! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Keep 'em down. Be ready. Let's go. Stop! Do not take another step! We are FBI, and we will take you down if you do not comply! Knox. Sorry. Stand down! Stand down! Do notstand down! Stay alert, safeties off! What the hell is going on, Jack? Just talk to me. Look, we found evidence that Rudolph is working up in these ridges. Our base is a quarter of a mile away. Eric Rudolph is not here. We would have found him months ago. - Wait. - You're being used, Jack. Now, I don't know what happened or what they've said to you, but the enemy is using you to get access to our base, and I cannot allow that. No, no, no. Listen to me, all right? They're helping. Look at what we found. If you have doubts after that, then... Doubts? You are guiding a paramilitary leader under federal indictment, plus armed militia soldiers, right into our zone of confidence. - They're not the enemy here. - They are! They're the goddamn enemy, Jack. You put me in charge of base security while you were absent. I am obligated to keep the base secure. If I feel my commanding officer is compromised or is of unsound judgment, I have the right to commandeer this mission. I know you do. And I know you're trying to do the right thing. But listen to me. The situation has changed. I'm not backing down my men, Jack. And I'm not letting the enemy one inch closer to the base. Now, if you have a location you need verified, I will verify it. All right. All right. Want to look at the map. - This is your base right here. - Got it. Don't let them one step closer to home plate! And you, take your men and back it up. And if I see one weapon up, we will take you alldown. Boy, I hope she can read his map, 'cause this bunch is about to... about to go. Knox to HRT. Stand down. Repeat... stand down. Weapons down. Brennan, sir, you need to get up here, quick. Holy shit. He's been watching us the whole time. You knew about this? No, I-I just found out half hour ago. This is a map of y'all's base. There are seven controllers, not eight, and he's out there. Agent, you need to get your people inside and buttoned up. Now. Knox to MovCon. Knox to MovCon. You need to get every guard and agent inside the base now. Clear the whole perimeter. And we need EOD teams deployed immediately. Get Joe Holliwell on point. He's good. He'll make you safe. Find ATF Agent Holliwell, put him in charge. There are possible live devices. Repeat. Multiple live explosive devices in close proximity to the base. Turn your radios off. Bomb. Y'all need to back it out of here, up over that ridge. Keep 'em off till you get there. Now. John, I believe you have a knife. I need to borrow it. Thank you. Keep 'em off till you get to the other side. Okay, Earl. Here we are. Okay. It's all right. It's all right. Phew. It's all right. Oh. Did not know I was gonna be here, baby. Did not know that. Shit. Phew. That's it. On that side. Oh. You clever son of a bitch. Got a re-router, didn't you? Boom. Oh! Goddamn it! Shit! This is Embry up here. The bomb's clear. - The bomb is clear. - Bomb's clear. Bomb's clear Embry. Are you all right? Yeah, I think. He just triggered the remote, while I was pulling it out. That means he's close. What's the range on those controllers? Embry, what's the range? It's about a hundred yards. Uh... Oh, Jesus... Knox, he's within a hundred yards. He's close. FBI, fan out. Work with these guys. Regulators, fill in the line. Move! Listen to the lady. Son of a bitch is close. Let's move! Come on, Buck, let's move. You got him? Okay. Hey, buddy, go get him. Eric, you shot my dog! Hey, Buck, you okay? God, do not do this to me. Buck? Buck? Hey. Hey, you okay, buddy? All right, okay, okay... Hey, you better run, Eric! You hear me? We will not stop! We own these woods, and we will not stop till we hunt you down! You hear me?! Could be somewhere in here. Spread out, men. Check it out. Those are my goddamn maps. Shit. Holy smokes. So close. Arrogant bastard. - All right, get it covered. - Copy that. All clear? All clear. Light it up. Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! It's safe. Repeat: bomb one is rendered safe. Moving on to second device. This was the biggest one. And there was a directional plate. I don't have to tell you which way the blast was focused. Right at your front door. How the hell did he get so close? 'Cause I gave him the map. Handed him the keys to the goddamn kingdom. And he was just... laughing at me the whole time. You know... I used to imagine exactly this. That the enemy would come in exactly like this... like an invasion... Build a base, oppress a people. And I would recognize him right away for who he was, and be able to fight him... with this. I-I just, I just thought it would be... so clear. Big John. Go, Variable. Boss. You'll want to see this. Right up here, Big John. EMBRY and BIG JOHN: Food cache. Let's cut one down. Yep. Food. There's got to be a couple hundred pounds of food in that alone. So much for starving him out. Ten miles from the nearest road. He must've been preparing for this for years. Way before he blew up his first bomb. And that's just in this one camp. How many more you reckon there could be? Would you like to do the honors? Think he's watching? God, I hope he is. What do you want, one of them little umbrellas or something? You know, moonshine is illegal. If I find your still, I'll be obligated to confiscate it and keep it. No, you... you're never gonna find this still, not with a thousand years of looking. So, what happens next? Well, I'm gonna commit career suicide by going on national television. I'm gonna call a press conference. Charge Eric Rudolph with the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. Washington will have my head for it. But it's the truth, and people need to know. You know, I'm gonna be removed from this operation. Probably from the FBI. But... you know how important it is that we keep going, until he's caught. We won't stop. We're not hunting him for you. We're hunting him for us. Let me ask you a question. Why'd he do what he did? You know, I mean, I can get my mind around blowing up that nurse and such. She deserved it. No offense. But the Olympics and then here. You know, I mean, all of it, taken together, why in the hell would anyone do all that? For the record, I don't think Emily Lyons deserved it. To your point, you know St. Augustine? Went to a Jesuit high school, and... we read St. Augustine. He was trying to figure out, if God is good and all creation is good, - then why does evil exist? - Why does evil exist? Right. And what he came to was evil, in fact, doesn't exist, the way darkness doesn't really exist. It's just the absence of light. Well, same with evil. It's the absence of good. See, you take away goodness, take away humanity, compassion, humility, you take all that away, the black hole you're left with, that void of nothingness, that's evil. That's Eric. So, basically, you're saying Eric Rudolph is just a plain old grade-A... asshole. Philosopher king right here. Yeah. He's just a grade-A asshole. Amen. Amen, indeed. Morning, everybody. Thank you for convening last-minute like this. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has instructed the U.S. Attorney's Office to bring federal charges against Eric Robert Rudolph for the Atlanta Olympic Park bombing on July 27, 1996, which killed two and wounded 111 men, women and children. This offense, along with the other bombings Rudolph has been charged with, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and/or the death penalty. I again stress the FBI presence here in Murphy, as well as the Nantahala National Forest, is solely to bring this killer to justice. Thank you. What about Richard Jewell? Does the FBI still consider him to be a person of interest in the Olympic Park bomb? Our attention is entirely focused on finding and capturing Eric Rudolph. I can't comment on Richard Jewell, though I will say Eric Robert Rudolph is the only named individual on this indictment. There's no indication that Rudolph had a coconspirator or a collaborator in the Olympic Park bombing. Are you saying the FBI was wrong to investigate Jewell? The FBI has a responsibility to investigate... The answer to your question... Yes. How Richard Jewell was investigated was wrong. It was procedurally unsound. 138. I deeply regret that his name was leaked. - 138? - That's all I have. Thank you. Oh, that's me. Richard Jewell. Look... It's not like I haven't been trying. People see your résumé, see your training... Okay, the-the guy looks great. But... then they see your name. Well, wait a second, now. I was just exonerated on national TV. Surely, that has to mean something. I'm not picky. I'll do anything. I'll flip burgers. I'll work demolition. Just get me in a room for an interview, at least. Nobody wants to interview you. Look... Look at it from their perspective. You got two résumés. One is from Joe G. Schmo, a former security guard you've never heard of. And the other's from Richard Jewell, who may or may not... be a terrorist. That's not how it should be, but it's reality. Nobody's gonna hire Richard Jewell. Well, you're wrong about that. I have a lot to offer. I'm loyal and I'm conscientious and I take my work seriously and I believe in serving others. Now, it might take me a little while, but, at some point, someone is gonna see past all the BS and all the lies and see me for who I am. And I'm not gonna give up till I find that person, sir. Good luck. Thank you, sir. I know. I know. Come to the point where there was no other option. Have you gotten the call yet? Not yet. But it's coming. Look, I'll tell Freeh you had no part in it. The hammer will fall on me and me alone. I hope. You really believe all that? What you just said to the press? Every word. Sir, I profoundly disagree with how you've conducted the latest phase of this manhunt. And I absolutely cannot get behind disobeying our director's orders. I think that goes against everything we've been trained in and everything we swore to when we became FBI agents. I would have made very, very different choices in directing this operation. But what you just did is one of the most courageous things I think I've seen in my years with the Bureau. Going up that mountain and going in front of those cameras took tremendous moral courage. I respect that deeply. And I hope that I'll be able to find that in myself when the situation calls for it. Thank you, Knox. I owe you an apology for what I said out there in the woods. You were not compromised or of unsound judgment. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Well... Well, since you're taking over, uh, let me show you something. Aside from our active search areas, tomorrow, the regulators are gonna look into these grids here. We think he has a few survival caches stashed in this range here. So the Bravo and Charlie teams are gonna try and intercept. It's working. It's actually working. Well, we haven't caught him yet. And, uh, there's still a ton of wilderness out there. But, uh... yeah. It's working. Run, Rudolph, run. Will you do me a favor? You tell the director I'm-I'm not here. I've gone AWOL and you're trying to find me or something. I want to go back out there one last time before I have to pack it in. Well, let's hunt this bastard down. Let's go get him! Spread out!
