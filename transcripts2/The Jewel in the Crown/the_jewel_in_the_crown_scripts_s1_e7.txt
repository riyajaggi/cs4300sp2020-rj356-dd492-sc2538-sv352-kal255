 The Jewel in the Crown (1984): Season 1, Episode 7 - Daughters of the Regiment - full transcript 
 Still in Calcutta, Sarah accepts Jimmy Clarke's invitation to attend a party and finds a somewhat mixed crowd. She also finds that Clarke isn't quite the gentleman her aunt Fenny made him out to be. In Pankot Mabel Layton reveals to Barbie Batchelor why she and Mildred Layton do not get along very well. She also tells Barbie that when she dies, she wishes to be buried next to her husband in Ranpur. When she dies soon afterward, Mildred won't hear of sending Mabel's remains all the way to Ranpur and orders Barbie to leave the house as soon as possible. Mabel's sudden death causes Susan to go into labor.

 Three-star, you see. This is the other side. That's Pyari on the sitar. The Woman in the spangled sari is a maharani but suing for divorce. The Englishman is her legal adviser but I imagine it goes no further. That boy Whose head he's fondling looks like an AB from a ship of His Majesty's Service. It's a Way for boys like that to see the bright lights. Oh, Well done! Jimmy, the Movement Control telephoned. The Colombo plane leaves half an hour earlier. I brought somebody. Her name's Sarah.

 - Hello. - Pyari's in good form, hmm? He said they've asked for him at Government House. - Will he go? - "Only With a bomb in his sitar. "But Why ruin a good instrument?" So that's that. - Mira's a stunner, isn't she? - Yes, beautiful. She keeps her husband in drink, pays his gambling debts and his mistress's clothes and jeWellery accounts. Does she? Why? Why not? She's so rich, she can't count it. Anyway, she likes his mistress. They Were lovers. Mira has friends in Cairo. That's hoW I found this place. It's my unofficial address in Cal. Has Mira got friends in Ceylon too? - We both have. - Then you'll be nice and comfortable.

 It is one of my aims in life. Isn't it yours? Yes, I suppose it must be. Well, that's refreshingly honest. That honour of the regiment exterior is paper thin, isn't it? Didn't the injection take? It's usually fatal. GroWing up With the po-faced kids in a ghastly nonstop performance of Where the RainboW Ends. And you escaped? I suppose that's hoW it looks. It's only half the truth. What's the other half? Last Christmas, I Was in Pindi With someone Who's been here for years. We Were tremendously polite. I had nothing to say to him, his Wife or tWo of the po-faced kids. They'd been trapped in some perpetual EdWardian sunlight. I felt I ought to say, "Come back, all is forgiven." Come back Where? Forgiven by Whom, and for What? For What? Don't you knoW? This place is a goldmine but it's stiff With people dying of hunger in the streets - the legacy of the bible-thumpers Who couldn't stand the commercial pace back home. I'll give it another tWo years after the socialists have Won the next election. Who Wants India as one of our postWar problems? Are you a socialist? Good Lord, no. A loW Tory, if you could call me anything. Why are you so sure the socialists Would Win? Won't Mr Churchill's reputation count for anything? Women alWays call him Mr Churchill. It makes him sound like a vicar. Of course his name Will count for everything patriotic and time-expired. I don't suppose you've talked much to common British soldiers. The felloWs you refer to as BORs. I'll tell you What your BOR in Deolali or With Wingate in Burma thinks. He thinks, "All right, mate. You're the officer. "Have it cushy While you can but When this mess is sorted out, "be a good lad and bugger off out of my government and my bloody life." He thinks his oWn lot should run things because there's more of them - more than there are of la-di-da poofs sWigging brandy and getting hot for Women that they don't knoW hoW to poke. Go on. You're quite a girl, Sarah Layton. No, I'm not "quite a girl". I'm this one. And you're still a virgin, of course. Yes, I'm still a virgin, of course. Are you annoyed With me for asking or because you don't Want to admit it or a bit of both, hmm? In any case, clearly I must apologise. (Conversation in Hindi) Mira's doing us proud. It's Lakshmi Kripalani. She sings, if you didn't knoW. They're going to play again. - I'll shoW you Where to freshen up. - Good idea. They might go for an hour. - I'll keep this Warm for you. - Yes. Thank you. There's probably everything you Want. If not, just ring. A girl Will come. Thank you. You're going the Wrong Way. I'm over here. You do seem startled. Weren't you expecting me? - No. - That's a pity. I thought you understood We had an appointment. Mira did. So don't Worry about our absence causing comment. We had no appointment. Please turn on the light and open the door. - Are you sure you Want it opened? - Yes. The key's here. Oh, dear. Have I miscalculated? I don't often but it is an occupational hazard of the male. You get a feW slaps but you also get screWs, so you can't complain. You don't Want to lose that cherry? Quite sure. I'll give you one minute to unlock the door. You're not really plain. Quite pretty, really. In the buff, I expect your breasts look much more prominent. What I like best about you is that you never say anything obvious. That and your colonel's-daughter guts. I brought up our drinks. Do you Want yours? Not too much. Aunt Fenny told me that your mother drinks. It's embarrassing, isn't it? My father drinks a lot. What she should do is screW. That'd be better for the Colonel - not to come home to an alcoholic Who gets her screWs out of bottles. - Like your father. - Yes. Just like him. And What did your mother do for screWs? Oh, Mother Was never hard-up. She Went in for handsome chauffeurs. Go on, you're doing very Well. I hope you're not cross With Aunt Fenny. She Was trying to bring out my protective instincts. It's my fault she said too much. I realise that. Why are you shivering? Because I find it difficult to control myself. And you feel you must. What do you find difficult to control - your temper? Yes. NoW I'd be glad if you'd open the door. If the taxi's still here, I can go home Without putting you to any trouble. If not, you'll have to organise one. And you don't Want to lose that cherry? Very Well. I like your Aunt Fenny. She's shalloW. And I bet she Was a scorcher as a girl. Potentially, you are Worth 20 of her. But your brains and your toughness aren't Worth a bag of peanuts if you lack joy. That's What Aunt Fenny's got and you haven't. The place is stuffed With people Who've thought so long they've forgotten to be happy or people Who've spent so long trying to be happy that they haven't had time to think. Aunt Fenny doesn't think at all. She Wished you joy, that's all. And you don't Want it. She's my Aunt Fenny, not yours. My key for your Aunt Fenny. Catch. For Pete's sake, Sarah Layton, you don't knoW anything about joy at all, do you? No. No, I don't. You're crying. Why? Because you really Want me to make love to you? I couldn't promise love. You couldn't either, could you? And that's not right, Where you belong. Except that you don't. Do you pretend because your father's aWay? Pretend that you belong for his sake? No. I do belong. That's What I knoW. That's the trouble. Please take your hand aWay. You really ought to bathe your eyes, you knoW? My Aunt Fenny Would think the Worst if she saW you noW. Well, then... shall We go, Sarah Layton? Is it so sad? Sarah, be joyful. 'She is to visit Captain Merrick 'in hospital. 'I Wonder, 'Will she ask him this time 'if he kneW EdWina? ' Oh, can't you sleep either? I Was Writing. Letters. Can I get you anything? No. Thank you, Barbie. There's nothing I Want. (Mabel) I'm not sleepy though. It's rather close, isn't it? Just a bit. Perhaps you Were thinking about the neWs. That's Why I couldn't sleep. About the invasion. No. I Was thinking it's a long time since I visited the grave. My husband's grave in Ranpur. Did I ever take you, Barbie? Don't... go! - Stay and talk to me. - Talk? - What about? - Anything. About When you Were young. I alWays enjoy that. Do you? Do you? Oh. Well, I Was alWays a bit afraid of going upstairs to bed so I used to hum a song my mother disapproved of. ? I've seen a deal of gaiety throughout my noisy life. ? - Throughout What? - "Throughout my noisy life." Oh. One of your father's comic songs. Yes. He loved the music hall. He often promised to take me to it but never did. He Was afraid of What my mother Would say. And he Was alWays a bit short of What he called "the ready". One Christmas, he lost the presents for my stocking on the Way home. I adored Christmas mornings. Waking in the dark, feeling the Weight of the stocking on my toes. It Was magic. I remember that. Even the quarrels in our house had a sort of magic. My life Was never dull. Is it dull noW? NoW?! Least of all. What do you think Will happen When the War is over? Happen? Well, this house is much bigger than the grace and favour bungaloW. If your stepson, if Colonel Layton, is coming home, people are bound to think this Was his father's house and that the bungaloW's too small for Mildred, Sarah, Susan and the baby. I knoW Mildred hates me because she thinks... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You must go to sleep. Yes, I Will noW. Thank you, Barbie. I'll see to the other light. - Mabel? - Yes? Who is Gillian Waller? Gillian Waller? Sometimes you say it in your sleep. JallianWallah. JallianWallah Bagh. It's not a person. It's a place. The Amritsar Massacre in 1919, Where General Dyer killed all those unarmed Indians. - Was your husband there? - He died in 1917. - But you remember it? - Oh, yes. L26,000 they raised for General Dyer When they retired him. I sent L100... to the fund the Indians Were raising for the families of their dead. There Were more than 260 victims, you see? And 26,000 for him. So I thought L100 Was the price of one dead broWn. It's not you, Barbie, and not this house. JallianWallah Bagh. I gave it to the Indians. That's What she can't forgive. A daughter of the regiment. I'm ready for the light noW. Goodnight, Mabel. 'lndia's Minister of Information 'says, "We have trapped the enemy in the lmphal area. "'He must either WithdraW or be annihilated." 'These pictures from the Assam-Burma border 'take us into the hills of Manipur 'Where men of the 5th and 7th Indian Divisions are in action. 'Japanese-held villages are consumed by flames 'as his attempt to seize our offensive base at lmphal is thWarted. 'This is any man's country. 'Large opposing forces can Wander for scores of miles 'Without ever meeting each other. 'But When they meet it becomes a massacre. 'Japanese corpses are streWn thickly Where they fell 'after being caught in a merciless crossfire from infantry and tanks. 'They have no further interest in Tojo's gamble. 'For them, it has meant death in a strange jungle,000 miles from Tokyo.' (Birds calling) Memsahib. RickshaW is here. - Thank you, Aziz. - Memsahib come home? Seven, Aziz. Or seven thirty. Certainly for dinner. Susan? I've told Aziz you'll be here to lunch. Is your mother coming to fetch you? Mm. From the club. It's so lovely here. Bye, Barbie. Aren't you awfully hot? You should be in the shade! I like the sun. Where are you off to noW? - Mr Maybrick's. - Where? The organist. I told you. He Wants me to stick his volume of Bach together. It's all in pieces. Bach! I'll be back to dinner. Susan's here. When is Sarah coming back? She only Went the day before yesterday. She booked a sleeper for tomorroW night. (Mabel) Goodbye, Barbie. Are you aWake, Auntie Mabel? Auntie! I tell you, it's gone! Double page. The F minor fugue. Here's Where it should be. Are you sure you've looked everywhere? What a pickle you're in! Mr Maybrick, What are you standing on? What? Eureka! "Perseverance," my father used to say. Perseverance, Mr Maybrick, Wins the day. Angelic, Barbie. Ham-fisted, but angelic. What Would you say to mutton, curry and rice? - I should say no. - It Was planned! Mutton, curry and rice for tWo. - Planned by Whom? - Lovingly by me. - You've been overdoing the sherry. - You've not done so badly yourself. - TWo glasses are all I've had! - Refilled betWeen fugues. If you stayed to supper, you could start the binding afterwards. I shall do no such thing. You're becoming a hard Woman, Barbie. - I'm sorry. - Oh, Arthur! Mr Maybrick and I Were just... Forgive me, Barbie. Mrs Layton telephoned from Rose Cottage. "Stay With me and talk." I kneW! A stroke. Very sudden. I think We must believe she felt no pain. "Throughout my noisy life." No pain at all. Rose Cottage? Kevin Coley speaking. - Is Miss Batchelor With you? - No. She's not there. I'm telephoning from Mr Maybrick's. I told Miss Batchelor of Mabel Layton's death, suggested she stay at my house. She Was distressed and anxious to go home. Mr Maybrick and I tried to persuade her. She retired briefly and noW she's disappeared. Gone? Well, frankly, PeploW, not convenient at all. Oh, mystery resolved. Miss Batchelor's here. Yes, just arriving. Understood. Thanks for telephoning. Arthur PeploW on the phone. Seemed a bit concerned. I told Arthur I must get home at once. There's so much to do. Excuse me, Captain Coley. - Miss Batchelor... - I Won't get in anyone's Way. No! No! - Is that Susan? - Dr Travers is With her. I think she may have started. (Dr Travers) Much better, Miss Layton. - If there's anything I can do. - Thank you. I think We can cope. Have you any idea Where that bloody man is? - Which man, Mildred? - Aziz. Aziz! - Aziz Was here. - He's not here noW. If he shoWs up, Kevin's promised to boot him in the rear. But... but if he Was Worried... I don't think you understand Indians like Aziz at all. I understand only too Well. I've asked Colonel Beames to speak With the police. The police?! Whatever are you saying? Not that there appears to be anything noticeably missing. Dr Travis Wants you to help Susan to the car. OW! No, I don't Want to go! Terribly upset. No-one really suspects Aziz. It's just until Beames is satisfied as to the cause of death. - The cause? - He Wanted a pathologist's report. Excuse me. Where is Mabel? No! I don't Want to go! No! No! Oh, Mabel! Mabel! It can't have started. The baby isn't finished yet. Come on, Sue. Keep going. We'll have you right as rain. You'll see. Miss Batchelor? Miss Batchelor, Maybrick's here. They've come to take you to the PeploWs' for the night. Thank you, Captain Coley. Where have they taken Mabel? Would you mind telling me? General Hospital. Yes. Colonel Beames thought it Would be best. But it's all right. Mildred's there With Susan. I'm sure What you need is a good night's sleep. - Have you transport? - There's a rickshaW at the bottom. I left my bag someWhere. Oh, I've some receipts for bills I've paid. I'll put them in Mabel's desk. Perhaps you'll see that Mildred gets these. Of course. I'll pack some things. We shall go straight to the hospital. I must pay my last respects to Mabel, of course! I don't think that Captain Coley thinks... Captain Coley doesn't think at all. That's God's blessing on him. And I must speak to Colonel Beames at once. Sorry to have kept you Waiting. But I do have my pathologist's report noW. It confirm's my assumption of cerebral haemorrhage. Do sit doWn. Um... had she complained lately of feeling unWell? No. Not complained. I've told Mildred... uh, Mrs Layton Junior. She's here With young Susan, as I expect you knoW. I'm afraid from What Travers says, she's in for rather an arduous time. Fortunately, Captain Coley and Arthur PeploW have undertaken to make the arrangements for the funeral. There's a great deal to do. Do you knoW anything of the arrangements for transportation? - I Wish to accompany, of course. - Transportation? The burial Will be at St Luke's in Ranpur. She Wished to be buried With her husband there. - Hasn't Mildred mentioned this to you? - No. I... must see her and remind her. Are you sure those Were the elder Mrs Layton's Wishes? Quite sure. I see. I'll mention it to her then. Well, I'm afraid I must leave noW for Flagstaff House. But you can depend upon my letting her knoW. Are you accompanied? Mr Maybrick is With me. Good. You must try to get a good night's rest. This must be a great shock for you. I Wish to see her, of course. Can I do that noW? I'm afraid not. But if you ring tomorroW and ask for Dr lyanagar, I'm sure it could be arranged. - Dr lyanagar? - Or his assistant. Extension 22. Thank you, Colonel Beames. - Mr Maybrick... - I brought the suitcase in. Safer than With the rickshaW Wallah. Why don't you go back to the rectory bungaloW? Tell Clarissa and Arthur I'll be there in half an hour. Half an hour?! I'll Wait. Well, it may be longer. I shall ask. Colonel Beames Will have rung. I'm to see Dr lyanagar. Will you please tell him I'm here? Oh, but Dr lyanagar has left. Then his assistant. Extension 22. Colonel Beames should have rung before he left for Flagstaff House. You see, I don't remember. It's Miss Batchelor, isn't it? Get Dr Lal quickly, please. He Will come to the telephone. Tell him I'm here in connection With the death of Mrs Mabel Layton. As arranged by Colonel Beames, I'm to see him in his office. Barbie, What are you doing, for heaven sakes? Something I have to do. Dr Lal? Yes, I am Dr Lal. I Was expecting to see Dr lyanagar but I understand he's left. Yes, I'm sorry. Half an hour since. Some obvious lack of liaison upstairs. May We proceed at once, please? I'm sorry, proceed With What? Identification. I have to see and identify the body of the late Mrs Mabel Layton. I see. But no-one mentioned to me this necessity. - Are you a relative? - Yes. One moment. Please sit. Aah! Oh! Oh! You should have Waited. It is most irregular. I mean, nothing is ready yet. You come in Without permission. It isn't alloWed. NoW you're in a state. Please, you must sit someWhere and be patient. Why should I be blamed for this? No-one Will blame you, Dr Lal. I shall say nothing. It Would be Wise for you to say nothing. I have seen all I need. Forget I Was ever here. - But Dr lyanagar... - He knoWs nothing. She is in torment! Yes? Can I help? Sister Paige? Sister Paige is busy. I'm Sister MattheWs. Are you lost? I've come to see Mrs Layton. They told me to come up to number eight. I understood it Was Captain Coley With a message from Mr PeploW. They got it muddled. There is a message for Mrs Layton concerning Captain Coley. I see. And there, I've just told Mrs Layton it Was Captain Coley. Never mind. This Way. HoW is her daughter Susan? Mrs Bingham's as Well as can be expected. It's not going to be an easy delivery. She's so tense. Mrs Layton's awfully anxious too, trying to contact her other daughter in Calcutta. But I expect they're all out celebrating the Normandy invasion - What I'd be doing if We Weren't short-staffed. Your visitor, Mrs Layton. Come in, Kevin. Pour yourself a drink. It's on the dressing table. And freshen mine. What's happening? I got through to Calcutta, thank God. Sarah starts back tomorroW. Kevin? You bloody bitch! Mildred, please don't. It's not my fault they got the message Wrong. Do I look like Coley? Call me anything for What you think I've done but listen first or she'll never rest. Never, never! I've seen her, so I knoW. She's in that terrible place, in anguish, because she thinks you've forgotten your promise or Won't abide by it. She'll haunt me. She'll haunt you. All of us. I've no idea What you mean. What promise? - To bury Mabel at St Luke's, Ranpur. - What are you talking about? It's What she Wished. She told me. She must've told you. St Luke's in Ranpur? I knoW nothing about it. It's out of the question. Spare yourself the humiliation of being asked to leave and please go. Why is it out of the question? There's a telephone on that table there. Just ring Arthur PeploW and tell him. Tell him this - that she Wished to be buried With her husband. Arthur and I Will do everything else but that must come from you. What you Will do is leave this hospital at once and stop interfering. I find your suggestion utterly obscene. It's June. Perhaps you've noticed it's Warm, even in Pankot. I have no intention of having my husband's stepmother transported like a piece of refrigerated meat. If it Were in her Will, I should override it. - I knoW nothing about her Will. - I do knoW about her Will. I've had a copy ever since my husband Went abroad. This gruesome convoy you think she Wanted is out of character. After living With her, I'm surprised you didn't knoW better. On the other hand, I'm not. You Were born With the soul of a parlourmaid and that is What you remain. India's been very bad for you and Rose Cottage a disaster. You Will be out of there by the end of the month. As soon as possible, if you've paid. - Mildred! - HoW dare you call me Mildred! To you, I'm Mrs Layton. That's ridiculous. It's spiteful. Mildred is your given name, your Christian name. Christ! - No, please! - Let go. I'm sorry. Sorry! I am What you say. But I loved her so much. God gave me this last chance to serve Him through her. Please, Mildred! She asked for so little but she Wanted this. Why should I make up a story? I'll do anything, everything you say, but please don't bury her in the Wrong grave. Not that! Not that! Not that! Oh! NoW... I've told you. I shall need a little time to collect my things. Goodnight, Mildred. They've all gone noW. These are for her? 'Oh, my dear. That Was your mother. It's bad neWs. 'Aunt Mabel. I'm afraid she's dead.' Miss Layton? I'm sorry, Miss Layton, but We're nearly there. We're coming into Ranpur. Sorry to disturb you. Oh, no. Thanks, Mrs Roper. Don't rush. We thought you'd Want some time. - We only stay in Ranpur for 10 minutes. - Yes. I'll get doWn. Can you manage, dear? - You've had a good long sleep. - We nodded off too. You've been very kind. I'm afraid I Was an awful nuisance to you. Oh, my dear. Not at all. Your uncle in Calcutta seemed so concerned. Letting me share your coup?. - And letting doWn the bunk as Well. - NoW, just leave that. Directly after dinner, Mrs Perryman and I Will tuck doWn. Is there anything We can do? You'll Want food at the station? No. Really. The Pankot train doesn't leave till after midnight. Yes, I knoW. I think I'll just go and Wash my face. Yes. Freshen up. Perhaps she Wants to be on her oWn for a bit, in the circumstances. (Mrs Roper) I do hope there's something really pukka lined up for us in Ranpur. Personally, I alWays find trains famishing. Tea in the dining car back home Was best. Those little pots of jam. Do you remember? And teacakes! When We first came out, Roger's mother used to send us Tiptree's. - They're from Fortnum's. - It's the sort of thing that really counts. Though in Burma, it Was marvellous What We could get through Ramcham's in Rangoon. I mean, Jim's Special Marmalade. I say! Keep a lookout, Dorothy! I think We're here! Memsahib! Memsahib! I've got your coolie for you. After 0 years, I can alWays spot the one you can trust. Well, there's only my case. Thank you. I can see some restaurant-bearers there. I hope one's got our trays. Bearer! Bearer! Goodbye, Mrs Roper. - Thanks for everything. - Goodbye, dear. - Mrs Perryman. - Shouldn't We find an escort for you? There must be one officer We could Whistle up. I shall be quite all right. But surely you don't usually travel alone? Well, there's alWays a first time, isn't there? - Goodbye. Goodbye, Mrs Roper. - Goodbye! You knoW, Bunty, things are certainly changing. Well, they are. Bearer! Memsahib! Express to Delhi.
