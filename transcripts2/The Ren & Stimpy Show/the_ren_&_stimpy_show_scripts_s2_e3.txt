 ( narrator ) Come back with us now to those bygone days, when the west was brutal, untamed and lawless. It took a special breed of man to tame this country. Men with eyes like eagles, reflexes like a rattler, and the keen ruthless wits of a panther on the prowl. We's awful ignorant, ain't we, Ewalt ? And plumb proud of it, Abner. Ewalt ? Yeah, Abner ? What's ignorant mean ?

( dopey sounds ) From out of the long desert shadows, ride two dangerous desperados. Three-fingered Hoek, and his faithful sidekick, stupid, the kid. Duh, hello. Onward they ride. Raw, tough, desperate... small. Hey, Stimpy, let's go down to that little one-horse town and see if we can pick up some odd jobs, pillaging and looting. Pillage, pillage, pillage. Loot, loot, loot. ( Ren ) "Villins wanted." ( rings doorbell ) Excuse us, Mr. Sheriff. You needn't look any further, for it is we who are your villains. ( ticking ) ( "Jeopardy"-like theme ) Hmm... oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... say, why don't you fellers mosey over to my place and steal my horse ? 'Cause there is nothing worse than a horse thief. Oop ! He he he he. ( horse neighing & trotting ) Here is your horse that we have stolen. Gawd, Abner ! That's the ugliest horse ever I did see. ( braying ) Hey, that's no horse. That's my wife ! ( coyote howl ) Ah, you boys can keep her. Just remember to brush her and feed her twice today. ♪ She'll be driving six white horses when she comes ♪ hey, Ren, he reminds me of your uncle Eddie. And why is that ? 'Cause he's big and stinky. Hey, you shouldn't say mean things like that. Did you ever consider that this horse might have feelings ? Now let's steal that horse. Yee-haw ! Whoopee ! ( hooting ) ( grunts ) So, it's the old steal-the-horse bit again, is it ? All right, let's do it. If we have to. ( flies buzzing ) ( sloshing ) Hey, boss. These guys just stole me and... well, sir, I don't like it. ( "Jeopardy"-like theme ) They're horse thieves, you morons ! Horse thieves ! Horse thieves ! Hang 'em ! Hang 'em ! ( birds screeching ) ( sniffling ) Hey, Stimpy, I have a little confession to make. At night, while you're asleep-- ( sniffling ) I polish my boots with your tongue. That's okay, Ren, I wasn't really asleep. Ewalt, would you be so kind as to hang these two young fellers ? Hey, we can't hang those guys. The scrawny one don't weigh enough and the fat one ain't got no neck. Oh, who we gonna hang now ? I guess well have to hang each other. Ah ! Ah ! There's only one thing that we like more than hangin'. And that's singin' and dancin'. Come on, everybody, let's have a hoedown. ( all ) ♪ Ohh... ♪ ♪ the lord loves a hangin' that's why he give us necks ♪ ♪ it tightens up our vocal cords ♪ ♪ and loosens up our pecs ♪ ♪ so if you are a horse thief and guilty to the bone ♪ ♪ go ahead and blame a friend and you won't hang alone ♪ ♪ it may be hard to swaller ♪ ♪ but you'll be three feet taller ♪ ♪ and find new ways to entertain your friends ♪ ♪ you say you are a villain but can't abide by killin' ♪ ♪ go ahead and steal yourself a horse ♪ 2, 3, 11, "r", 5... sing it, boys. Ah-ha ! I'm a-pickin'. And I'm a-swingin'. I'm ignorant. And I'm ugly.

Swing a spell. Yeeee-haw ! ( music box playing lullaby ) You know, Stimpy, with your invention and my savvy, we'll corner the rubber nipple market. We'll be millionaires ! We'll rule the world !! Tsk, Ren ! I am not in this for financial gain. I have a dream... I believe... one day that everyone... everywhere... will know the wonders of my nipples. Fine ! You keep your dream, and I'll keep the money. ( tearing ) ( pop ) Now shut up and drive ! I'm driving ! I'm driving ! ( lullaby playing ) ( tires screech ) I can hardly contain myself ! Just where do you think you're going ? Duh, I was gonna sell some rubber nipples. You don't know how to sell anything ! You can't even whiz by yourself ! Now, stand back and watch a real salesman at work. Duh, okay, Ren. ( door opens ) Aaaaah ! I've had it up to here !! With the likes of you people ! Whoops. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were A... ( whispering ) Circus midget. I have a new dream, Ren. What's your dream ? That some day... that I will be as good a salesman... as you, Ren. Now shut up and let me do the talking ! ( locks unlocking ) Do I know you ? I don't think so. Would you like to take a look at some fine rubber nipples ? Did my wife send you ? No, sir. But you look like someone who could really use some rubber nipples. How do I know you're not from the F.B.I. ? Sir, I can assure you, we're only salesmen. All right, so I made a mistake ! One mistake ! Can't a man start over ?! Do I have to keep on paying ?! Aah ! Maybe I should make another mistake ! Maybe two more ! Please, sir, I think one mistake is plenty ! Just let me show you what's inside here ! Don't do it, man ! I'm not armed ! We really just want to sell you some rubber nipples ! See ?! Oh ! It is a nipple. Ha ha ha ha ! Oh, what you must think of me. Forget everything I said. So, nipples, huh ? Hmm... no, sir, I don't think I have any use for rubber nipples. I'll tell you what, though... do you have any rubber walrus protectors ? Call the police ! Ren ? Ren ? Ren ? Ren ? Ren !! What is it, man ?! Oh, please, can I talk at the next house ?! Can I, can I, huh ?! Oh, please, please, please, can I, huh ?! Get ahold of yourself, man ! All right, all right ! Shut up and get in the truck ! Joy ! ( lullaby playing ) ( truck door slams ) ( bonk ) ( door opens ) ( inhales ) You promised ! Hello, sir. Would you like to buy some shiny new rubber nipples ? I baked them myself ! Hmm... nipples, huh ? Let me ask the wife. Honey, are we short on rubber nipples ? Now, dear, don't you go buying new rubber nipples when you don't use the ones you already have. Well, maybe I would if they weren't all chewed up. Come on in, boys. Let's see what you got. Yee-hee ! Ah ha ha ha ! Ahem. Well, sir, you know rubber nipples have come a long way since you were a child. I bet you thought rubber nipples were just to put in your mouth. Well, yeah, actually. Well, nowadays, there's a thousand and one uses for my handy-dandy rubber nipples. ( drum roll ) Observe. ( Ren ) They're perfect for storing your hair trimmings. Now, there's something the little woman can use ! They're perfect for getting at those hard-to-reach places. Just amazing ! They make great finger gloves... for when you have to touch filthy and repulsive things. I have to touch filthy and repulsive things every day ! Don't I, honey ? Watch me now. ( snorts ) Nose plugs ! And they make wonderful rain hats. They protect your eyes from harmful U.V. Rays. And they make... great... ( pop ) Hickies ! Oh, man, wait 'til the guys at the office get a load of this ! Do you wanna sleep out in the yard ? You mean for a change ? Uh, are your knees cold, sir ? Why, yes, they are a little chilly. No more frosty knees, no, siree ! Wow ! They are warm ! Honey, how long have we been married ? And we don't have any of these ? All right, boys, here's five bucks ! I'll take the whole mess of 'em ! Five bucks ! Five bucks ! ( man ) Now get out ! ( both scream ) Ow ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Aah ! Ow ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! ( Stimpy ) Whooooa !!
