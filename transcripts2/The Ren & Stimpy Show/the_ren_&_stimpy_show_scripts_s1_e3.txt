 The Ren & Stimpy Show (1991–1996): Season 1, Episode 3 - Space Madness/The Boy Who Cried Rat! - full transcript 
 On their journey through space, Ren and Stimpy find that the true danger is "Space Madness", a cabin-crazy condition that Ren succumbs to. Next, in a sick tribute to classic animation, the two cook up a ploy to act as a rodent removal service. Ren becomes the mouse, and Stimpy as the cat. They take their services to suburbia with mixed results.

You poor, crazy kid. ( thinking ) Captain's log... I'm tired, so tired. I can't believe my own partner attacked me. Maybe... if I occupy his mind... with more duties, I can control his... space madness ! ( Commander Hoek ) Now, listen, cadet. I've got a job for you. See this button ? Don't touch it !

How can he possibly resist the diabolical urge to push the button that could erase his very existence ?! Will his tortured mind give in to its uncontrollable desires ? Can he withstand the temptation to push the button that even now beckons him ever closer ?! Will he succumb to the maddening urge to eradicate history at the mere push of a single button ?! The beautiful, shiny button ! The jolly, candy-Like button ! Will he hold out, folks ? Can he hold out ? No, I can't !!! Aahhh ! ( alarm sounding ) Tune in next week as...

Keep out of my trash ! I'm telling you for the last time ! A man works hard for his filth just to have vagrants come and steal it. It's a crying shame. ( sniffling ) Man, I'm starving. What are we gonna do ? We could find some work. ( woman screams ) Work ?! Have you lost your mind ?! I'm sorry, Ren. I don't know what came over me. ( cash register rings ) That's it-- I've got a plan ! What's the plan, Ren ? Well, we wait until dark, then we... ( whispering ) And then we...

Please allow me to make a business proposal. Oh, how cute ! Look, honey, a kitty cat. Isn't he adorable ? Yep, that's a cat, all right. Can we keep him ? He can catch mice. Don't be silly, dear. You know we don't have any mice. Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak, I tell you, squeak ! ( growling ) Man, that's the ugliest mouse I've ever seen. And he's beating up on our cheese ! All right, cat, you got yourself a job. Here, here's five bucks. Five bucks ?! Now, catch that mouse ! ( raspberry ) Oh, my-- will no one save me ? That's right, you're in for it now. Your days are numbered. ( falling bomb ) Yeow ! You're murdering me. Duh, you are in trouble now, mister rodent. ( woman ) Oh, dear ! I had no idea this would be so gruesome ! ( falling bomb ) Help ! The bad ol' cat is gonna get me ! Oh, help ! He is so fast and wily ! ( Ren ) Hey ! What are you doing ?! Put down that knife, please ! No, no ! ( woman ) Ohh ! No, I tell you ! Aaaahh ! ( clanging ) Ow ! Stop it ! Help ! Help ! Ouch ! I have got you right where I want you, you dirty old mouse. ( crashing ) ( Ren ) I'm free ! I've escaped ! Ha ha ha ! That nasty old cat will never get me now ! I am home free ! I have you now ! Oh, no, do not throw me out into the cold, dark night. ( man ) Hey, cat ! Aren't you gonna eat that mouse ? Well, go ahead, put him in your mouth. ( woman ) That's right, eat 'im up good ! Don't be shy. That's a good cat. ( woman ) Oh, look, honey, isn't that cute ? Well, go ahead, kitty, chew him up. Mmm... mmm. ( fart ) Yes, sir, he's really enjoying himself. ( woman ) Oh, honey, it's too big to swallow. Here, wash him down with this. ( car horn honks ) Teeth to the left of me... gums to the right of me. I tell you, I can't stand it ! I am going... mad ! ( squeaking ) Wharrrf ! Oh, honey, look. The poor dear has coughed up a hairball. Get me a tissue, will you ? Why, that's no hairball. That's that ugly mouse. Tell you what, hon, wash it off and we'll try again. That cat must be starving. Oh, no, you don't ! I am no mouse ! I'm a asthma-hound chihuahua. Well, by Joe, it is a chihuahua. Go on, Stimpy, he's got us. Give him back his five bucks. I can't ! I've been bad, Ren, you'll smack me. When have I ever ? Now, go ahead, tell me what's wrong. All this talk about eating made me hungry. I ate the five bucks. You stupid idiot ! You filthy worm ! You bloated sack ! ( woman ) And after you're done with those dishes, you can vacuum the rug, paint the lawn, mow the hedge, shave the chickens... hey, kids ! There's only five more days till yak-shaving day ! I can hardly wait ! So start decorating your house with disposable diapers ! And remember to stuff dad's rubber boots with coleslaw ! Then, on kilted yak eve, if you look real closely you just might catch a glimpse of the shaven yak on his enchanted canoe. But don't forget to leave a heaping bowl of hot lather by the sink ! Shh ! Whoa ! Hmm... ah ! ( humming ) ( Ren ) And if you've been a good boy or girl he just might leave a surprise for you to enjoy next morning. Just what I always wanted ! Shaving scum ! He got my letter.
