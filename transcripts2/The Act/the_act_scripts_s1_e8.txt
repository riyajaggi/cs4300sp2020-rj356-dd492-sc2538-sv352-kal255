 Did you look up at the sky tonight? And what did you see? Lacey, can we be friends? Heck, yeah, we can. My mama used to say, "Sometimes the only way out of the fire is through it." What does that mean? She meant you have to suffer. You'll learn more from it. Crap. - You saved me. - I saved you? - You did. You are a hero. - I'm a hero?

 Get back! Out of there! We have located Gypsy Rose Blanchard. And I want to say that things are not always as they appear. She can walk? Son of a bitch. Mom, I'm scared of the ghosts. I wanna go back home. It's okay. There are no ghosts. Hmm. Look, just look up at the stars. The stars are angels, and the angels protect us.

 And you are my angel. I protect you. Mm-hmm. And you protect me. This is the arraignment in the related matters of State of Missouri vs. Gypsy Rose Blanchard and State of Missouri vs. Nicholas Godejohn. Mr. Rippy, that's your cue to read the charges. Thank you, Your Honor. The State of Missouri hereby charges Gypsy Rose Blanchard and Nicholas Godejohn with first-degree murder, pursuant to section 565.020. On or between June 9, 2015 and June 14, 2015, the defendants did knowingly and after deliberation cause the death of Clauddinnea Blanchard by stabbing her, which is punishable by life imprisonment... Or death. Miss Blanchard, how do you plead? Not guilty. Neighbors expressed shock about the murder and years of deception. And detectives tell us they've never seen a case quite like this. Questions still remain on the nature of the crime, but Gypsy Blanchard and Nicholas Godejohn will both face the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder. Don't be scared, hon. We'll never give up on each other, like Bonnie and Clyde. W-what happened to Bonnie and Clyde in the end? Let's move. Um... they wouldn't really do it, would they? Do what? You know... um, execute me. They can. So much depends on public perception. If you look like a monster, they will probably seek the death penalty. But if you can appear sympathetic, they'll be more likely to go easy on you. That's one of the things I'm trying to help you with. There's a lot of evidence that doesn't look good for us, Gypsy. Witnesses... bus drivers, cab drivers, the waitress at the diner, that lady at the hotel, plus all of the text messages. I didn't kill her. Okay, um, all right. Let me ask you something else. We know that your mom forced you to use the wheelchair. But we know that you can walk, right? She wouldn't allow you to feed yourself, but we know you can eat. Do you think that there are any other things your mom might have told you that were wrong? I don't know. Gypsy, I've been trying to get a hold of your medical records so that we can see what the doctors said about you, not just what your mom said. But, um, I'm running into a lot of red tape. They're telling me that you signed some sort of power of attorney. Um, we might have better luck if a next of kin requested the records. So what about your dad? He's down there, right? In Louisiana? I've written and called a couple times, but no one answers, but maybe if you called him... I don't have a dad. It was only ever me and my mom. And, yes, I know... I know that she did bad things. But... But she cared about me. And she loved me at least. He didn't. We have to start changing the story. Right now the world sees you as a cold-blooded killer. But... but I-I couldn't have killed my mom. I love her so much. Then we need to get a hold of those medical records. We need people on your side, or the State of Missouri is going to kill you. Oh. Sorry. I'm wobbly. I spent my whole life in a wheelchair. You're gaining weight. Don't see that a lot in here. Can I ask you a favor? Um... I need to get a hold of my medical records from Louisiana, and I was hoping maybe you could try and get them because you're my new doctor. That's not how it works. Lie back. Shirt up. Oh. I think that I can get rid of this for you. Are you sure that's a good idea? You don't need it. Um, I've been having some aches and pains lately. Mostly my head and in my joints. And I know that sometimes that can be symptoms of infection. - Do you think it's related? - No. You just need some aspirin. The old doctor did that more gentle. I see people all day with real medical issues, like cancer and stabbing. You're one of the healthiest people in here. Sit up. Um, could I keep the tube? It's the last thing that I have of my mom. Well, it's biohazard now. Up against the wall! Let's go! Female inmates coming through! Move! Do you need to be told twice? Wall! Gypsy? Gypsy? I can answer the question. Bonnie and Clyde, they died together. They stuck together just like us. Together until the end. No, no. I don't want that. What? I don't wanna die! Hey! But we'll stick together, though, right? Jesus Christ! Because that's... that's why I saved you, is so that we could stay together. I said up against the wall, motherfucker. Move! NICK: G-Gypsy! Hey! What are you looking at? Look at the wall, asshole! I understand. It's just that you never... Hello? Lacey? Gypsy. Lacey, oh, my gosh. Hi! Hi. I'm so sorry I didn't call you before. I'm... I'm so sorry. I thought I would just be home so much sooner to be able to tell you everything in person. Everything on the news, like, that we were cheating people to get money and stuff, it's... it's not the whole story. I just... I just wanted you to know that. I mean, my mom... I guess she was, but as far as I... like, for me, my lawyer says it was basically a case of her, um, medically abusing me. So y-you killed her? Not... not like how they... they make it sound. I-I couldn't. You know that, right? Could you always walk? Like, this whole time? Um, can I tell you something? The first day that we moved in, ever since then, all I wanted was to be like you. And... And I really just need someone to talk to right now. I want to tell you everything. It's just really complicated. I... Do you think that... Do you think maybe you could come, I don't know, see me? Please? Um... Uh... I'll have to think about it. I'm... I'm sorry. I have to go. But... This bitch. Hey, one call per turn! You think these rules don't apply to you? I'm not here. Leave a message. This is your daughter... Gypsy Rose Blanchard. Um, I know that you don't even know me. But I'm, um, calling with just one little, tiny favor. I picked her up once to move her. Held her in my own two arms. The two of them sitting over there together laughing at us. Hmm, and stealing from Ronald McDonald. You ask me, she deserves the chair. And I don't mean no damn wheelchair either. They do it with a needle in Missouri. - Good. - Baby? This feel good to you? Everybody talking shit about them? Yes, it does. Fucking pissed. Every day that goes by, I'm more fucking pissed. Thinking about the two of them frauds taking advantage. No, they're worse than frauds. Emotional vampires, sucking people dry. Sucking their goodwill, their trust. You're just mad because you think you got everybody's number and they had you fooled for seven-straight years just like everybody else. So what if I am? Why shouldn't I be? She called me, you know? From jail. She did? When? The other day. It didn't even sound like her. I swear her voice was different. She wants me to come visit. You gonna? I don't know. What the fuck? - What? - I think that's my blender. - I lent it to Dee Dee last year. - Mom... What? I want it back. - It's mine. - The hell you doing? - Don't. - I'm going to get my shit. And if any of y'all donated your shit to these con artists, I suggest you do the same. Visiting hours start in 20 minutes. The following inmates please report to the security screening area... Adler, Beckham, Blanchard. Lacey. I had 'em take me to the vending machines. You always liked sweet stuff. I'm kind of nervous, Gypsy. Not sure what to say, you know? Do you remember me? I remember you, Dad. Can we sit? I didn't ask you to come here. Well, I wanted to. I know your mom's told you a lot of things about me. Please, I can't talk about her. No, I don't either. But here we are. Did you bring the medical records or not? But... Do you see here? "Mother reports that child wakes up choking several times a night." Yeah. Then there's this one. "According to mother, patient has seizures six times a week." And look here. "Mother says child was treated for leukemia at age three." Gypsy, that never happened. They're all like that. She always spoke for you. She always just told me to let her do all the talking. That was her whole tactic, you know? That's how she made you a prisoner. But at least she was there. She did love me. You... left. Gypsy... I was 17 when I married your mom. That's seven years younger than you are now. And she was a lot older. She was in the driver's seat, you know? I was a kid. I don't want to hear your excuses. I know that you left, and I know that you didn't love her or me. That's just not true. I did love you. Do love you, you know? But I... I didn't know how to do it. It was easier to just let her have you. For my whole entire life? I tried to come visit. Well, then you must not have tried hard enough. She said you couldn't handle it. And then she moved. Kept moving around. Th... there was always some reason. I think you should go now. Thank you for the records. That's all I need from you. Can you... can you please go? Every month I sent the checks. Every month, even when we were scraping for it. - I had to borrow. - Can I go now? Wait! Wait. Wait, wait. Just one second. Okay? Gypsy, please. I got to show you something. This is a few days after you were born. I never held a baby before. This is you when you were three. I was trying to teach you a song. This is you and me at the Special Olympics. You're eight here. I-I was so proud of you that day. That's not how I remember. That... you weren't there. - I was. - No, you weren't. Mom asked you to go, and you said no. That's... that's not true. I-I came. I gave you this flag you're holding. I remember the flag. I thought you would. You kept it for weeks till it broke. I remember thinking I should get you another one. But at the end, I forgot. I guess I forgot, too. Oh, Gypsy, I... I'm so sorry. I'm so, so, so, so sorry. I wish I had gotten to know you. This is a pre-trial conference in the matter of the State of Missouri vs. Gypsy Rose Blanchard and the State of Missouri vs. Nicholas Godejohn. I understand counsel has a motion to make. Your Honor, I've shared with the prosecutor medical records which show that my client was the victim of lifelong medical abuse at the hands of her mother. Dee Dee Blanchard was forcing her daughter since at least the age of five years old to pretend she was sick at great physical and emotional cost to my client. On that basis, Gypsy Rose Blanchard is entitled to have her trial severed from that of Nicholas Godejohn. The circumstances of this crime were not the same for both of them. She was an abused child being imprisoned and controlled by her mother, whereas Mr. Godejohn... Uh, counsel, before you get into it... - Sure. - Let me ask the prosecutor if, uh, he concurs. Um, I do, Your Honor. Miss Blanchard's, uh, circumstances differ... significantly from Mr. Godejohn's. Thank you. The, uh, defendant's motion for severance is granted. Uh, Gypsy Rose Blanchard and Nicholas Godejohn will now be tried separately. But I-I did it for Gypsy. I did it to protect... All right, settle down. Counsel, have you made a decision yet as to whether you intend to seek the death penalty against either defendant? We haven't, Your Honor. We're still reviewing the materials provided us by the attorney representing Miss Blanchard. We should be able to complete that in the coming weeks and come to a decision. That concludes the matter at hand. We will take a recess. Um, but that's good, though, right? They're gonna read my medical records, and they're not gonna give me the death penalty? Well, um, Gypsy, what we hope for now is a deal. You plead guilty, you maybe get to walk while you're still young. Guilty? But I'm not... But what... I'm a victim. That's what you just... That's what you said, right? Blanchard's lawyer says she is not a cold-blooded murderer but a victim of long-term physical and psychological abuse who had to break free. She says it's a case of self-defense. My client almost never got to talk. Not once. Not in any of the medical files I obtained. This is a case of Munchausen by proxy, and Gypsy is a victim... You know, I told her about that website where she met him. Look, she lied to us. It's okay to be mad. No, I'm... I'm mad at myself. There were so many times I-I feel like she told me stuff, and I just thought it was all in her head, all some fairy tale. But this whole time it was just right in front of us, and I... I didn't even see it. Christ, it's like she heard us. Are you gonna pick up? I was thinking. Yeah? Maybe you should go see her in there. Why would I do that? Aren't you curious? I mean, after all those lies? Don't you kind of just want to look her in the eye? She ain't coming. I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have come either. Well, I'm happy that you did. It's really nice to see you. You don't have to be nervous around me. Still the same old Gypsy. I don't know who the old Gypsy was. You were always so nice to me, Mel. I used to always think, "I just wish that Mel could be my mom." And now maybe you can be, 'cause... 'cause I need one. When did you know? Know what? That you could walk. That it was all a con, that you were taking money and charity from people when you didn't need it. Um... I don't know. I just... Well, I trusted her, you know? I mean, she was my best friend up until she... wouldn't let me grow up. But... I always really loved her. Then why didn't you just get up out of your chair and walk away? Why did you come here? I guess to see if I still recognized you. Do you? I don't know. I can't understand it. You and her all those years, all those lies. No version of it makes sense to me. Well... Well... I truly believe that everything happens for a reason. There is no goddamn reason this happened to you. There's no reason. Sometimes we can't make things better. We just gotta live through 'em. I guess that's right. I can't be your mom, Gypsy. You're on your own now. You hear what I'm saying? Does any of this make sense to you? Yeah. Who are you, Gypsy? Do you even know? You don't always want to be the person she made you into. Sometimes the only way out is through. _ Did you look up at the stars tonight? Hmm. And what did you see? I saw all the stars hanging up there. You remember that night? Huh. The Spanish moss in the trees... looked like ghosts. And it scared me. And I held on to you. Mm-hmm. And I told you... "Look at the stars and not the ghosts." Because the stars are angels... And the angels... protect us. And you are my angel. And you protect me, and I protect you. Mm. What's the matter, huh? Good night, Mom. Good night, baby. Good night. Oh. Mm. Don't hurt me, sweetpea. Okay. _ Shh... Gypsy? Who's there? Gypsy! Gypsy? Gypsy, let... let me in. Can... can you let me in, please? Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Um... Okay. Oh, oh. Sorry. - Ow, ow. - Oh! Ow! Ow, ow. Sorry. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's all right, it's all right. Um, which one is your room? That one. Oh, I covered it up so you don't have to worry about it anymore. Um, I started packing. I'm so excited that you're taking me on an adventure! Well, you are my princess, right? And you're my prince. That's why you came to save me, right? Yep. I knew you would. Oh. Um... Um... Okay. D-did you... Basically. Welcome to the rest of your life. Hi, um, I'd like to call a taxi, please. It's a street called West Volunteer Way. Do you know where that is? It's a pink house. Yes. Mm-hmm. Okay, and how long do you think that'll be? Okay. Great. Thank you. Good babies. Go on, you two. Be free. Are you sure you still wanna do this, babe? Hon? I'm ready to go. _ _ _ _ _
