 What are you doing here? Well? Speak up. We saw the door was open, so we just came in. And then we heard noises. Yeah, and... and libraries are the most haunted places. Next to attics and deserted highways, so... There's no spooks here. But you still can't wander around deserted areas. Go on, back to your house. Ah, bags.

 Go. Instigate a bag and locker search of the entire school. We must find that missing book. Victor, we are the first people. To set foot in this library for years. Whoever took that book took it a long time ago. That book is our one hope for the elixir, And I will not give it up. Oh, I'm so proud of you. Come to papa. Alfie, there won't be any left at this rate. They were talking about the elixir, Fabian. Victor obviously hasn't hung up his evil boots yet. But you heard what sweety said.

 They don't have the recipe, and the cup was destroyed. Yeah, about the cup. What is that amazing smell? Give that a mix. Something smells nice. Yeah, I'm, uh, helping Trudy cook supper. After last time? No one's forgotten your marshmallow meat surprise. Delicious. Alfie! Oh, turn it off. Oh, in the... Sarah would know what to do. I wish I could make myself dream of her again. I tried to make myself dream about Justin bieber once, I put that down to a brain typo. Amber, what are you talking about? Why? What are you talking about? Dreams. Me too. I'll lend you this book I have. It's really good. Oh, uh... And then next, count your breaths, And with each breath, Imagine yourself walking down a staircase, One step at a time. And then the beaver... I mean, bieber... Is waiting for you at the bottom. Here we go, Amber, The first gift of many. Oh, you shouldn't have. How many, exactly? It's 10:00. Got to go. You'll have time... Cupcakes, yummy! And then I want to hear a pin... Drop. Sorry, sorry. Just doing the rounds up there, you know. Okay, carry on. Five, four, three, Two, one. Hello? Sarah? Are you there? I need your help. Sarah? Dry your eyes, chosen one. I still need you, Sarah. It won't fit in the... Amber, your face. What? Where's the intruder? Ah! So, Amber, talk me through the new 'do. Alfie Lewis, look at my face. Beautiful as ever, um... Oh! It's not that bad. Is it that bad? Amber, you look like a balloon animal. I knew it. Amber, you know I love you for your inner beauty, And no matter what deforming illness you may have, I'll always... It's you, you doofus! I'm allergic to raspberries, And you made me raspberry-flavored cupcakes. Oh. Yes, perfect timing. Tell me the truth. Hair? Or no hair? - Hair. - Definitely hair. There we go. This will cheer you up, Amber. - What is it? - Flowers. Ah! Ow, ow, ow, ow! It's a cactus. You got me a cactus. Gift fail, Alfie. What happened to orchids? - Oh, cacti were two-for-one. Well, where's the other one? Oh, good. You found it. Look at you. No more gifts, Alfie. When I said you shouldn't have, You really shouldn't have. I said six. That's all they had in the shop. Why do you need so many? To make friends and influence people. This stuff is like currency on the inside. This isn't Alcatraz. Oh, and I want half your allowance. Unless you want me to blow the whistle. Okay. Okay. Pleasure doing business with you, Clarke. Of course, you must stay. Oh, you are so kind. Thank you, I... Gran! Oh, hi, darling. Oh, miss me already? Is everything okay? Yeah, of course. Are... are you okay? What's with all the luggage? Just my luck to pick a hotel that floods. And everywhere else is full, So I thought your gran could stay in your room tonight, If that's all right. You know, I'm kind of glad your hotel flooded. So am I. Come. Oh, okay. Here's one of me with a really big buttress. Oh, now, don't put yourself down. See you guys later. You do realize you're going to spend the entire film. Explaining the plot to him. Shut up, Clarke. Uh, are you sure you can't come? Look at these gargoyles, Fabian. Nina Martin, Fabian Rutter. Oh... Ooh, was that him? The Victor? Why didn't you tell me he was cute? I think he is. Thunk! I know it's not as good as a movie and popcorn, but... Look, it's perfect. If it wasn't for this attic, We might have never even got together. I guess, when you put it that way. Did I forget to floss? I'm going to have to move it if it keeps doing that. That's another reason why I brought you here. I wanted to show you this. The cup. I thought it had been destroyed. It's indestructible. I wish they made friends like that. Amber. I broke two over the summer. One of them fell in the pool, And the other one got run over by the limo. Is that the cup? Is it Sibuna? Is it starting again? No, and why did you follow me up here? It's supposed to be a date. Oh, sweet. Weird, but sweet. Okay, we're good. Maybe we should just go. We don't want Victor to catch us up here again. Three's a crowd. I get it. My bad. I'll be out in a minute. Amber? Oh! Sorry. I-I thought you were Amber. Alfie... what? I was trying to apologize. For yesterday? With a skeleton? Too much? A little bit. Hmm. This was pushed under the door for you, Victor. Hand-delivered. Oh? Have you thought any more about what I said? About turning the attic into a spare bedroom? It'd be really useful. You know, when friends and relatives come to stay, Like Nina's gran. Yes, yes, yes. Whatever. Just... Really? So I'll start clearing it out? Yes, whatever. Please go. There is hope yet, corbiere. What's this? You may as well give me actual peanuts. Take it or leave it. We agreed. Half your allowance. No, you agreed. I did not. Hardball it is, then. Prepare to lose. I refuse to be blackmailed by you anymore. Do your worst. Fighting talk. You've got sass, Clarke. I like that. See you later, loser. Oh, Victor. Oh. The commission for ancient treasures and artifacts. The man in charge is a friend of yours, is he not? Gustav ziestack is more of an old colleague. Why do you ask? "secure the exhibition. Find the book of isis." An anonymous note? - Your friend... - Gustav. Gustav is looking for a venue. To host the treasures of Egypt exhibition. Call him and convince him to host it here. What? "secure the exhibition. Find the book of isis." Victor, I want nothing more to do with this. Call him. I want that book. Dude, I'm flunking these Amber gifts. I need to get something that's romantic but not lethal. What, uh... is that a photo? What photo? Well, the one you're holding and I'm pointing at. This is a picture of my girlfriend. - Girlfriend. - You had a girlfriend? Yeah, I... She dumped me like a shoe. I can't stand the sight of her. What are you doing? Clearing this place out. - What? - You said I could. Guest bedroom. Oh. Don't touch anything this side of the room. I'll take that down to the cellar later. Anything that side can go. Ah, no. Apart from that... That's just a bit of broken doll. Okay. Shame you couldn't come last night. The movie was amazing. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, we had a great time looking at gran's photos. Didn't we, Fabian? Yeah, yeah. No, who doesn't love looking at someone else's holiday? Just wait till she starts reading you her poems. - Really? - Yeah. Is that Jerome? Oh. He makes a real pretty lady. And I have plenty more where that came from. Here we have my brother, Jerome, Sitting on his potty, age two. Jerome crying on Santa's knee, age 11. My brother... - Poppy! - Oh, hi, gerbil. Do you remember the time you dressed up as a girl? They made me do it. They made me do it. It was a school play. It's a kind of Christmas tradition over here, Nina. Hey, no need to justify yourself to me. You never told us you had a kid sister. That's because I refuse to acknowledge she exists. Take it down now. No chance. Get off. - Bag. - Give it back. Do the crime, you pay the fine. Jerome, why do you have to be so mean? And tall? What is going on out here? Haven't any of you got classes to go to? Ah, who is responsible for this? I am. Well, Clarke, take it down immediately. We're expecting a very important visitor this afternoon. I'll say thanks if you give me back my phone. Later. Loser. And it's definitely better today. - Of course. - Yes, Amber. How many more times? Trudy's clearing out the attic. What? I just saw her junking the old Dollhouse you liked, Amber. No! I was going to ask for that. What about the cup? It should be safe, shouldn't it? I hope so. I'll check on it tonight. Yeah. Hey! Hey, stop! You've got my Dollhouse. He's got a sister. Poppy? Yeah, she started this term. Why is Jerome always so secretive about everything? I know. I mean, who keeps a sister a secret? Weird. Not as weird as Jerome in the dress. I can't believe it. I mean, I tell him everything, Even some stuff I definitely should've held back, Like a fear of red doors and olives. And here we have the drama studio. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon, Mr. Sweet. And has Mr. Sweet filled you in. On the history of the anubis estate, Gustav? It really is quite, quite fascinating. - The frobisher-smythes once owned it, didn't they? That's right. And moving on. Thank you. What was that? I don't know, but did you guys see Victor? He was practically bowing. "quite, quite fascinating, Gustav." "Gustav, would you like to see my pin collection?" "Gustav, I'd like you to meet my raven." "it's 10:00. I want you hear a pin drop." "to Amber, I know you said no more gifts, "but I thought you might like this one. Alfie." Do you like it? I love it. Do I pass the first test? - Only if you make me mocco-chocolata-ccino. With sprinkles. First test passed. Yes. The cup. Okay. It's still here. How long I have waited, Like isis waited for osiris. You have freed me, chosen one. Who are you? What do you want? The day will come when everyone will know my name. Find it, bring it, And you shall weep tears of gold. Find what? The mask of anubis, child. Find it before anyone else... Or forfeit your life.
