Kicked I loud enough? Yes. What? Yes. You are definitely enough. You were just... Yes? I'm sorry. I'm not the one who waits outside a dancer's locker room. I just thought that there was something between us, so I had to... take the chance. My recent film optrćden hćldte probably too little gasoline on your bonfire? - Your recent? - My video. It laid FileShare down. - It's... - Oh, good. - Well, you took courage to you. - Now what? - Now you invite me in town. - Are you with me in town? Please. Be specific.

Devils had hard by scoring today... but I did not. - It's not fun to lose. - It was just a fight. I was not talking about the game. - You are far behind Jelena. - I know. - No outside L.A. Know who you are. - I do too. Jelena is Jelena. She is known and in talk shows. She flashes her perfect eyes. You have something Jelena does not have. - My first name is the same front and rear? - You're Pete Davenport's daughter. If it became known that would all see you at the game. I'm a dancer, not a story. I want to win on my talent. Talent can only get you so far. It mattered to me, and it applied to Jelena. There's a whole world out there out of Devil-girls and fight. You could NL on... And believe me, I do not say to anyone. Thanks, but no thanks. My private life is private. That's the way I am. - You look terrible. - It's my loser face. It's hard and ugly. Our winning streak is over. Oscar is not happy with me. It's just a shame. What's the worst he can do? How bad can it get? You're his fřrstemand on the field. Maybe you have an idea... I did not do well, when I got the job. I need to Oscars nonsense not destroy it. That's his business. This is my. I have another case with you. - Yes? - I want to talk. About Us. What are we doing? I do not know where I stand. What are you thinking? What you feel? - I know what I want to feel. - Sloane... We've done this a couple of weeks, and it's great. Better than great. But I think we BRR define our relationship... - Jesse? - How did you know? There was no magic. I'll do anything to get him out of my life forever. Jesse said that if I go to bed with him, he will stay away. I went along with it. Why in the world would you do that? - Where's your dignity? - I do it for my son. I'm not like you. I can not go to war as you can, so... You do what you gotta. Mother? Mother? Mother? Oh, my God. Ahsha! Wait Ahsha! You did not come to The Grove or match. - Ahsha! - Pete Davenport? He was not good enough, that I needed to know anything about him. You do not care about me. It's in both. I think only on yourself. He is your substance, and you're on it. No! What did she say? How are you... This affair... it's over. I'll meet you out front. Ciao. Jelena. You're beautiful as always. I know of your agreement with Raquel. And the only thing you love more than to torment her, is money. I listen. You know who LJ Reynolds is? Yes. He is the next Dennis Rodman, but more kinky and even more worth it. He is writing contracts with Oklahoma for 135 million. No agent... It's a big commission. I know. I can not comment anywhere near him. I know LJ Through Terrence, and he keeps a private party tonight. Really? I might like the friendship and get you a little time with LJ - - if you let Raquel alone. Forever. What is most important to you? Raquel or money? What's the address? - And you swear to leave her alone? - Yes. I could get used to act with you. Come on in and she gave it to you? Did she know how much you earned at stake? I earned nothing. I never played on a fight. If investors 'd put money on a tip- - and put the money in the new arena, it was just good business sense. Farewell to the girl. Now we are rid of her forever- - I want to celebrate. You helped to motivate her gift, so I have one for you. Congratulations, Chase. Is that official? From today you L.A. Devils' new vicedriftsdirektřr. Your first official action. You've obviously seen the final numbers. If it was humiliation, Olivia promised you, she kept her promise. You should be careful with Olivia. She has a target for an eye, just like everyone else here. Lighten up, All-Star. It Takahashi telescope's my baby. I got it last week. Usually, the only at observatories and universities- - but I'm working hard, so I deserve not a little refraction? I just love the detail- - and forstřrrer 1,000 times, so you can really see heavenly bodies. You do not need a telescope to see a heavenly body. Sorry... I was happy for telescopes as a child- - because I dreamed about getting away. My father was a priest, and to grow up in the home... it was horrible. Really? My father was too priest. How hĺndterede you? By overtrćde as many bids as possible. I never told you how to do your job. You're a good coach, and I respect you. Without Terrence winner we championship. - You and I do not discuss Terrence. - Fine. I want to talk about me. I spoke with assistenttrćneren about how we can keep him healthy. Did you? I have to make 6.8 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.7 assists more per game. I will not tell you what to do. You should just know what I'm doing. And Jelena Howard. What does All-Star for you? It's a dream, come true. Be honest now. River and'll tear you guys until the finish line? No, we are like sisters. It is from ĺbningskampen. It was the worst day of my life, and she looks so happy. I'm sick of everything happening to me. And this was your idea. You have a udestĺende with her, but I will be humiliated. I'm gonna have to kill her. Not for you. For Me. If my only chance is that people know who my father is... What do you say? Tell that to anyone. Tell the world. Terrence has not sent me. I know what you want to say, so just do not. Do not worry about me as a boyfriend. Think of me as someone who has been here long. One who knows things. - Sĺsom? - I know about your past. You've had many chances. So many that now is the team's coach. So I have to give Terrence another chance? Although his tests showed a banned substance? I understand mistćnksomheden. Believe me. Although I never 've seen him do it... you're thinking still his. But I choose to believe him. I'll give him that chance. The BRR you too. You should hear it from me. Terrence is not sitting on the bench more. You have shown initiative and responsibility. It suits you. - There he is. - Coach Davenport! - What can you tell about Ahsha Hayes? - How did you hear about your daughter? There are a lot of journalists out there. - They know about Ahsha. - Is it true? - I hĺndterer them. - I must warn Sloane. - How did it come up? - Good question. I wonder how. Maybe they are just good journalists. Maybe you got someone to say it. Or maybe... just maybe... so Ahsha All-Star dream fade and was so sick of your ass kicked- - she chose her best weapon. It looks like you're out for a row. Ask Ahsha the lift Having strřmafbrydelsen Your telescope is enough large. Is it big? Yes. - Large and heavy? - It is big and powerful. - Can you do the reverse split? - I did not fight. - From your video. - I thought you knew about it. Yes... I lied. I know much about you.

That you were bad. And not believe in the good way. - You spoke with trćneren. - It's not castrating? No, you fought for me. And whatever you said worked. For I am the bench. You think well on, I did not? Otherwise I was not gone to Pete. I know that you have hard by trust people. You will not regret it. - L. J! - You're Jesse. Are you here to suck up to me? - Start. - It sounds as if I have 30 sec. Now you have 26 You should hire me, because I'm the best. How much time do I have left? Everyone says that they are the best. I have to use an agent who'll do anything. Do you? Your reputation is not for fun. Then you know that I mean it. Would I be... řverst or bottom? Do I look like someone who is at the bottom? How far are you willing to go for 4% of a contract on 135 million? - Hello? - I'm calling from Sports Illustrated. I wanted to ask you Pete Davenport and your daughter Ahsha. Ahsha... There goes trćnerens daughter. - Do you know? - Everyone knows it. It makes sense now. Why do you always 've been so stressed out. They say that you found out about it, after you were on the team. I have not spoken out loud about him here. I do not know if I can right now. What I said the other day... My little "Pick-me" speech... - I'll take it with me. - Do you? Yes, Emotions went out loud because of Terrence. Do not worry about me. You have too much between your hands. Take care of yourself. I had strćkke headphones. Reporters rang constantly. I let Olivia say it, so I could beat Jelena vote. Are you exploiting Pete, when you do not even will give him a chance? Just nřjagtigt. The Ahsha, I know would never do it. What else have you done? What do you mean? What happened in the elevator Having strřmafbrydelsen? Flood tide went, I was not trying to get stuck with Derek. Did you kiss him? No... I did not. He kissed me. I knew it. I so badly wanted to be wrong. But I knew it. I can not. - You, me... - Are you breaking up with me? - It's not who you think. - Maybe not. But how long should I wait until it is? A week? A month? Half a year? I can see where this is headed, even if you can not. Or will not. The world sucks you in, and Derek is only part of it. It's exciting and loud, and I'm not there. You're falling faster and faster, and you're trying to stick with me. I know that you do. But over time... you will let go. - German! I know you love me. And I love you. But this happens Ahsha. If I should have anything back... no pride at all... I'm gonna have to leave you... before you leave me. - You would fight. Where is Ahsha? She's not here. - Are you all right? - No, we broke up. What? Why? Where is she? Reporters are calling about her father. They know it. I have to warn her. She knows it. She gave her boss allowed to lćkke it. Olivia? Did Olivia this? Smile! What the hell? - What is this? - Insurance. You drop all sagsanlćg now and I'm trying to keep it to myself. - You'll get it back. - Keep it. I emailed it to myself. It is in the cloud now. I'm sorry. You hire not a guy who can not control his woman. All the times you've taken your ass me. Finally I got you. And you do not have to come later. Tonight is canceled. You do not know how much you will regret it. - Miss Hart, it was delivered to you. - Thank you. We're not finished. I'm coming for you. He was so angry, it was a little scary. - It belong to. - I can not believe it's over. I do not know what to say. That's not true. I know. Thank you gave me my son back. I would hit Jesse. I've never liked him. Can I buy you a drink? Or a house? I can not. I need something. A deal is a deal. You did your, and now I'll do mine. Terrence Wall remains Devil, and you'll get what you want most. I want very much. But it rćkker. Thank you for your help. Sloane? - What are you doing here? - You have not changed. You're still the same toxic opportunistic snake. - I had Ahshas permission. - Do not say her name. Our injury happened a long time ago. It can help her now. - Why not use it? - It's about you, not her. Sloane... She becomes a star, Whether you like it or not. Look me in the eye. Never give your bad advice to my daughter again. Where is Ahsha? All the girls went to several hours ago. Pete? They have found a Devil-girl in water the Vincent Thomas Bridge. In sćsonens last paragraph... Devils grieve over one of its own. A shining star with so much potential- - taken from us far too early. We feel with all her dear. You hit me harder, than anyone has done. - I'm not stupid. - I have a grip on Olivia. That's my wife you're talking about.
