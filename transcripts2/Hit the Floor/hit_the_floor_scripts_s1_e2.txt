 You were an original Devil Girl. Coolest first job ever. - Babe? You're doing it? - I don't know. You think you can come in here and take one of our spots? It's only so long before even you realise that you don't have what it takes. Did you think I was joking when I said I was lucky to get out of there? That is a wild world, Ahsha! You have the talent to be the next Jelena. That makes you a target. - Mia's gone? When? - Last night. We have an addition to our judges table for the finals, former Devil and brand-new Devil's head coach, Pete Davenport. Didn't I hear your coach say something

 about no messing around between Devils and Devil Girls? - Technically, you're not a Devil Girl. - I don't think my boyfriend cares about your technicalities. How can she get away with sleeping with the players and no one else can? Different rules for different folk. - You're suing me? - He needs a man in his life. - Full time. - So find me one! - Sloane. - Olivia. I'm kind of surprised that you wanted her - to do this. - This is all her. - Ahsha, don't be late. - Oh, my God! I'm sorry, Raquel. You asked me to make a choice. That was not the choice I made. - Ahsha was too good. - So was Mia.

 What did I tell you about calling me? The point of you getting gone was staying gone. - Listen. Be careful. - I will. The girls are not my responsibility. Wrong. Ahsha is your responsibility. She's your daughter. Am I packing too much for today? You might want to pack a box of tissues. I've seen plenty of girls chewed up and spit out by Devil Girls Boot Camp. Poof. Gone. I'm not saying I want that. You don't have to worry about me. I am your mother. I would roll you up in bubble wrap and lock you in the basement if I could. It's a good thing we don't have a basement. - Okay! - Hey! Aren't you forgetting something? - I meant this. - Hey. - Okay! - Don't forget to point your toes. - No one likes dead feet. - Bye! Bye. Got my bubble wrap, right here. - I waited till she was gone. - You came to my house? That's what happens when you don't return my phone calls. You shouldn't have come. You shouldn't have dropped that bomb on me and then gone AWOL. - I did not go AWOL. - What do you call it, then, Sloane? Okay, you're right. That whole thing was just... Look, I didn't go to the arena to tell you, but you wouldn't do the one thing I asked, Pete. You wouldn't help me. - What, I... - No. I know it wasn't fair and I'm sorry. So let's just forget it ever happened. - Forget it? - Yeah. You've got your life. We've got ours. Nothing has to change. She's fine. We're fine. I'm not fine, Sloane. We have a daughter. I have a daughter. - How could you not have told me? - You know why. I'm late for work. Welcome to the Devil Girls. You thought tryouts were brutal, you haven't seen anything yet. There are 41 home games per season, not including the playoffs and the Devils always make the playoffs. Add the dancing you'll be doing at public appearances, charity events, etcetera, and by the end of the season, you will hurt, a lot. Devil Girls aren't just artists, we are athletes. We are also ambassadors, representing the organization 24/7. That means no hooking up with any of the players. Or anyone in the front row. Any behaviour TMZ or TMZ-adjacent and you're out. Opening game is in two days. Your first performance, however, is in one. The invitation-only pre-season kick-off party. Investors, politicians, celebrities, they all come here to the Devil's Playground. - What's the Devil's Playground? - The private club upstairs. You have to know Jesus or Oprah to get on the guest list. Now, they're all coming to see the new players and to see you. You need to be perfect. You will be perfect. From the top. We've got such an awesome group this season. They need work. - Are you still upset with me? - What gave it away? So Ahsha's on the team. So what? We've got 13 other girls. This isn't about Ahsha. This is about you ignoring a simple request. Jelena, sometimes in life, compromise is necessary. Well, I shouldn't have to compromise on my team. Your team? I took shaking my ass in the second row of a half-empty stadium and turned it into a $50 million industry. Which I'm the face of and if you want to keep raking in the cash... I don't need cash, Jelena. I'm married to a Devil. What I need is a Captain who is not gonna push back on everything I do. At some point, you're gonna have to be happy with the team we've got. At some point, I will. We are making so many public appearances. What's that? Did they give that to you? Uh, no. This is my playbook. "Mario Consalvi, Colonial State Street Bank." "$43 million, Sky BOX 113." VIP, line of business, net worth, seat in the arena. What's that doodle? Is that a magic wand? It's a whip. I like to draw the fetishes myself. And what are you gonna do with that? I'm a Devil Girl now. I'll never pay my own rent again. Jelena? I just wanted to say I'm not going to be any trouble to you. I'm just here to dance, that's all. That was me hazing. I'm sorry. Devil Girls have to be tough. But we are all Devil Girls now. We're cool. If you're cool with me? Yeah. Of course. Out with the old, in with the new. I thought you'd be tired of dancers by now. No, no, I'm just... You know, I was with them during tryouts. I guess I'm invested. Coach Davenport, I just wanted to say thank you for putting me on the team. I promise I will never be late again. That must have been strange. Seeing Sloane. I saw you talking to her the other day. Oh, it was fine. - I better get off to practice. - Sure. Terrence, Derek, you guys made the playoffs the last two years. So what? Making the playoffs was never good enough for me and it can't be good enough for you two either. Look, I have a lot riding on this season and I know you two have a lot riding on this season too. Whatever we've got going on in our lives, we need to check that at the door. While we're in this arena, we need to be totally focused. I can do that. Can you? Hell, yeah. Absolutely. All right. Oscar is buying you all new uniforms, as you know. All that he asks, all the old ones be turned in. Thank you. Thank you. Tighter is righter. Hey, what do we have to do to get tickets to opening game? Well, it depends on who you're willing to slap and tickle. It's for my boyfriend, so no one. - You have a boyfriend? - What? Tick-took, Care Bear. Boyfriends don't last long in this world. He'll be gone by the All-Star game, mark my words. Why would you say that? Look, I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just, you know, giving you facts. Well, German and I have been together through college and he couldn't be more excited for me. It's like you stepped out of a Judy Blume novel and you are baiting me to worry about you, but it's not gonna work. I am not here to get my wings. Looking good, ladies. You' self-conscious around little ol' me? No, just cold. Well, maybe dancing will warm you up. Maybe. Let's see it. You want to see me dance, I'll dance for you. This guy might be able to get you a ticket to the game. Oh, you need a ticket? For who, your big baller boyfriend? Yes, for my big baller boyfriend. Well, tell him not to worry. I'll look after you. He can watch me on TV. Won't you be too busy gawking at yourself? It's quitting time. I should be getting home to my man now. Excuse me. You ever drive a man crazy just by saying no? I never say no. Here comes Willard the other way, takes it himself. - Crossover, left side. - Pass the ball! I have floor burns in places I didn't even know existed and I think I dislocated my shoulder. Today was perfect. Were any of the players there? - They were around. - Come here. I'm sorry. Gosh, Ahsha, you are so amazing. I mean, when I got scouted, I cracked. Yeah, but you, you're doing this. We're doing this, you and me. We're in this together. I just can't wait to come see you at opening game. We don't actually get tickets to opening game. Well, at least I get to be your date for that kick-off party that you told me about, right? We don't actually get tickets to that, either. Well, at least I have you now. That's not all you have. The little outfit for me, girl? Yeah, babe. Come here! I thought you said you had to turn that in. I did. I found this one in the locker room. Thought you might want to get a little use out of it. Oh, yeah. You are never giving that back. You know that, right? You know that, right? You know that, right? - You're bad! - Come here, girl! Pull in a little tighter on that smile. A little bigger. Good, good. These go up on the Jumbotron. Is there lipstick on my teeth? Okay, girls, group photo. Are we ready? This is gonna be on everything, from programmes and magazines to billboards and bus stops, and attached to every piece of merchandise we sell. Let's make magic. Rookies in the back. It's good to see you, Raquel. - How are you doing? - Fine. I heard things have gotten worse with Jesse. Hey. I'd really like to help. Know where I can find a job? - I might, actually. - I didn't mean literally. The hostess job at the Devil's Playground just opened up. It's a really great gig. I could make a call... Thanks, but I can figure this out on my own. I know you can. Well, the manager's there now, if you just happen to be walking that way. You need to take that one down. Do you see that stray hair? So many new comments. Do people think I just sit around reading all of these? How do you delete this? I've sat through enough of my wife's jerk-off charity events to recognise what bored stupid looks like. I'm not bored, Oscar, I'm just distracted. What could be bigger than tonight? Tomorrow's game day. It's the first day of my professional coaching career. Your job starts tonight. This party is packed with investors, politicians and what our Vice-President of Public Relations informs me are celebrities. Look, everybody's gonna want a piece of you, okay? Lots of handshakes, big smiles and you're peeing with excitement about the new season. Don't sweat it, Oscar. I know the drill. - I'm ready. - You better be. Welcome to the Devil's Playground. Ladies, gentlemen, are you ready for this season's Devil Girls? Let's show them how we do it, girls. Baby. That dance was... If it isn't page 13 in my binder. Teddy Reynolds. His daddy owns a movie studio. His granddaddy pretty much invented color TV. He, on the other hand, hasn't done anything with his life... yet. Terrence. Terrence, over here, buddy. - Terrence. - Big fan, huh? Oh, no. We go way back. I just wanted to get a picture of us for my Twitter. He can retweet it to his followers and I can retweet his retweet to my followers, and we can kind of hashtag it back and forth and our fans can subscribe to it, and we can "like" it and check into it on Tumblr, MySpace... Did you hit the medicine cabinet on your way here? Can you get me close for a picture? Sweetheart, you can get a picture of Terrence Wall anywhere. How would you like a once-in-a-lifetime Devils experience you'll be telling your grandbabies about? I am intrigued. Follow me. Hi. Sure. - Raquel! - Ahsha! Wow! Look at you! Look at you! What are you doing here? I'm working here, for now. I'm the new hostess. So that means I get to see you all the time? That's amazing. Here we go again. I can't. He's literally walking in with bitches and hoes. Not tonight. Oh, God. That guy is so mean to you. What did you do to him? When I caught him cheating on me, I went a little Carrie Underwood on his Lamborghini Murcielago. That doesn't seem like you at all. Yeah, well, I was nine months pregnant. I was a little emotional. I'll be over... Yeah. My cocktail waitress fantasy come true. In your fantasy does your cocktail waitress want to choke you until you pass out? Yeah, she could. Unfortunately, for the both of us, I'm not a waitress. I'm the hostess. So you're not a whore. You're the madam. Don't get me wrong, anything that keeps you off the pole, I'm all for. Still, it's not really a place you can take a four year old to, is it? Good thing I was able to step in and help out when I did. Help? Is that what you call taking a little boy away from his mother? Jesse, you may be a big-time agent, but you are a small, small man. My client Derek needs bottle service. Why don't you dance it over to him, eh? Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm having sex inside Terrence Wall's locker! Inside Terrence Wall's locker. Less narrating and more gyrating, honey. I'm close and so is security. Derek. Those your sisters? Girls are like Jordans, you can never have too many. - Whoa. Hey. - Hey, Coach. Just gonna walk by and not give me hug? It looks like you've got your hands full already. I saw her first, Coach. - Hello? - We need to talk. - Pete, I said... - Yeah, I know what you said. - Okay. I'm coming over. - You are not coming over. - Sloane, I am on the edge here. - Call me tomorrow. No, you're not listening to me. I need to see you now, right now. Or would you rather I go back inside this kick-off party and have a couple drinks, get real chatty? Because I could do that. - That's not funny. - I am dead serious. I'll come there. - Thank you. - Ahsha, you were so great up there. - You could see me in the back? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. - I started off in the back too. - Was my mom in the back? Your mom? No. No, your mom was always right up in the front. You have so much of her in your eyes and the way you move, it's... - You were friends. - She told you that? No, just guessed. Best friends. - Raquel. - Jelena. I'm glad to see you landed on your feet. Devil Girls have to be tough, right? This was delivered here for you. - To the Playground? - Excuse me. You okay, babe? Of course. I have to go fix my makeup. - I'll be right back. - Okay. I got the plans for the new arena. It's gonna make the Barclays Center look like Little House on the Prairie. The city's never gonna let you into Hollywood. - It's too congested as it is. - You let me worry about that. Hey, hey, hey, great to see you. Bret Locke“, the best safety 'm the NFL. - You taking off? - Yeah, man. As soon as Jelena gets back. You might want to head out too, brother. - The party just started. - Come on, D. You partied enough last season, don't you think? - You the coach? - No, I'm not. Just a man that wants a ring and I would have got one last season but my team mate ran out of gas in the playoffs. Do you want to compare stats? It's not about stats. It's about championships. Maybe you want one of those. I do kick box cardio at the gym, but this guy was a big guy. Barn, he goes down like a sack of spuds. - How's everyone doing? - Hey! This is the one I was telling you about. Don't you want to know what I told them? I have a lot of people I have to take care of tonight. That's what I told them! - What the hell? - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God, I'm... - Jesus. - What, are you insane? - I'm so sorry. Jeez, this is a new suit! That's very funny, isn't it? Where are all your lady friends? Did they get called into surgery? Okay, so I kind of don't know what to do here. Usually, you hit on me, I spray you with a water bottle and then I walk away. Are you (Wing? It's Terrence. He's riding me. You know, Jelena was riding me, but we're cool now. It'll pass. You think so? Well, if you'd stop acting like an ass. All right. You know... Call this dude. He'll hook you up with a ticket. A ticket to opening game? You don't have one, right? You know this is for my boyfriend, right? Look, don't tell anybody. Got an image to protect. - You couldn't come inside? - No, I couldn't come inside. - Have you lost your mind? - I can't stand this. My players are hitting on her. People think I'm a creep because I'm staring at her. She talked to me today, Sloane. - I have to tell her. - Okay. Okay. - Here's why you can't say anything. - Sloane... No, Pete, hear me out. Ahsha does not know this world, not like you and I do. It's not easy. You know what I mean. Now, if she finds out about this, it'll tear her away from me just when she needs me the most. It'll spin her out and this is not the world she should be spinning out in. So what am I supposed to do? Just pretend she doesn't exist? Like she's just some other girl running around the arena? No. Not forever. Just, let her get her legs here, okay? - And then we'll figure it out. - Sloane- Not now. Pete, you owe me. Okay. We'll do it your way. I won't tell Ahsha that I'm her father, for now. Thank you. Four hours, I'm gonna be dancing inside of Devils Arena in front of 20,000 people! Don't forget all the people watching on TV. 'Cause you know I can't wait to be screaming, that's my girl! Get up! Work, work, work! Baby, give me a sign when you out there, a little something special for me. I could wiggle my ear. Or I could tap my wrist. - Nice. - Or I could pull on my... Where's my badge? I can't get in without it. My badge. I left it right here. Can you go check my bedroom? Yeah, of course, babe. Are you kidding me? A courtside seat, baby? You got me a courtside seat? Where? How? I got the hook-up, baby. Do you need to do your makeup or can we go? Of course not! You are gonna be beautiful. Go, go, go! Yes! Do you! - You excited? - Yes! Yes I am! I'm really excited. - Who's that? - That's Kyle. - She's on the team. - She almost hit us, man. - When did you get a new car? - Teddy Reynolds bought it for me. Nothing like getting fondled by the nacho cheese-covered fingers of America. I saw Raquel at the Devils Playground. Yeah, she's working there now. I can't help but think she got an assist in making her way back into Devils Arena. So what? So that's something you could have run by me, don't you think? That's it. I've had enough. Who goes, who stays, who comes back. How you've got something to say about everything and I've been listening to it for way too long. - Oh, have you? - I have. You need to understand something, Jelena. I'm the boss around here, not you. Director, Captain. Any confusion about that is my fault, but that is so over. Sadly, the same can't be said for this speech. Things are gonna change around here. There are gonna be things that happen that you might not like and you're just gonna have to deal with them. Things? Such as? Ahsha will be dancing in the front tonight. That's not how we do things. There's no "we" anymore. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Devils Arena opening day, where your Los Angeles Devils take on Indiana. Devil, Devil, Devil, Devil Girls! - Line up. - Let's do this. Your first game as coach. Don't piss yourself. - All right, girls, ready? - Ahsha! - Watch out, man. Ahsha, baby. - Babe. Baby, I just wanted to give you something for luck. Babe, you need to get out there before someone steals that courtside seat. - Okay, okay, good luck. - Love you. Bye, bye! I don't know how you're holding yourself together right now. Jelena Howard cannot be nervous. Not for me, for you. It's one thing to perform in front of this crowd, but to perform in front of your daddy too? My What? Pete Davenport, your father. Your mom danced for him back in the day and now it's your turn. - It's almost poetic. - Devil Girls! Let's go. Let's kick ass. Ahsha. Next time on Hit The Floor. - I've been a bad boyfriend. - Very, very bad. - You told her? - She knows? Party at the suite. On me, let's go! - Yahtzee! - Somebody get me a redhead. It's getting real old cleaning up your messes, man. - I will find out what happened. - You should. - That is weird. - What? Mia, I just got an email from her with a telephone number. Ahsha, what are you doing here? The game's on. Is it true? Hi.
