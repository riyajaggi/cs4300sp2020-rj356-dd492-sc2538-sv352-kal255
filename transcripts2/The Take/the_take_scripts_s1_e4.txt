 Go on, Freddie! What people don't know is that the Second World War corrupted the whole country. After it finished, everybody was on the take. Well, you had to be, didn't you, just to stay alive. - So I get to jump the queue. - Special circumstances. I'll be outside. Me and Siddy, we used to work the docks together. We was, what, ten, eleven years old? We'd go down there on the rob. The whole black market must have come down there.

 Thought you might want this. Right from the start, I could see that Siddy was good at it. Thievin'. Yeah, and now that bastard's thievin' off you, isn't he? I'm gonna miss you, Freddie. No one tells it like it is quite like you. Shake 'em up. See what falls out. Then I'll get word to you. Bon voyage, my son. - So you finally hit puberty, eh, Jimmy? - Better late then never, eh? Come here! Oi! Ha! Oh, you better have some nice treats for me in this tin wagon.

 Culture Club, yeah? And who the fuck are these poofters? You need to catch up, Fred. Get with the times. The only catching up I'm gonna be doing is all that money I missed out on inside. - He'll be here soon, Mags. - Don't worry, I know. I'm not even bloody dressed yet. He's probablyjust round the corner. - Probably ain't gonna turn up. - Mum! So I here you're with Siddy now, yeah? Just some car stuff. Nothing special. Don't you worry. I'll be taking care of things from now on. It's just like old times, innit? You dressed up like a turkey and him pissed and off with a bit of strange. Why don't you go and help with the food, Mum? We've got a lot to do. All right. Come on, let's leave your mum to dress up pretty. Things are gonna be different, Maggie. Freddie's different now. He's got plans for us. Jackie said Ozzy's been looking out for your boy on the inside. - Grooming him for better things. - Yeah. Well... Don't mean sod-all out here. Oh, my God! He's here! Oh my God! I'm telling you, that's him. Quick! God... He's here! Freddie's here! Freddie! - Freddie! - Oi, oi! Oh, my God! Oh! I missed you! Oh! I missed you so much! I so missed you. You look excited, what's going on? I think things are gonna change for us. Why's that? Hey, mate. Oi! I'm cuttin' in, yeah? Come over here. Ha-ha! You've grown, ain't ya? Eh? - Hey! - Got all the lumps in the right places! Seems no different to me. Let him enjoy himself tonight, Fred, he's just come home. Mmm. Let's go and shag you back into shape, yeah? Oh!

It's like the second time! - Hello, Siddy. - All right? Long time no see. Oh, God! Don't bloody slow down! Come on! - Ohh...! - Hold it! This house looks like shit, babe. I wanna get you some new furniture. We're gonna move ain't we, you said? A proper house with a garden. Mm. Let's just hope it's a boy next time, eh? Mm? Piss off, we're busy! Siddy Clancy's here. He's out here waiting for you. Yeah, nice one! Jesus wept! All right, Siddy mate, how's it hangin'? Shall we step outside? Onto the balcony. Why don't you sit down? You must be tired after your long stretch. Help him take the weight off, boys. There. That's better, isn't it? Ozzy tells me he's got big plans for you, thinks you're very capable. But here's my problem, Freddie. I run things out here. In the real world, on the outside. And until you earn my respect, you are just gonna have to wait in line along with everyone else. If that's all right. Yeah. Yeah. You're a good boy. All right, boys, I think we've finished. Thanks for the champagne, Freddie! It was very thoughtful of ya. Pink's definitely your colour! I thought he was gonna chuck you off that wall. Yeah? Then why didn't you fuckin' do something? Eh? You got a lot to fuckin' learn, Jimmy. You got a lot to learn. What did that bastard do to you, eh? It's all right, it's nothing that we can't sort out. Come on. Jesus. All this time I was inside, Jimmy, how did people treat you? - What do you mean? - People like Siddy, how'd they treat you? All right, I guess. - Nothing special. - Yeah. Nothing special. Well, you are special, Jimmy. We both are. Get out the motor. Who lives here? Er, Mickey Daltry. My old partner. He's gone up in the world, hasn't he? Look, I know you're sore about what happened but...but he's with Siddy now. What's the matter with you, Jimmy? Just popped round for a cup of tea, mate. - Mrs Daltry? - Yes? These are for you. - Oh! Thank you! - We're old friends of Mickey's. It's lovely to finally meet you. He told me he was getting married again but I've been abroad, see? Malta. Oh! Please, come in. Well, I'm Freddie, this is my cousin Jimmy. Er, Mickey's just doing the lawn, I'll give him a shout. Sorry, boys. Do you mind? Your shoes, we just had this laid. Make yourself at home, boys. Ooh, take a look at the fuckin' gaff. What is that madwoman doing? - Aerobics. - You what? It's all the rage. Keep fit. - Here they are, back from Malta. - All right, Mickey! How's things? Good to see you, Freddie. Why don't you go and make us all a cup of tea? Do you want some biscuits, boys? Got some Garibaldi in. Smashin'! Oh, I bet she keeps you fit, Mickey, she's built like a bazooka. Well, I heard you were out. How you doin'? Strange thing, Mickey. I done four years inside, you never once come see me. Yeah. Sorry, Freddie. I really meant to. Mm. You see, I thought you'd at least come once, you know? Just to explain why you didn't turn up that day. Do you remember that day? I was on the way there, I swear. By the time I got there, the filth were all over you. Yeah, then you ran away. I heard that. Also heard, yeah, that the rozzers only discovered half of our dough. Strange, innit? I hear you're with Siddy now. Yeah, that's right. We're close. Right... Right, well… The way I see it is, seeing as we're all going to be working together again, soon, that we put all of that shit behind us, right? Yeah? Start again. Yeah? Come 'ere, big boy! I missed you, come on. - It's so good to see you. - Ohh, you done well on my money! What? I said you done well on my fuckin' money! Fred, you can't do that! You didn't give a single penny of all of this, yeah, to my kids. You didn't give a single penny of this to my missus! Mickey! Baby, talk to me! - You bloody animal! - Well, he always wanted to be on TV. You've gotta face the truth, Jacks. Mum, she really doesn't need this, OK? No! Cos what she bloody needs is to get her head out the sand and face reality. Look at this place! Go on, then, Mum. Spit it out. I'm sorry, love, but he is shagging around again. - No. - That's why you ain't seen him. - It's not true. - How long has it been? One week? Two weeks, since he was last here? - Look, it's none of your bloody business! - Yeah, it is my business. You have got to start looking after them girls proper, not running around after him like some bloody lovesick teenager. You're just jealous of what me and Freddie have. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - How do you reckon that, then? - Because you never had it with Dad! You bloody stupid little mare! You got no idea! Why do you think I know what's going on here? Look, he's not shagging around, all right?! All right, babe. You keep believing in him! What good did that do? Jackie! What are all these? Dexedrine? They keep me happy. How long you been taking 'em? It hasn't been easy, sis, with him inside. There's been some long nights to get through. Mum's wrong, you know. It is gonna work this time round. - I'm gonna make it work. - So where is he, Jacks? They mean nothing to him! You know, the other girls... they're just slags! You have to stop this with the pills. Jackie. Doctor doesn't want to give me any more. Specially now. I'm pregnant. Well...babe, I mean... - Yeah. - That's a good thing. He doesn't even know yet. Listen, right... I'm gonna clean you up. Get you ready for his mum's anniversary do, yeah? Make you look great. And you're gonna be strong tonight, OK? You're not gonna let Freddie see you like this. - OK? - Yeah. Do you remember the time Jimmy ran away? Oh, my God, yes! No, you half-inched the old man's snout so you got a slap. And then he hid down the coal chute for two days. - How did you find him again? - I really... I just can't. - What? - I can't. Go on, how did you find him? - Well... - Go on, go on. No, me and Freddie had just started going out and that's when we used to, you know. What the hell is she doing here? She thought... - Hang on a second. - Just look who he's brought here. - Come on. - I'm coming with you! On their 40th wedding anniversary an' all. Fuckin' heartless ponce. Oh, Freddie. Kitty... - Have you met my son Freddie? - No. But I've heard all about you. Oh, yeah? All good, I hope. You know, you remind me of, um, an actress in a movie that I just watched, actually. Really? Is it Officer And A Gentleman? People say I look like that Debra Winger. Nah. It's called Deep Throat. Now why don't you turn around and do one back to whatever hole it is that my old man keeps you? You can't talk to her like that. - Kitty... Kitty! - Just leave me alone! Nice one. Mum's in the bogs crying her eyes out cos you brought your little slut to the party. You're getting above yourself, son. Everywhere I go, people are talking about it. Oh, yeah? What are they saying? No one gave you permission to do that to Mickey Daltry. He was protected. Oh, fat lot of fucking good that did. If you ever speak to Kitty like that again... - Mm? - ..I'll finish you off meself. Uh-oh. - You all right, babe? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You all right, mate? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's cool. You all right, Mum? Oh, I'll sit there, shall I? - Who's your bird, Teddy? - My name's Patricia. Patricia Reynolds. Yes, Ozzy's sister. Well, I'm pleased to meet you. I'm Freddie. Let's not fuck around. I haven't got the time. Siddy here's been working on a job for the last year. Big job, meant to come off next month. But it seems now you've turned one of his key players, Mickey Daltry, into a vegetable. Yeah, well... Me and Mickey had some unfinished personal business. It got a bit messy. And who was it gave you the nod to do that? Was it Ozzy? No, I, er... I did it off my own back, actually. I will buy him a new TV if you want. This is what's gonna happen, Freddie. You step out of line again, you get no more passes. You understand? What Ozzy wants you to do now is take Mickey's place and join Siddy's crew. From now on, you do exactly what Siddy says. And he gets to decide what your cut is. OK? You're pushing your luck. Yeah, well, that's what I'm good at. Well? What did he say? I'm going on a bank job with Siddy. What? Siddyjust... Siddyjust let you off about Mickey. Nah. At some point, either on the job orjust after it, he's gonna kill me. Now, I wanna ask you a question, and I want you to think seriously before you answer. Cos you're the only one that I trust. Oh, Jimmy! Ah! - Oh! - Did you knock that screen down? I don't care! Stuff the screen! Ah! Ah, ah, ah! What's the matter? Tell me. Going on a big job. - Lots of money involved. - What kind ofjob? It's a security depot. - With Siddy's crew. - What? You're doing this cos of Freddie, aren't you? He's got you into this, hasn't he? Why do you let him use you like this? - This is my decision! - Yeah, right. What do you want from me, Mags? Do you want me to be respraying stolen Cortinas all me life? Eh? Is that how we're gonna buy an' 'ouse? Freddie's always looked out for me, whatever you think of him. How dangerous is it? I can handle meself. Eh? Come on, I don't wanna argue. I know. I'm doing it for us. The Cedar. Yeah, hang on. - Freddie? - Yeah? Hello? Did you talk to Siddy and Pat? - Yeah. - So it's all sorted? Yeah. Keep an eye on the gold. Don't make it obvious, just keep a count on what comes back. Hey, look... I wanna take someone with me, yeah? Watch my back. l don'lt trust him, Ozzy. l'lm no good to you in the river, am l? - You got someone in mind? - Yeah, my cousin Jimmy. OK. I'll talk to him. - And Freddie... - Yeah? You attack one of my boys without permission again... and I'll cut your balls off. You wanted me to shake things up. Thank you, Father. Good night, you. Sweet dreams. Daddy? You're not gonna go away again, are you? No, babe. Good night. You know, whenever I hold you... I can't help but get horny these days. Look, you haven't got time, Freddie. I've used softener on this so it shouldn't itch, all right? Do you think it's gonna be a boy? It feels different to the other two. I want it to be a boy. Come here. - Listen, I'm really worried about tonight. - Don't be silly. I know you're doing this for all of us, and for him inside me. But I want you back safe tomorrow. OK? Who's the key man?! Open the safe or we're gonna fuckin' kill ya! Stay close to me, my son. Don't worry, babe. Your Jimmy'll be just fine. He'll stay out of trouble. - Is it always like this? - Oh... Every bloody time. We're gonna make you burn! I can't remember it! - I can't remember it! - Tell us the bloody combination! No! Don't! Don't do that! I can't remember it! Well, it's not gonna bloody help him is it? What the fuck are you talkin' about? Just give me five minutes with him, yeah? This had better work. Here you go, mate. It's all right. OK, so, let's keep going through this slowly, all right? OK. Last Friday you woke up and you had breakfast. What did you have? Rice Krispies. I always have Rice Krispies. And then you drove into work... and what was the weather like? Erm... Oh, cloudy. Cloudy. Cloudy. Right. And who was the first person that you saw when you got into work? Peter. I had a cup of tea with Peter. Th-Then we spoke about...football. Mmm! Oh! I thought the poor sod was gonna have a heart attack! - I thought he was a goner myself. - Exactly. I thought he was gonna keel over. Thank God our Jimmy took him in the bog. And sucked him off! That's not all you had to do, was it, babe? - Oohh! - What did you do, Jimmy? He only remembered the first three numbers after I blew him. Had to work much harder for the last two. No wonder he's onlyjust sat down! Here, Kelly, you got any Nivea? Here, Jimmy, take us through it again, will you? Freddie, come here, mate. Let's get pissed. I want you to enjoy yourself tonight. Have a drink, have a toot. Cos after this, you and your little tit of a cousin are going home with nothing. Rightt... How d'you work that out, then? Do you think I've forgotten what you did to Mickey? I'm keeping back your shares for his family cos let's face it, you've been pulling my fucking dick ever since you come out. So you can forget about the money. You are lucky to be going home tonight. God damn you, Freddie. Course, this was back when me and Ozzy was doing the Bethnal Green run. We was still using the fruities as a front. I'll tell you something about Ozzy, though - here's a man who could never take a piss in a public toilet. Straight up! Oi... - Ozzy says hello. - What? - Come on! - Fuckin' shut it! This muppet's had his day! Right? So let him bleed. Fuck off home, calm down. Your money'll still be here in the morning, all right? First time? No. Why did my Jimmy go, then? Why didn't he go himself? Freddie's got a record, Mum, they're hardly gonna let him in, are they? - You want to get some food inside you, girl. - Not today, Mum, all right? - You want some coffee? - Yeah, please. How do you have it, Jimmy? Black? I always think only poofs have milk in their coffee. - Black's fine. - Good man. Oh! Ohh! Stay the fuck in your seat. Now... Talk to me about this stinking mess you and your cousin have created. Who gave the nod to take out Siddy? Well, someone must have because it sure as hell wasn't me. Freddie had to do it. Siddy was gonna kill him. Really? Hm. Let me fill that up for you. That's why Siddy wanted him on the job, so he could finish him off afterwards. Back in our day, Joseph, you couldn't even look at someone without proper permission. Everything worked out all right... cos we had rules. Snotty little buggers who come after us, they didn't want any of that. And what's happened? All I can say is it's been a long time coming. Siddy was waiting for the right moment. He told everyone, we all heard it. - What right moment? - To take you down. Become the boss. What? Siddy told everyone he was sick and tired of working for you. That's why everybody thinks Freddie was acting for you. That's what they're all saying out there on the street. So if you decided to, um... take care of me and Freddie... - I mean, say we were found... - Headless. In the Thames. Yeah. Well, then everyone would realise what a fuckin' mess this really is. And I don't think that'd be good for business. Freddie's lucky to have someone like you. You're clever. You make a good team. More coffee? Yeah. Hello, babe. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be more than OK. - So... - Sorry. Mum! I'm starvin'! - You all right? - Yeah, great. - Mum! - Better late than never. - That looks great. Thanks. - All right? Smells great. - Just give me some more of that gas. - You're not allowed any more. - Don't give me that, you bloody slag! - Hey, Jackie, come on. I remember you from school. You had no bloody mates then either. Now, you just stop that, Jackie. I'm ever so sorry, love, she's not herself. And you were covered in spots. Now go and get me some fucking gas, spotty! Sod you, Jacksie Strummers! I'm really sorry. - Jackie, you can't say that. - I can, I'm in pain! - It ain't like it's your first, is it? - Oh, you can piss off too! D'you know what? I bloody will! - Mum! - No, you suit yourself. - Come on! Come on, it's all right. - I'm in so much pain. I know, I know. Where is he, Mags? Why isn't he here yet? I don't know. Mum! Mum! Mum? Why didn't you open the door? How come you're not dressed? What about the hospital? He left me. He's set up home with his little trollop. Come on, shh-shh. He's taken everything, even the Flymo. Ohh... Right. Erm... Jimmy, will you, er, take Mum upstairs and, er, help her get dressed, yeah? - Why, where you going? - I'll meet you down the hospital, yeah? - Jack's about to drop. - I know, I know, I know, I know. What do you want? It's a housewarming present. Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot, I didn't realise it was serious between you two. She's made me listen to some of her music, you know. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. There's that new black bird, "Sade". You ever heard of her? Nah. I'm more of a Pink Floyd man myself. Course, she keeps me on me toes upstairs. You know what I mean? Yeah, she's got an arse like an apple, mate. She got good taste an' all. She's makin' our gaff look like something out the magazines. Course, your mum... She never understood any of that stuff. I don't think I could do this. - Babe, you could do anything! - I'm not gonna do it yet. - I want more than just this, all right? - Yeah, I know you do. Nearly there now. Little Freddie. Freedom to party! Jimmy! - All right, mate? - Hello, Des. Come upstairs, boys. Come on! - What's your problem? - That little bitch! Everyone on this estate knows it as well. She's a dirty slut! - Oh, yeah? Look who's talking! - She's got a tart like you for a mother! - How long's this been going on? - Since lunch time, Auntie Mags. - I swear I'll take her walkies off a cliff. - Get away! I just wanna get to bed. I don't feel well. Come on, down here. It's all right, love. Go to bed, she'll be all right. What the hell's got into you, Jackie? Sit up. Freddie. Freddie's got someone else. - Kelly Hutchins? - No! Not that stupid girl. Fuckin' hell. Someone serious, Maggie. Come here. - This is it? - Yeah. - This is what they're doing downstairs? - Yeah. Kids are calling it ecstasy. Des... Is it Des or is it, um... Is it Desmond? - It's Des. - Right. OK, look, what I don't understand, Des... is why the McCoys have sent you to talk to me. Hmm? I mean...why are those two cheeky bastards not here themselves? - I'm running this for 'em. - I'm sorry? Lookie here, mes hombres! Get your gnashers around all this pie and mash! I tell you, we are bloody caning it out there. Des, my rude boy, in the house. Give me some skin. You must be Freddie Jackson. I'll just take this opportunity to say you're a fuckin' legend around here and this is an absolute honour for me. Shane. Shane Mankin? Look, anything you want - snort, Es, bit of the other, you just give me a shout. Mi casa, su casa.  Ha-ha! Sometimes he comes back in the middle of the night. And he wants to... Well, you know. And I have to pretend that I don't know that I'm his second of the night. That I can't still smell her on him. I ain't gonna let that bitch take him, you know? Why do you stay with him, Jackie? He causes you so much pain. I love him, Maggie. I'm nothing without him. Nothing. I've discussed this with the McCoys and the way I figure it... - Yeah? - ..if you guys wanna come in on this, we can open up two separate labs. Split the risk, double the goods. Exactly. One shuts down, move to the other. What do you think, Fred? What I wanna know... is where you're from. - What? - Where did you grow up? London, of course, Freddie. East London. No. No, that's a pork pie, isn't it? Eh? We all know that accent of yours ain't really from around here. What is this? Course it is! What you lookin' at him for? He ain't gonna help you, is he? Come on, where did you really grow up... ..posh boy? Huh? Windsor. Right! What, you got a problem or what? Sorry, Doris, did someone ask you a question? Look, seriously, I think we're getting off the point here, Freddie. No, look. Come on, my point is, right... My point is, why this joker thinks he can earn on my turf without my fuckin' permission! You let him go! Now! Right, you need to tell your weekend warrior to put his fuckin' gun down and calm down. - Cos all we want is your money. - You better reconsider this. Cos from over here, you're both fucked. This is fucked! Poofter! You're not mincing round the bush now, this is fuckin' London. And you are way, way out of your league. Yeah? So what, are you gonna shoot him? - Maybe. - Yeah? Go on, then. - See if I care. - What?! I think you will fuckin' care. Go ahead and shoot this piece of shit... and I'll shoot you. Oh, Mother of God! Please don't let me die, Keith, don't let me die! Please! Fine. Have it your way. Whoa! Ha! Jimmy, you all right? You all right, Jimmy? - Yes! Fine! - I'm dying! Fuck! Fuck! Jesus, Fred. What planet are you on? You think too much, Jimmy, that's your problem. Have you lost the bloody plot? These guys are backed by the McCoys! Oh, sod the McCoys, they're a couple of Mick wankers. We were meant to be doing a deal with them! Jimbo! All I know is, mate, we have got 75 large in the back of the motor. Yeah. And now I'm gonna get me some Oriental pussy. Does this... Does this not register, eh? Ozzy sent us in there to negotiate and you end up robbing it like a two-bit post office fuckin' job! Nobody's perfect. So what am I supposed to tell Ozzy next week? Why don't you just suck him off instead? Well, let's face it, Jimmy, I mean, you see him often enough. With your cosy, cosy chats. You might as well just take it to the next level! Oh, for fuck's sake. Jimmy! Jimmy! I'm sorry, mate, I shouldn't have said that, OK? Oi! Jimmy! Come on, mate, let's go and get some beers, yeah? Go fuck yourself! Oh, hello, Freddie. - I wet my bed. - Oh, come here. Oh! Let's sort you out, yeah? Oh... What have we here? - What you doin'? - Shh! Freddie, get off me! Now, now. That's not very friendly, is it? I just wanna chat, babe. Promise. Oh, Jimmy. He's a lucky boy. Gettin' to marry a beauty like you. - Where is Jimmy? - We had a bit of a falling out actually. Oh... Yeah. He's wound terribly tightly, your boy, he really needs to cut himself some slack. No, he just needs to cut you out of his life. Ha-ha! Oh... Freddie. You're drunk. Go to bed. Tell me, babe... Does Jimmy really... really do it for you? You know... Freddie? Freddie, babe, is that you? - Get off me! - Shh! Freddie? Where are you? Another time, darlin'. Wait, I am so bloody pissed. Where are you, babe? Oh, honey, I missed you. I fuckin' missed you too, come here. That kid he shot was taking ten large off the McCoys every week just so that nobody touches 'em. Now he's back at his mum's. He's so scared he won't even answer the bloody door, let alone organise another party. - I'm sorry. - No, you're not. So you can stop all that bullshit now. This is way past "sorry". He's becoming a liability. Nah, I can control him. He can't fuckin' control himself! How are you gonna manage it? This is about business, Jimmy. - Yeah, I'll give 'em all their money back. - Nah. Freddie gets to keep that. Tell us about the drug. The ecstasy. What do you think? - Well, I think it's gonna be massive. - So do I. I've had a chat with the McCoys, they still want us in on this. They're willing to sweep all this aggro under the carpet. - Apparently your boy... Des? - Yeah. Des likes you. Thinks you're on the level. But they don't want Freddie anywhere near it, now or in the future. And I'm with 'em on this. You want me to run this all by myself? - He'll never swallow that. - Let me worry about that. I'll handle him. No, I don't think I can do that. To Fred. Think about your future. So, what did he say? It's OK. It's OK, I sorted it. You did? Yeah... He wasn't fuckin' happy. But I brought him round. You're a fuckin' diamond, Jimmy boy. Right. Come on. Let's go and get smashed, yeah? You gonna be all right with him? We'll be fine. Won't we, Freddie? Hello, Dad. How are you? Right from the start. Worthless. Worthless! Bloody failure. You've gone mad, haven't you? Freddie? Leave him alone. - Oh, dear. - Come on. Right. Bye. Fuckin' 'ell, how do you get those towels so fluffy? Tell me about that new drug deal Ozzy's doing. - What new drug deal? - With the McCoys. Oh, no. It's not on any more. Not what I heard. What do you mean, not what you heard? Why, what's Ozzy told you? Ozzy said nothing to me. No... Oi, tell me! Oi! Tell me! One of their boys was talking about it at the club. He was drunk. Don't do this to yourself. I can't help it. I just don't want you to keep going through this. He'd hate me. He'd think I did it deliberately, just to fuck him over. It don't matter what Freddie thinks. Really? Not if it gets you both banged up or killed. Let's face it, that's what's gonna happen if you don't take things into your own hands. - But he made me what I am. - Bollocks! No one made you! You're here cos of only one person and that is you. Yeah, Freddie's helped you but you've helped him just as much. Anyway, it doesn't mean you've got to go down in flames with that wanker. Cos that's what he's gonna do to you. Listen to Ozzy. You have to do this. Why are we trying for a kid, Jimmy? What's the point if he's gonna grow up without a dad? It's typical of Maggie to bring us here. Just because her old man's got some taste. You've both dead embarrassing. Taste! You're having a laugh, aren't you? I'd rather be stung by wasps than wear madame's old relics. Oooh! Mum? - Where are we going? - This is the highlight of the night! Where's he taking me? Where are we going? Eh? Right... Get in there, Jimmy my boy! Jimmy, it's the last chance saloon! Oh, sorry. I can't do this. - Come on, mate, it's your stag. - Oh, fuck off, I can't... Come on, girls, let's show him a good time, yeah? I can't do this to Mags! Oh, forget Mags. She's probably on her back right now. What? Don't... Don't fuckin' disrespect her, Fred. I don't mean anything, all I'm saying is that she's probably... knee-deep in cock, mate. Don't you fuckin' talk about her like that, all right? Mmm! Easy, Jimmy. You can't let an opportunity like this pass you by, can you? Yeah, I'm not you. Now get out of me fucking way. - Come on, Jim. - Fuck off! Are you not gonna let me in? Not tonight. Suit yourself. Freddie. It's Jimmy. Jimmy? What Jimmy? Jimmy's running the ecstasy deal for Ozzy. By himself. Freddie? - Yeah? - Have you got the ring? Oh, yeah. Course, yeah. I now pronounce you man and wife. Ozzy gave me this yesterday and told me to read it out to you. So... Here goes. "Dear Maggie and Jimmy. "It's a great shame because I wanted to be there for you "but the bastards seem to think if they let me out I wouldn't come back." "But, as a way of saying how made up I am for you both, "I wanted to give our Maggie a present that really sets her on her way. "So, Maggie dear... "go to 24 The Drive, South Woodford, on Monday morning, "cos that's where your new hair salon is! "Maggie's." - Did you know about this? - Yeah. - Serious? - Yeah.

It's Iike footbaII teams. Football teams? Yeah. lmagine l own West Ham, and you, Freddie, are my manager, right? You run the club, you pick the players, you control who's in, who's out. Right. All right, so I'm... Where does Jimmy fit into all this? Well, Jimmy's been like your right-hand man all these years, hasn't he? Like a first-team coach. And I've decided to promote him. How can you... How can you promote him when I'm the fuckin' manager? Well, that's just it, Freddie. Imagine I don't just own West Ham, I own Arsenal as well. And Jimmy's gonna manage that. All by himself. Jimmy'ls going to take care of all the drugs, Freddie. - How long's he been in here? - About an hour. Just rolled in off the high street. What's he been saying? Jimmy, my boy! Yeah. So, this is where you've been running off to all this time, eh? - How you doing, Fred? - I'm all right actually, thank you. That is a lovely whistle. Did you pick that out for him, Des? Nah... You guys, always really fuckin' sharply dressed, ain't ya? D'you wanna go somewhere private? Talk? Why? I've got nothing to hide from anyone here, have I? Des? All one big happy family here. You, me, the McCoys. And Jimmy's great big fucking chemistry experiment. - I've got an office. - Have you?! I know, actually. Um... Ozzy told me. Well, lead the way, Jimmy boy. Jimmy, remember when I first left prison, do you remember what I said to you about both of us being... Well, being special? Yeah. Yeah, good, good. Cos, um... I really believed it, you know? I mean, that's how I've always seen it, even these last few years. You know, both of us having something...special. - Together. - Look... No, just be quiet for a second, Jimmy. Don't speak, just for a minute. I mean, you don't really have to say anything because... cos I know what's happened here. Ozzy...may have persuaded you to do this and may have said it was for the best and all of that. And I admit... I admit I haven't... haven't been all that reliable... ..lately. Eh? But I never ever expected you to go behind my back like that. Never. Eh? I'm sorry. Really? Look, it's business, yeah? It don't change anything... Don't be so bloody naive, yeah? Everything is fucked now because of you, because you chose this! Ozzy is playing you, Jimmy. No, he's playing you. Same way as he got me to play against Siddy. Yeah? That's what he's best at. There, you... Wait. Fred, what you doing? Sit down. Fuck off! We were special, Jimmy. Oh, shit. What are you doing, Dad? I'm just looking for something, mate. Why don't you live here any more? I do live here. Come here. What's the matter? What's this dark patch? Have you wet yourself? Oh, mate. Why don't you tell your mum? Oh, look... Come on, let's go and clean you up. Oh, mate. There you go, mate. He calls for you, you know. "Why doesn't Daddy come home? "Why doesn't Daddy come back?" And do you know what I say? I say, "Daddy's out with his whore bitch Patricia." Daddy doesn't really care about us any more, does he? Do you know, I ain't really in the mood for this, Jackie. - Really? - Nah. Well, tough! Tell me, Freddie, when are you gonna stop seeing that childless stuck-up bitch? Please, Jackie, let's not do this now, yeah? Why can't you stay at home and be a real father to your children? Or don't you have that in you, Freddie? You just leave me alone, right, or I swear I will fuckin' do you some mischief. Oh, you're man enough to have 'em but you're not man enough to love 'em. Just like your own dad! Sorry. What did you fuckin' say? Do you wanna know why I go to her? Do you really wanna know why I go to her? Cos being with her helps me forget what I fuckin' ended up with here! Go on, then! Run away! Why change the habit of a lifetime, Freddie Jackson?! Leave me to sort it out! We'll fend for ourselves! While you go and shove all our money up your fuckin' nose again! You're just a coward, Freddie! - What did you fuckin' say? - I said you're a fuckin' coward! Thank God for Jimmy or we'd all be done for. Fuckin' 'ell, Jackie. Jesus. It's nothing. He's a fuckin' animal. Don't be like that, Mags. He's never done this before. He's never touched me. Listen. You have to leave him, right? It wasn't his fault. It was me. I was out of line. I'm sorry. Sorry. OK? Maggie... Jimmy's upstairs. - Where's Freddie? - What? - Where is Freddie? - He's in the lounge. What the hell is wrong with you, Freddie? Are you out of people to bully? You're spoiling the view, babe. Only scum like you could do that to his own wife! Maggie, go home, yeah? Before I forget that you are a relative. I'm no relative of yours, you piece of shit! I'm gonna get her to divorce you. - What did you fuckin' say? - She should have done it years ago but I swear I'm gonna make her do it now! - What you need to do... - I'm not scared of you, Freddie! I'm not scared of you! You're a born fuckin' loser, Freddie, and everyone can see that now! You need to get a lead and a fuckin' collar for that one! Get your hands off me! - Don't go visiting the red-light districts. - Babe. It's easily done. Room full of boys, all steamed up. Babe, we ain't going to Amsterdam on a bender. It's business. Come on! Come here, give us a kiss. I'll miss you. And when you come back we'll keep trying, OK?

Please go home, Freddie, please. Ah-ah. Hey, babe. Thought you'd be home. You must have just popped out. Anyway, we'lre here now. l'lll call you later. l love you. That's how you make a fuckin' baby. Huh? - Do you want me to get that? - Just get out! - Regretting this already? - Jimmy's gonna kill you for this! Why don't we tell him all about it? Please... Oh... Let's face it. We both know what Jimmy's like, don't we? I remember when we was kids growing up, Jimmy had this weird thing where he didn't wanna play with toys which was broken. D'you know what I mean? Even if you could fix them so they would work again, he'd just... plain old fuckin' ignore 'em. Please go, please. 200,000 peopIe are gathered in London this evening for an epic street party... It's gonna be a really great year for us. I can feel it. All three of us. For a long while we all thought you was firing blanks, mate. - Freddie, shut up! - We all said that! - No we didn't! - I never, never said that! Well, you can all rest assured, I sorted it, didn't I? They're counting down! Quick! Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... Happy New Year! Happy New Year. Mum... Mum. Mum, I put them on by myself. Sleep tight. What can I say? It's just not so profitable for us now, Jimmy. Jimmy. You understand this? There's still a recession out there. Listen, mate. There are no new terms. Ahmet. Your product has become diluted. Oh, yeah? What, you think we're cutting it before selling it? Test it for yourself. This is from your last batch. We're not shifting our position. Your cousin Freddie said you were a reasonable man, that you'd negotiate. That's why we came today, in good faith. Freddie doesn't make the decisions round here. Fine. We'll be seeing you. It's OK. We understand. - What are they kickin' off for? - I don't know. - What are you thinking? - Where the hell is Freddie? Huh? You don't have to go. You do know that, don't you? He's expecting me. He'll suspect, otherwise. No, I wanna see him one last time. Come here. Come here, come here. And what has that bastard actually left us? Mm? You and me. - Nothing. - Right. Right, well, this is the only way that things can actually change, babe. Hm? You do know that, don't you, Pat? I hate those fuckin' Turks. Don't trust 'em. Oh, neither do I, but we need 'em, don't we, so it don't matter. Better not balls it up. What's the matter, you old mare? You're not crying? No. Just a bit run-down. Pat? No one's getting to you, are they? No. I'm fine. Just...I've got a cold. Harry? Come here. - Got a tissue, mate? - Yeah, sure. Thanks. Here you are, babe. Thanks. - Yes! - Happy birthday! Cheers! Here you are, here you are. There you go! Happy birthday, my boy! He's growing up nice and handsome, isn't he? Looks just like his dad. Yeah? Cheers, mate. - What do you say? - Thanks. Oh, you're welcome, my son. Come on, open it up, then. Pull it off, pull it off. - Ooh! - Go on, rip it open. Quick! Say hello to the devil. Hey, Mags, what's this counter made out of? Italian marble. Blow me! Italian marble! Better not put my fag out on it, then, eh? Give it a rest, Mum. Do you need any help, Auntie Mags? No, I'm all right, love. Actually, can you get the jelly out the fridge? So, what do you think of it, then, eh, Jimmy? It's my favourite present ever, Uncle Freddie. Yeah? So, champ, are you gonna show me around your castle? Yeah? Come 'ere! Scallywag! Right... Oi, don't break that, Freddie. - I'm the king of the castle. - What's that? - I'm the king of the castle. - That you are, my boy. Ha-ha! - So, how many bedrooms has this gaff got? - Seven. When are you gonna start on the other five kids? You'd better hurry up, eh? And what? End up like you? Stop! What do you mean, stop? Give him to me! Just...come here, Jimmy. - He's got my eyes, hasn't he? - Come here. Don't you think it's time that we, er... we had another one? - Yeah? - Keep your hands off. We could always run away, you know, the two of us, just start again. Keep an eye on him, will you? Why, where you going? Just going to lie down. Got a headache. - You all right? - All right. What's wrong with her? I don't know any more. Come here, mate. - Jimmy! - Look at the cake! For the birthday boy! Go on, mate. Give it a good blow. That's the way! Is there nothing you won't stop at? - What you talkin' about? - You gonna try it on with Maggie now? Oh, are you pissed already? I saw you trying it on with her. Who says I have to try? Get a lift home with your mum, yeah? I'm off. - Des. Come in. - All right, Jimmy? - How are you, mate? - Yeah, um... - What's the matter? - Ozzy's been stabbed. - What? - He might live. It's touch and go. What's happened? - Ozzy's been stabbed. - Is he dead? - Well, no, not yet. - I think it was one of the Turks. One of Ahmet's cousins. You have to be ready for 'em. They'lre gonna come for you next, Jimmy. Sooner or later. I know. - Let's talk in the morning, Des. - All right. What's the matter? Can't sleep? I'm scared. I'm scared for you. Don't be. I heard him say it. They're gonna try and kill you too. Don't be silly, no one's gonna do that. I'm not stupid, Jimmy. It's obvious what's going on here, I mean... Nothing is gonna happen to me. Or you. Or our little Jimmy. All right? I promise you. Eh? Jimmy... Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy! - What's the matter with you? - Nothing's the matter! - You seem so far away these days. - I'm just worried about you! I'm going to go and try and sleep. Didn't expect this, you know. Ozzy's got a lot of enemies, it's to be expected. No, it's a turf war now. Pure and simple. You talk to 'em more than me. What have they said to you? I don't know where this shit's coming from. Last time the Turks come down the docks, Ahmet was well bloody pleased with everything. - Yeah? - Yeah. Cracking jokes, tipping the boys, all sorts. He even invited us both to his daughter's bloody wedding. Just don't seem right to me. Why not? I didn't think the Turks had the balls to do this. Do you remember when we used to tear around here on our bikes? You remember that summer... really hot, '76? You was seeing that bird with the squinty eye, weren't you? - Who? Rosie Phillips? - That's it, Rosie Phillips! And I was shaggin' her sister, Lucy. Fuckin' 'ell, the things that Doris wanted me to do to her. Filthy. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, you had that jacket. - What jacket? - That leatherjacket you always wore. Always wanted one like yours. All right, Jimmy. What are you two gabbing about? Hello, J. Here, do you remember Freddie's jacket back when we were kids? - Don't. - The one with the studs? - Yeah. - Yeah! But listen to this, yeah? He wore it on our first date, and he strutted around like Elvis! What happened to it? Er... The old man threw it on the fire. Told me I had to get a suit, go out earning. Bastard. OK, Freddie, come on. You ready? We gotta go. You better be ready, Freddie, I'm telling you. Freddie? Open this door now or I'm gonna clobber you! I'm not scared of you! Freddie! Open it now or I'm gonna call your dad. Do you hear me? I'm calling him now! And what's he gonna do? He's never fuckin' here! Freddie, this is your last chance before I ring him. Right! That's it, I'm calling him. He's running away from you, you stupid old cow! - What? - He's running away with Auntie Maggie! I heard him say it to her. What?! When did you hear your dad say that? Come on, baby. Tell me. When did you hear your dad say that? What? Nah. Nah. I was just thinking. You know, we've never really seen eye to eye, have we? How do you mean? And I'm... I'm truly sorry about that. I feel I've always been a little bit... jealous of you. Jealous? Yeah, you know. Me and Jimmy have been mates for so long, then you come along, kinda pissing in our water, innit? Suddenly you're his best mate, the one he trusts, the one he turns to. Maybe if you weren't such a pissed-up cokehead... - No. No, it's a fair point. - Yeah. I'm glad we're getting it out like this, Desmond, you know? I always really admired your frankness. It's Des. Where's the ship? Just up here, Des. You all right, love? See you later, OK? I'll come pick you up from Grandma's. - You got my mum booked in this afternoon? - No, why? You're not booked in today, Mum. Put a sock in it, love, yeah? I didn't come here for one of Maggie's special cuts. - Are you all right? - You tell me, sis. - Have you been at the bottle already? - Keep your nose out of it, Mum, yeah? - Do what? - Yeah. - Come on, let's go in here. - No! I want to talk about this right here in this poncey little shop of yours. OK. Get it out. How long you been after my Freddie? You are joking, right? I've seen it with my own eyes. You two circling each other like vultures. - Right, get out... - No! I am not leaving till you tell me the truth, you fuckin' slag! Try and front this out, you little bitch. Been flashing your goods at him for a bloody long time. - Mum, shut up. - Don't worry about it. Now I think it through... it all makes sense. What makes sense? You've always been jealous of me being with Freddie. - You're mental, Jackie. - Right from the start. The way you looked at him! I should have realised... - You stupid cow... - Oh, God! It's so bloody obvious! You've been pining for him all this time, haven't you? I can finally see it. What's the matter? Is Jimmy not man enough for you? - Don't he do the business downstairs? - Stop this, Jackie. Come on. I know a good place to play. How's our Maggie doing these days? What? You're close, ain't ya? You must have noticed she's been down in the dumps lately. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - Oh, come on, Des. We all know that Maggie and Jimmy have got a few problems. I mean, it's hardly a secret. She walks around with a face like a rainy day. - What are you talkin' about? - Jimmy can't perform, yeah? It's driving poor old Maggie to the end of her tether. Is that why you need my husband, yeah? Cos yours can't get it up? - You stupid... - Fuck off, you little slut! Do you hear me? Fuck off. Don't touch me. - I fucking hate your husband! - Oh, yeah. I'd never let that piece of mongrel scum anywhere near my body! - Yeah. - Don't you get that, Jackie? Even with your shit for brains! I'd rather die than have that fucker touch me. Where's little Jimmy? - What? - Where's he gone? Fuck... - Freddie? Freddie? - Jimmy? Freddie! Jimmy! - Jimmy? - Freddie! Jimmy! Jimmy's a jaffa, mate. There's no juice in the moose. - Don't be an idiot, he's got a son. - It's not his, though, is it? - What? - Believe me, I know that for sure. Jimmy, not his dad. How would you know that? Because little Jimmy, yeah... Oh, yeah. Little fella's definitely mine, without a doubt. And our Maggie knows that too. Do you remember when you flew out to Amsterdam to open up the lab there, yeah, about five years ago? Well, that night, I broke in to Jimmy's... and I raped Maggie. Mm? And lo and behold, nine months later... You wanna know what the funny thing is? I love that kid. I really love that little boy. Maybe even more than my other kids. And I can't even see him. God! It feels good to get this off my chest. It's all my fault. Don't worry, love. We have every available officer looking for him. You don't understand. I've been awful to him. - My own son. - It's not your fault. Don't be so hard on yourself. It is. God, I'm a terrible mother. Where are we going, Freddie? We're gonna look at the trains. You like trains, don't you? Oi! What are you doing?! Come away from there! I said come away! Two-three. Yeah. Any word. All right. OK. Roger that, over. They're OK. Oh! My Freddie! - Oh, God! - Oh! - Oh, my God! - I'm never gonna let him go again. Never! It's OK. It's OK, babe. Oh, God! Oh, God! What were you doing? Freddie. Please, look, I'm... I'm not gonna hurt you, OK? We just wanna know, yeah? What were you doing running away like that? The shouting. I just wanted to get away from all the shouting. You really scared Mummy today. Promise me you won't go off like that again, OK? - Yeah. - Yeah. Who's my boy? Sleep tight. - How are you feeling? - Bloody awful. How's Maggie and the little 'un? Yeah, they're good. They're good, thanks. It's like the crocodile from Peter Pan. Tick-tock, tick-tock. They're gonna come for you. Yeah, I know. You know who it was? Yeah. The Turks. Must have been planning this for months. No. Jesus Christ. Open your friggin' eyes, Jimbo. The Turks need somebody on the inside. Someone who can give 'em all we got. All our roots. All our contacts. No, he wouldn't... No, he wouldn't go that far. - Not even Freddie would do this. - No... Not just Freddie. Patricia. My little sister. My own flesh and blood. Hurts, don't it? I'm already taking care of Patricia. You've gotta take care of your end. Cleanly and quickly. But, er... Do you know this for certain? I mean... How can you be sure? Don't be a fool. Do you think he'd think twice about doing the same to you? Freddie's an animal. When the time comes... you have to be able to kill someone you love. Don't you understand? Ozzy is awake. He's talking to Jimmy and he knows it was me. There's nothing to link you. He knows it was me, this is bloody Ozzy we're talking about. Pat, it's OK, yeah? Well, gentlemen, I think we can safely say that Ozzy is well out of our reach. But Jimmy don't know this was you. Not for certain, anyway. We haven't been talking much of late, so... Your wives are still sisters. I'm sorry, what's your fuckin' point? We need to cut Ozzy off from his world. Right now. - I thought we were gonna speak to Jimmy. - Come on, Freddie. You knew this was going to happen sooner or later, whatever we did to Ozzy. I'd rather it was you than one of the kebab delivery boys. In Turkey we would seal your filthy mouth with cement. Oh, yeah? Well, this is the EU. - Freddie. - What's that? It's gotta be you, OK? You're the only one that can get close enough to him. - Where is your khazi, mate? - It's upstairs. Make sure you cover the whole area there. All right? Right. There's an engagement party for my daughter. It's next week. Jimmy'll be there. I can fix it with Tony, so I'm waiting upstairs in the pub. No. No, I'm not doing it at the party. Not in front of his family. You might not get a better chance, Jimmy. No. It's Kim's engagement. She works for me wife. He won't be so bloody scrupulous. Remember what he did to Siddy? I'll figure out a way to get him to come out to my car. Do you want me to wait in the car park before you? No. I want you to stay in the pub. That way he won't be on his guard. I'm really sorry. It's the booze. It makes me paranoid. - You should do something about the booze. - Well... I'm really trying. Is he still seeing her? Yeah. I'm doing this for Kim. Tonight's her night. Jesus, Rox, turn that bloody racket down! I mean it, right this minute! I swear I'll chuck that beatbox off the edge. Jesus, you can't call that noise music. - I quite like it. - You're getting old, Mum. Stuff you listen to! What the fuck's wrong with Fleetwood Mac, eh? Your mum used to be a right rock chick, didn't you? Damn right. I run away with this band once. I spent five months on the road with them, remember? Oh, yeah! What were they called again? The Gasoline Engines! Do you remember, they were right into their motorbikes? Mum and Dad went completely spare, didn't they? - How old were you? - God, Roxanna's age. - Fifteen?! No! - Yeah. And remember the singer dumped me in that camp site in Camber Sands - and I had to hitch home. - Yeah, and Dad had to come and get you. And it's definiteIy cIean, yeah? Yeah. - When are you coming round? - In about an hour. Freddie... I saw... I saw a couple of men sitting in a car outside...last night. And, um... ..l haven'lt got any milk. Don't worry about it, babe. I'll check it out when I get there, yeah? Yeah. Be quick, love. And get this, right, Jacks used to turn up to Faces nightclub... Oi... ..with a copy of Shoot magazine in her handbag, - to tell who the footballers were. - Shut up, Mags! - All right, girls. - That's your mum. - Mags. - Freddie. Aw, Dad, that suit looks smashin'. Yeah? Well, it's my daughter's engagement party, innit? Where's Freddie? I'm gonna drop him off at your mother's before I meet you at the bar. Oh, you're a diamond. Oi, Freddie, come on in. There's a good boy. Make sure Tony puts a good keg on tap, cos you know how tight he is, don't you? How's Jimmy? I haven't seen him for a while. Yeah, he's good. He'll be there tonight. Right, I'm gonna be about five minutes, yeah? You keep the door locked. Fuck! Oh... Dad? Are you OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, son. - Hi. There you go. - Ohh...! Mags will pick him up later. Come on, sweetheart. Hey, your cousin's here already. - What, little Freddie's here too? - Yeah, we got both the rascals tonight. Down you go, darlin'. Yeah, Freddie dropped him off half an hour ago. Yeah, but don't worry. They ain't gonna leave my sight. Right. Be good, junior. Something bothering you, love? - No, I'm fine. Maybe see you later. - Mm. Yeah. Oh, hey! Look at you! Where you been hiding yourself, babe? All right? Oh, I love you! Oh! Oi, it's like Mr Big here's too flash for us riffraff these days. - Good to see you, J. - You too. Hello, Uncle Jim. Is that for me? Thanks. Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus, is this real?! Oh, it's beautiful! Come on, let's have a look! Oh, it's so lovely, it's beautiful. Thank you! Let's get this stuff off and get that stuff on! Ooh! It's gonna be all right. Oh, you're so lovely, you are! Oi, shots! Whoo! It's a lovely necklace you got Kim. - It's nothin'. - No, she's really made-up. Well done. - What's he like, her man? - What, Tony? - He's young. - Is he hungry for it? Well, they all are these days, aren't they? Can't wait to be earning big time. He hangs on every word I say. You're a legend to him. - If only he knew, eh? - Reminds me of someone. Nah, you always had a bit more going on upstairs. Even back in the day. Let's face it, Tony's never gonna win Mastermind but he will look after my Kim and he's good to Jacks, he drops in on her when I'm not about. That's what counts. I always thought that would be us someday. - Huh? - Old fuckers. Proppin' up the bar, swapping bull stories about how fat our wives' arses are. It will be, won't it? Yeah, yeah. I was thinking we could go for a drive later. Sure. There's a few things I wanna talk to you about. Yeah, just give it a couple of hours, eh? How's Ozzy? He's good. He's better. Yeah, that's what Patricia tells me. OJ Simpson, who is suspected of murdering his ex-wife NicoIe Brown... Why's he driving so bloody slowly? I reckon he's definitely murdered his missus. - Grandad? - Yes, mate? Can I go to the toilet, please? You don't need to ask permission, lad. Course you can. Mind you don't wake little Jimmy. PoIice beIieve he is heading to his mansion in Brentwood. Over 20 helicopters have been following... Oi, get some more drinks in, yeah? Go on! Where is he, where is he, where is he? You've covered him up! He can't breathe. He can't... - It's all right, darlin'. I'm here. - It's all right. - Mummy's here. - He's gonna be all right. Oi, Freddie, is that you, mate? Freddie! It was this new toy we bought him, a digger. See, it come wrapped up in that bag. But we didn't think anything about it, did we, Joe? No, because our Jimmy's a clever boy. He knows not to play with things like that. And anyway, he was asleep. I swear it, I know he was, I sung him to sleep myself. He must just have got up and fetched that bag. But I don't know why he put it on his head. - Was it you that found him, Mrs Summers? - No, miss, it was me. Cos he didn't want me to see him like that. Where are they? Come on, then. Come in. We've given her something to help her rest. Where's Jimmy? He's in the morgue, with the little boy. Oh, my poor love. I'll stay with her. Right. I'm gonna look after you. You're gonna be fine, all right? Oh, God... Oh... Come here. Come on, darling, come on. All right. Come on. Has he gone? Has he really gone? Mum? I am so, so sorry. No... God didn't want him to live, did he? Where... Where's Freddie? Does he know? The plastic bag... was tied to his head. - What did you say? - The plastic bag. It was tied to little Jimmy's head. What do you mean, tied? Tied with string. I got rid of it before anyone saw. No, he couldn't do that. Little Jimmy couldn't even tie his own laces. It wasn't little Jimmy. It was little Freddie. Little Freddie did this to him. I wanted you to be here... when I told him that. Jimmy... Jimmy, I don't know what to say. Stay the fuck away. He was... He was my baby. What can I do? Tell me. This is what you've created. Your fucked-up kid has killed my lovely boy! I'm sorry. Well, that's not enough! That's not enough now! Wh... What do you want me to do about this? I never want to see... that little monster ever again. What does that mean? Jimmy, what does that mean? This is your fault. He's grown up a fuckin' killer like you! Well, go on. Do it if you're gonna do it. My little boy. Freddie, don't move. Freddie! Freddie! Come here! Let me go! I didn't do anything! Mum! - Don't fucking move! - I didn't do anything! Please, Dad. Don't hurt me. How could you do that to little Jimmy? He was so fucking little! How could you do it? Look at me. Why did you do it? Eh? - Are you gonna hurt me? - How could you do it? Because you loved him more than me. What are you doing to him?! - Leave him alone, Dad! - Freddie, get off him! - Are you OK? - Jesus! What's wrong with you, Dad?! God... What's going on? Why did you attack him like that? Well? That poor fucker in there, he never had a chance, did he? What do you mean? Well, how come, right, little Jimmy, he's so sweet and angelic and how...how Freddie just turns out like that? I mean... what has our Maggie got that you haven't? She has Jimmy. Yeah? - Oh, that's fuckin' ripe, that is. - Yeah. - She's got Jimmy. - Yeah. Jimmy. That's who she has. Yeah, well, I bet that makes a fuckin' difference to her. Freddie, wait. What's going on? Please. Get some sleep, babe. I'm gonna be gone for a while. Never even worn these. Or these. Leave it, Mags. Didn't ask to be born. Poor sweetheart. He didn't stand a chance. Maggie, don't do this to yourself. What are you doing? - What are you doing with his stuff? - Packing it away. Why? He's not even in the ground yet. It needs to be done. Jesus Christ, Maggie. How can you be so cold? Don't you fucking tell me what to feel! He's gone! And I'm trying to do what I have to do. Wanna hear something funny? I got a new lawyer. A real hottie. Asian. This bint's really shaken up my case for parole. Thinks the prison service has been deliberately negligent in its treatment of me. That's great, Ozzy. If I was outside, I tell ya, we wouldn't be in the bloody mess we are now. Oh, oh... You think I'm being harsh, do you? I'm sorry about your little 'un, Jimmy, truly I am. But you must realise, there's no mercy for the weak out there. Don't let them see you hurting. Cos that's when they come for you. You gotta finish what you started. Take out the Turks and then... take out Freddie. - That's what I plan to do. - Good man. But not because you fuckin' tell me to. I'm gonna do it because all this has gone far enough. - Sit down, Jimmy. - Fuck off, Ozzy! - Why's he not dressed? - Cos he's not goin' to no funeral. - Why not? - Cos he's too young, that's why. Yeah. You're right. Well, what we gonna do with him, then? Er...Joseph's gonna have him. I spoke to him, sorted it. Oh, thank God. Thank God we're all all right. Can you imagine... what they're going through? What it must feel like to lose a kid like that. Thank God, thank God. You can't...! It's all right. You're gonna have to keep an eye on her at work. Help her out a bit. She doesn't accept help. She ain't built that way. What's up with your mum? Fuck knows. She hasn't said anything since we got here. What are you doin' here? I wanted to be here for him. - I know about everything you've done. - Really? What do you know? Tell me. I know about you and the Turks. I know about you and Patricia, about the hit on Ozzy. I know you were set to kill me after Kim's engagement. This is it for you. After today... you're a dead man. Ha... Something funny? Yeah, Jimmy... Jimmy, Jimmy. You think you know so much. But you don't. - You know fuck-all. - Really? What don't I know? You should have shot me at the morgue, mate. But then that's always been your problem, hasn't it, Jimmy? You've got no balls. Got no real man's spunk in you. Do you know what I mean? Mm? Don't forget. If it weren't for me, you would still be working on Cortinas at Kwik Fit. - When I'm done with you... - Mm. ..I'm gonna go after that murdering son of yours and I'm gonna cut his throat. All right? We was just saying what a lovely little boy our Jimmy was. You shouldn't be here. Oh, I have more right than anyone else to be here, and you know that. - Just go. - Eh? He was our boy. Yeah? I know that. You know that. And one day, everyone else will know that. I'm goin' home. Oh, are you pissed again? Nice. We were never gonna have this, were we, Freddie? What? You never wanted any of this with me, did you? That's why we live in such a shithole, isn't it? I have no idea what you are talking about. But I am goin' home. I was the wrong bloody sister. Oi... Tony, Tony. Get us another whisky, mate. Do you know that Jimmy wants to kill me? Do you wanna know why? Do you wanna know why he wants to kill me? Cos I'm the fuckin' daddy. Jesus. Are you hurt? No. It's not my blood. What is going on with you, Jimmy? Talk to me. - I used to feel like you didn't love him. - What? Used to break my heart watching him... look up at you, need your love. But you just couldn't give it to him. But then you changed. Ohh! God's sake. Jimmy's gonna kill me. What? Oi... You'd better get Freddie out of here, you'd better get him as far away from here as you can. Well, why little Freddie? Huh? Eh? Why little Freddie? Cos Jimmy's gonna come after him an' all. Why would Jimmy hurt little Freddie? Eh? Freddie killed my little boy! I knew it. Little Jimmy was your boy, wasn't he? He was your boy, wasn't he? I loved him so much. Oh, God... - Jimmy. - Fred. Look, mate, we really need to meet up, don't we, sort all this shit out. Name a time and a place. Jimmy boy, you sound so different these days. - Just tell me, Fred. - Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot I need to tell you, mate. Stop fuckin' me about! 6pm tonight, see you at Tony's. No, please... No! No... - What did you say? - No more, please. Don't worry. You'll meet your brother very soon. - Where are we going? - Grandma's gonna be taking you. You're gonna be staying with her for a while. What about you and Mum? I don't wanna be by myself. Look, Fred, all right? Mate, I am not gonna lie to you. All right? You are going away because of what you done to little Jimmy. I know why you did it as well, and I'm... I'm sorry, actually, because... that's my fault. You know. I should have done better by you, mate. We all should have done better by you. - I don't wanna go! - I know, but you have to, cos otherwise Uncle Jimmy's gonna kill you. Do you understand? Mate. Just gotta be a bit brave. Come on. - When will Mum see me? - She'll come and see you soon, I promise. - What about you? - Soon! Get in the car, go on. Here y'are, babe, look. That should keep you going for a while, yeah? What's gonna happen between you and Jimmy? I dunno. I brought you up to watch out for each other. I want it like yours. What? I want it like your hair. - Sharon. - Yeah? Leave that now. Go and have an early lunch, yeah? OK. I'm gonna have to take quite a lot off. Is that gonna be all right? Do you think Freddie'll like it? Cos that's all that really matters to me. OK, babe. What's going on? I just want to look like you. For Freddie. - I know. - You know what? I know about little Jimmy. Freddie told me. He was drunk out of his skull so I know it was the truth. - What truth? - Don't fuckin' play games with me, Maggie. Do you remember when I came in here before? And I said you were making eyes at my Freddie? Oh... And to think... you'd already been there. And not only that... you went and had a bloody kid with him too. My little sister. No flies on her. Jackie, he raped me. Don't give me that shit. I know you seduced him. He broke in to our house and he dragged me from the bath. Shut up! And when he'd finished in me, he...he spat in my face just to make sure I knew what I was to him. No. And I used to...to watch Jimmy holding his son like he was the most precious thing in the world. And all the time I knew that, um... that that lovely... lovely little boy... was born out of...out of rape. How do think that made me feel, Jacks? I don't believe you. How late is he now? Half-hour. Remember, when you've poured those first drinks, you go in the back. Whatever you say, Jimmy. Thinkin' about me? What do you want? Er... I've been hurtin'. - Just like you. - What? It's been killin' me actually, I... All I wanted to do, right, is be near you and share it... Share it?! Yeah. He... He was our boy, Mags. - No. - What? Come on, you know it as well as I do inside you. We-We both made that beautiful boy. - And I loved him. - He was never yours to love! Do you understand? My little Jimmy was never yours to love and that is exactly why he was a beautiful boy. Oh, don't be like that, Mags. How could a cold-blooded monster like you ever love anyone? Er... What did you say? Freddie, all you are is a cancer. Yeah? You're cancer. You're cancer in all of our lives. Right. There was I thinking... Are you fucking crazy? Yeah. Oh, well. Maybe Jimmy will kill me now. But he's never gonna look at you the same again, is he? - What do you mean? - After I have to tell him everything. Oh, it's the least I can do, innit, after all? Man to man. Don't do this. You can't tell Jimmy! All of this, right? All of it... is over for you now. Hm? No, it's not. Fuckin' 'ell, Maggie! Ahh! Oh, fuck. Fuckin' 'ell. Oh... I... Jackie, er... Can you fuckin' help, yeah? Maggie's gone mental. Ah... Fuck. What are you doin'? Oi. Call a fuckin' ambulance, yeah? Call a fuckin' ambulance, you stupid... - Oh, shit. - Jackie. Where's my phone? Oh, shit. Where... Fuckin'... Ahh... Uh... Give us a minute, will you, Stan? Thanks, mate. - Still no sign of Freddie? - No. - How long has it been now? - Five months. - What do you think happened to him? - You tell me. I told you back then. I had nothing to do with it. Jackie. - You all right? - Yeah. Come here. - So what's it like there? - Fine. We're making a go of it. I bought little Freddie a dog. Really? What kind? Labrador. Little Freddie chose her. He's called her Britney. Britney? Oh, God! He takes her for walks by the sea. You're by the sea, then? Jackie, why won't you tell us where you've gone? - Mum really wants to see little Freddie. - No, she can't. Why not? Cos I don't want anyone from round here to know. It's none of their bloody business. Well, can't you tell me? Then why did you go? I had to. For little Freddie's sake. Little Freddie...? Why? Cos I didn't want him growing up like his father. What are you thinking, Jimmy? Are you thinking what it's gonna be like when I'm out? No, I was thinking about Siddy. - And Freddie. - What about 'em? Well, they used to run things for you, didn't they, all this time you was inside. Things didn't turn out too well for them. One got a bottle in the neck and the other one has... disappeared, before I had a chance to shoot him. What's your point? I'm just thinking out loud, really. But things don't look too rosy for me, do they? Seeing as I took over from 'em. I like you, Jimmy. I always have. You got brains. The others...didn't. Not like you. You know who you remind me of? Me. No, no, no. You're gonna be useful to me when I'm out. Until I stop being useful. What? Well, that's how it is with you, isn't it? Eh? Use 'em and then...lose 'em. Don't make me an enemy, Jimmy. Enemy, friend. It's all the same with you. Freddie knew that. You're making one big fuckin' mistake. Did you think I didn't have the balls to do Freddie? Is that why you killed him? I was gonna kill Freddie! I didn't need your fuckin' help! Guard? This is over for you now, Jimmy. I didn't think I'd miss him. Not like this. - You spent most of your life with him. - Yeah. What a waste of time, eh? You can't think like that. You're more than just him. I'm glad for you, Mags. Really, I am. I'm glad it's all OK now. Yeah. I don't want your fuckin' pity. Not now. Not ever. We did something we had to do. And now it's all over. Right? Rest in peace, babe. Jimmy doesn't suspect anything? No. And that's how it's always gonna be. Thanks, Jackie. You're my little sister. Anyway, I'd better go. I've got a train to catch. OK. - How you gettin' on? - Yeah. I thank God every day. I ain't speaking to you again about this. Next time you piss me about, you'll get a visit in the night. - I tried to talk to the others... - Shut up! I'm speaking. I'm giving you a final bloody warning. Oh, you fuck...! Aaagh! Jimmy says goodbye, old man. What are you cooking? Chicken curry. Great! Dunno what's wrong with me at the moment but I could eat your curry every day. How is she? Yeah, she's all right. - She tell you where she lives? - No. Wouldn't say. I think she just wants people to stay away from her and little Freddie, to be honest. Probably for the best. How long's this gonna take, then? I'm Hank Marvin. Good things come to those who wait. Yeah.
