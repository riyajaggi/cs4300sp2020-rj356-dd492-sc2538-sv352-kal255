 I very much doubt it. You made accusations against our company. I'm looking into them. Your company is not my fucking problem any more. But you said it was Dr B0uchard's. Did she ever mention a place called Reverie? Fuck knows. But... your boss is a murderer and there's a witness floating about up there so I'd watch your back if I were you. Thanks for the drink. Dad? Hi, hi. - You a/r/ght? - Yeah, I'm alright. - You alright? - Yeah, I'm coming up.

 Eh? Alright. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Oh, thank fuck for that. Oh, fucking hell. Yep. Come on in. Alright? - Brought you some shopping. - Nice. You missed a few. Yeah, well, I didn't know you were coming, did I? Clearly. You need looking after. - Eh? - You need looking after. Yes, I do. Oh, you already emptied it. How thoughtful. Do you want coffee? Hey, hey. I'm sorry. - You OK? - Yeah. Hi, sorry. Just mind your head on the tap. - Here. Are these your shoes? - Yeah. - Where are their clothes? - Um, in the bed. Shoes are underneath. Chief, it's Denise. Ca!! me back, it's urgent. We found some tyre tracks over there... We need to talk to you. The car was doused in gasoline. And the victim had two bullet wounds in his chest. We've confirmed time of death as three days ago, between 18 and 24:00 hours. And eight witnesses who saw you leaving Randy“s Bar shortly before that timeframe. Oh, with a big black guy who happened to match the profile of the victim. We ran the plates. Victim“s name is Roger Crouch. A North Stream Oil employee. His physical description matches the guy you were seen leaving with. I wanna make a phone call. Can I help you? You filed a complaint against one of our employees - Monsieur Louis Gagnon? - Yeah. Some of the families up here didn't think much of you guys. Why would anyone have a problem with carbon capture? Taking the bad stuff and making it safe, right? Mr Gagnon was a little over-eager on getting our community on-side. We just asked him to ease off some. It was all sorted out. And how exactly did Monsieur Gagnon get people on-side? There might have been some... misunderstandings. Is he paying you? Are you accusing me of corruption? Oh. I just asked a question. I think y0u'd better leave. Dangerous out here for a rich white lady on her own. I'II have my deputy escort you to the perimeter. That won“t be necessary, thank you. I can arrange my own transportation. It must have been... I don't know... no later than six o'clock. No, no, it was exactly six o'clock. I remember because I had the radio on. - What station? - Bonjour FM. French Canadian. My French is shite, but they play really good music. If it was in French, how did you know the time? There's a clock on the radio. What“s this about? So, thereafter, Chief Worth was with you for the entire evening? That's right. Thereafter. - What did you two do? - We made love. Actually, no, that's not actually accurate. We fucked is what it was. My husband was drunk. Mrs Worth, is your husband violent when he“s drunk? You mean rough sex? I don't mean that, I mean... physical violence. He could hardly walk a straight line when he got home, much less land a punch, so... No. How did your husband get home, Mrs Worth? He drove himself. Is that what this is about? About drunk driving? I've told him... I've told him how strict you are about that here. And you're right. He should... Mrs Worth, do you recognise that man? No. Should I? What if we asked you to sign a witness statement to that effect? Would you do so? - A witness statement? - Mm. So this is an investigation? Jesus, what's happened? - How's Anna? - She misses her brother. She say anything? About what? Ask her. Jesus, Jim. How are you going to get out of this one? L'll think of something. You'd better fuckin' had. It should have been me. He was only five. He'd never hurt anyone. Everyone loved him. It wasn't meant for him. - What? - The bullet. It was meant for your dad. So? S0... maybe you'd be better off without him. I can't leave him. He's my dad. Why not? Where would I go? With me. Shit. Pull up a chair, handsome. - Sneak a preview. - Fuck off. - Something wrong? - No, love. Not at all. It's just the new supplier. It was a decent fake. You touch down in Vancouver three weeks ago. First thing you do is visit a specialist reptile outlet. Purchase a saw-scaled viper. The weapons, you acquire next day from your Contacts with the Vancouver heroin trade. One of them is an HCFP informant. Likely he would testify in court. If the Police Chief isn't onto you already he soon will be. Especially if I tell him what I just told you. - What do you want? - Don't buy guns from an informer. - What would I want guns for? - Come on, Frankie! Up your game. Show me you have what it takes to finish what you started. Kill him. Or I shut you down. You've got your own goons. Traceable to me. Why are you doing this? Let's just say, the Chief and I, we... have a score to settle. Ever seen that man? He worked for North Stream Oil. Excuse me, ever seen this man? What the fuck you starin' at, girl? - What? - I don't think we should do this. Why not? Because I care about you. So? More than I've ever cared about anyone. That“s sweet. Private lnvestigations. Can I help? Uh. yeah. Are you calling regarding e new or existing case? Existing. Case number? - 373. - 373. - Mr Dev//n? - That's me. We have a DNA match. - You're really gonna let him go? - No! - You alright? - Angela's lying for you. You think? I found this inside the burned out car. - Wild Buffalo, ifs your brand. - It's anyone's brand. Yet you're quite good at this cop thing. You're better than me anyway. You're a bit by-the-book, but you're above average. Nobody knows about this yet. You need to tell me the truth. All of it. Put your seatbelt on. Here, come here. His real name is Reginald Godswill. - How do you know that? - Well, I'm not exactly a cop, Denise. More of a criminal, really. Licensed by the state to catch other criminals. An undercover cop? Um-hm. About 20 years. Mostly hanging around the kind of arseholes that this man associated with. S0 he came here... to kill you and accidentally killed your son? Nah, that was a... That was a little fella. He's... he's still running around out there somewhere. Well... You're gonna need that if you wanna find him. Cheers. - Afternoon, Chief. - Alright? - Do you have an appointment? - Open up. Alrightey, can I ask the purpose of your visit? Murder inquiry. Gonna be searching some of your trailers here. Which one belongs to Roger Crouch? I'Il just need to talk to somebody first. Well, you're talking to somebody now. Sorry, Chief, there's protocol and all. Even with the Chief of Police. Number 6 to Number 1, we've got a problem here. Roger Crouch, you know him? - Work with him? - No. - Know where his trailer is? Nothing? - No, man. Absolutely nothing? State your business. Roger Crouch, who works for you. Want to search his trailer. - Warrant? - I don't need one. Place of work, remember? Residential accommodation, not a workplace. - No warrant, no search. - Oh, for fuck's sake. - I'm done fighting. - Who's fighting? I'm just trying to find the fella who killed my kid, that's all. - Yeah, I could've helped you. - You still could. I could let you off for assaulting a police officer, if that'd help? - I could shut down the Bouchard case. - What case? Your witness disappeared, and besides you broke into my home and tried to strangle me, motherfucker. And a man like you, he makes too many enemies, Mr Devlin. Get out of Little Big Bear. While you still can. Merci. You're still gonna have to wait. You know what? Just take a seat for me, alright? Sit down. - What were you two talking about? - The case. You're discussing the case with the prime suspect? Oh, what the hell is wrong with you, Denise? Anyone else would be all over this guy, instead you're slamming on the brakes you“re sneaking off for some cosy fucking tête-á-tête! - Tête-á-tête? - Stop it! Don't cut me out. OK, Denise? - I'm a good cop. I don't deserve that. - I'm not cutting you out. Then what were you two talking about? Chief has decided not to make his resignation official. He's keeping his star. What the fuck? I see you, you don't see me. Guaranteed Mexican Army issue. The official Mexican Army, not some beaner dope cartel. Yeah, uh... just a gun, thanks. No problemo. Now, the beauty of these is they stow in your pants with little or no profile, but when they do come out recalcitrant patron immediately gets the message. I don't need to scare any drunks. Ijust need something I can use once and... the j0b's done. The job you have in mind being...? Stop something dead. Like a bear. We are attuned, friend. I have exactly what you're looking for. The Desert Eagle. Classic for a reason. Gas operated. .357 Magnum rounds. Put down any person or... bear you're ever gonna run into. Feel the feel. - 00h. - Yeah. - How much? - 550. Comp me in next Saturday night, the wet T-shirt shindig and I'll throw in these pups for 700. Bears come out at night, right? Gagnon. Yeah, she's here. - Letendre? - With some lady from North Stream. - What? - Yeah. She came sniffing around my office this afternoon. Asking questions. About you. Keep her there. There was no wind that night. C02 from one of your pipelines seeped out through a crack. It came in our place. It started downstairs. My kids' room. I thought they were sleeping! They were dead! I found Dr Bouchard's report. She was discredited because no one from your community came forward to corroborate it. Why? We signed NDAs. Some of us took money and... And some of us were intimidated, but not me. Is the man who paid them named Louis Gagnon? Yeah. I can help you. Yeah, that's what Dr Bouchard said, too. Just another fucking mighty white woman coming along trying to save the Indian squaws. AII I'd need you to do is sign some sort of testimony. Yeah, right. Then I end up like Suzy. What happened to Suzy? You can't fucking come here all dressed all fucking fancy like that and suck the oil from my land and fucking poison my kids and then expect me to trust you! Fuck that. Why are you talking to me if you don't trust me? I don't know. I don't know. You got kids? Two. Maybe that's why. Is there another way off this reserve? My brother-in-law“s place backs onto the highway. - Does he have a car? - Why? I've put you in danger being here. You need to come with me. Don't fucking tell me what to do. I ain't fucking doing anything you tell me to do. Fuck that. You're the only good thing that's happened to me since Petey died. Get dressed. What? I'm taking you home. I don't wanna go home. Home's shit. I wanna be here with you. Well, that's not gonna happen. We're done here. What? That was your first time, weren't it? Sounded like it. Crying like a fucking baby. It was fucking off-putting. Clean yourself up. We're going. Organised crime? Um-hm. - You said this was North Stream. - Yeah, I know I did. - You publically denounced them. - I know. I mean, that's what it says. Alright? I could've been right, could've been wrong. So the police were right? This is a... - local biker thing? - He's English. So what? I think it's got something to do with Jack. What? Fuck! So our son died because... of something you did? That was your first time, too, wasn't it? Wasn't me crying like a baby. It was you. Nothing you can do will ever hurt me. You were a mistake. - You really think this is a good idea? - He gets things done. If I killed our son, right. If I fucking killed our son do you really think it's a good idea to bring Jack here? What choice do we have? Oh, fuck it. You've come undone. Everything OK? - What's he gonna do? - Come inside. Evening, Mr Worth. Were you gentle? I don't know what you mean. When you fucked my daughter, were you gentle? Come on, come inside. Main gates to patrol. Emergency protoco! has been activated.

Why would a fella sent over here to kill me need to dress up as a biker? Maybe the North Stream robbery, it was a set up? Three guys who shot me dressed up as bikers and robbed a truck to try and get a shot at you? I need to know if this bullet... matches the bullet that was fired into my house. Put the gun down, you tit. Here you are. You might need that. Woah, woah. What the fuck is going on? OK, relax. Let's go. You know him? Guess so. Customer maybe. - Why? - British fella. Came here to kill me. Got two mates. Heard anything? Nope. I'll ask around, Chief. I'm going to ask you a question and I want a straight answer. Go on. That debt of honor that you came here to settle doesn't have anything to do with the Chief of Police, does it? - Who's asking? - The Chief of Police. What exactly is he asking you? He said that three Brits had come here to kill him. He asked me if I'd heard anything. - Holy fuck, Frank! - His real name is Jack Devlin. He doesn't know me from Adam, but he soon will. Jesus Christ. You said you had a loose end to tie up. Did that mean killing the Goddamn Chief of Police? - I haven't got a choice, love. - Frank, listen to me. I don't know what your debt of honor is and right now I don't give a shit. And I'm telling you, that man'd sooner kill you than give you the time of day. I know this. Walk. - Walk? - I'll cover for you. I'll buy you time. Walk out the back door and keep walking and don't turn back. - And leave you in the lurch? - No, I will join you. - Yeah? What about this place? - This is bricks and mortar, Frank. - I'd rather lose this place than you... - I am not running! That fucker has shat on my dreams once before I am not gonna let him do it again. Do you hear me? I will take care of it. For us. Then we'll be free. Let me just go out there and put him off the scent? - Please, Frank, please. - No, you“re not gonna do my dirty work. I'm gonna damn well try. You fucking walk. Nothing happens in this town I don't find out about sooner or later. Get wind of anything, l*ll let you know. Good. Cos... the men that tried to kill me, they fucked it up. They killed my boy instead. He was only five. Five and a half, if you're counting. Is there something you wanna tell me? No, ljust... Like I said, I'll ask around. Who's your new friend? Oh, he's, uh, a new partner. He's a backer, actually. I still run this place. Mind if I talk to him? - No, I'II go get him for you. - That's alright. I've got it. Wait, no.
