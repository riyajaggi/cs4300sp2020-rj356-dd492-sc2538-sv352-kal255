Leave me a message. Thanks, Could... could you drop me at Handy's? Randy' s? Yeah, on Main Street. The bar? Why? You looking for someone? Where are you going? You're going the wrong way. - Am I? - Yeah, town“s in the other direction. - Is it? - Just drop me here, I can walk back. What, with a bear on the loose? He fucking hit me. Bigger picture. Bigger picture. I could file an assault charge. - There's a teenage girl gone missing. - I was gone for two fucking minutes, D. What does this bed say to you? What do you mean, what does the bed say to me? Which box do we tick? Voluntary or involuntary? How the heck would I know? Does it say, 'Teenage girl arranged bed to make it look like she was in it so she could sneak out to meet boyfriendT Or does it say, 'Teenage girl dragged out of bed - kicking and screaming'? - Oh, for fuck sakes! No one was dragged anywhere, OK? I took a lousy piss and this... - Did you try calling her, Chief? - Straight to voicemail. - Have you seen my mobile? - We're going get this sorted. We have a few hikers gone missing each year. Where's Lehane? He's on his way. No sign of forced entry. Yeah, well, doesn't rule out abduction, does it? Abduction, Denise. I would have heard something. I w0uld've heard a struggle, a scream... You abandoned your post. Randy's you want to go to? Alright, I'II turn round. It“s no worries. The name's Whitey, by the way. You're English. S0 are you. There's a tonne of us out here for the refinery. - What about you? - Oh, my God! It's you! The... the... body-popper! That was, um... - There's no words for it. - ...amazingly weird. She's probably gone to see her mum. Then why'd she sneak out the back? Because I stuck your idiot fucking boyfriend on the door to stop her - doing anything stupid like that. - He's not my boyfriend. From now on you get to drive the fucking golf cart. Where's Anna? She... she's having trouble sleeping so I let her have a lie in. Who are you? Who am I? Who are you? I'm your husband. Which one? I miss him. Jack. You haven't called me that in a while. Ah, you're hurting me, love. Where's Anna? I want to see her. Boyfriend getting shit-faced, is he? It's Dad. At least I think he is. I'm sorry to hear it. Um. thanks. For... rescuing me. Anytime. How come I get to drive this shit-heap? The kid drives the fancy wheels, huh? I'm not made of money. Where the fuck is he? In Randy“s getting rat-arsed. You get the bag? It's complicated. I don't like complicated. Well I can“t just grab it off her, can I, Frank? Then she'd know. I got to act natural. Wait till she ain't looking then get it off her without her noticing. - How long“s that gonna take? - Blame Johnny. And count yourself lucky you've got me to clean up after his mess. So what, she found a Cigarette butt? What does that fucking prove? It's got your DNA all over it. I've got no motive. Maybe not. But I do. I'm your only alibi. Fucking little bitch. Lehane has your cell. - What? - Randy just handed it in. What? You were at the bar last night. So Lehane says that your phone is full of texts from Anna wanting to know where the hell you were. Where were you? - Is this a fucking interview? - It can be. Wait here. Fuck. Oh! Fuck. Holy shit Ia marde. He just remembered that he's married. Fuck. Where am I? What's wrong? We were just having some fun. Come on. SHE SCOFFS You had better remember my name, motherfucker. Where am I? - The rez. - What? The Reserve. Where's my gun? Hey? What happened to that guy I brought back here last night? Huh? The little firecracker. Where's my fucking gun? Hey? Do you think I'm a whore? My name is Jaclyn, you goddamn fucking son of a bitch. And you said you were going to help me. Help you? Don't you remember last night? You told me you were going to help. Holy shit. Fuck off. Anna. Jesus fucking Christ. Fuck. Where's Anna? I want to see her. So where were you? Hey, baby! Cunted, was he? Your dad. Yeah, he“s an alcoholic. How long since the last bender? Three years. Twelve Steps? The fat lot of good. We came here to make a new start. He stopped for my little brother, but then... And now I suppose I'm not enough. My mum always used to say 'A sober alcoholic wouldn't give her son away for all the whiskey in the world. But give her one drink and she'd sell him for the next glass.' Your mum's an alcoholic? Always was. Always will be. What's left of her. Point is, we can't trust 'em. Much as we love 'em. Why don't I take you home? Home's 6,000 miles away. Anywhere you wanna go, then. I don't care. What the fuck are you doing? Follow me. Let's go. 'Fuck you.' Sent at 2:21 a.m. Last missed call was... let me see. She made, four, five, six in total. 2:20. Why is she texting 'Where are you?' Went out for a beer. - When did you get back? - Dunno. Constable McGillen says that you got back to the hotel after six. Constable McGillen is a cunt. So you have no idea where you were between the hours of three when you were seen leaving Randy's and six when you got back to the hotel? My daughter has been missing since midnight last night. So you can't verify your whereabouts? I was blind drunk. Could she be trying to punish you? Maybe staying with a girlfriend or something? She doesn't have any friends. I forced her to come here. I got a splitting headache. - Will you help me find her? - Nick, painkillers. What am I, the pharmacist now? I can't get E Section's air support or any other additional resources until she's been missing for 24 hours. My son was murdered. We're going to need your computer as evidence and I need you to sign off on these medical forms. We done? Is he fit for duty? Would you be? Two can play Dad's game. Why should I be the only one who isn't in a fucking coma? I'm not Ietting anyone down. Why is this happening to us? A few days ago we were a nice, normal family. Hm. With a dad like yours? An alkie, I mean. None of this is your fault. I used to think if my mum loved me, she'd stop. But she didn't. - What happened to her? - She“s in a home. Bloody nice one, mind. Costs an arm and a leg. That's why I'm here. I can earn a packet as a vac truck driver. Doing the 12 hour shifts plus overtime. Yeah, hope she's grateful. She loves me in her own way. Can I have your attention, please? Is this on? Can you get this on? - Can I have your attention, please? Uh, four days ago an unidentified gunman shot and killed my son. And now my daughter's missing. I need some volunteers. Anyone willing to help look for her? - Thanks. - Anybody? Chief. Come here. These guys are just workers, they don't give a shit. You want me to round up some volunteers, you just say the word. - Alright, thanks. - OK. Unconfirmed reports of two trespassers near the municipal dam. Caucasian. One male, one female. Girl 's in her teens. Dam's on The Reserve, Chief. The police can't go on The Reserve without an invitation. OK, guys, line up over here. What the hell are you doing? - Assembling volunteers. - Why? A girl“s gone missing. We have an operation to run. It is not inconceivable that one of our employees is responsible for a missing teenage girl. It is unpleasant, but the more proactive we are, the better. I didn't authorise this. Are we a team, Monsieur Gagnon? - A team? - A team. You know, working together for a common goal. My goal is to get this refinery operational. Yours is to assist me. Anything else is a complication.

He's a good man, OK? He loves his family. If you hadn't lost touch with your own people you'd know by now. - Know what? - The kind of man you're dealing with. Yeah, bring her out. Oh. fuck. OK. He shouldn't have done what you say he did but he just lost his son. You don't have to punish him like this. Lawmen been fucking us for centuries.

Do something! Petey used to make these little models and leave them by my bedside. I never knew what the hell they were, they all looked like demented snowmen. It has this horrible smell. Smell it. Fuck. It dries out. Then it starts to crumble. Look. My little brothers crumbling to dust. Whitey. I just remembered. What? That bloke, you know... you know the one who won the Karaoke contest. Yeah. He was down by the river the day before Petey was murdered. He what? I remember thinking it was weird at the time. It was like he was sort of watching the house. - Are you sure it was the same bloke? - I'm dead sure. Have you told anyone? I should have told Dad. Not that he cares. If he gave a shit about us he wouldn't be out getting pissed, would he? He doesn't care so why should I? What's the bloody point anyway? There's nothing left. Nothing left to stop me. Stop you what? I could just lean forward and it would all be over. My bag! Petey's things. You going to go in after it? You think I won't? What the fuck is he playing at? He's going to kill her. Give it here. Push me. Please. I can't. Give me the gun. If he hasn't got the balls to do it then someone else has to. Alright? None of this is your fault. - Let me go. - No. - We have company. - Right, we gotta get out of here now. Leave it! You swore. You swore on my life. - You fucking promised... - I know. I'm sorry, I...
