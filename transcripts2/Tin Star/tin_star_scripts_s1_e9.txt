Look at the state of you. - What did you tell him? - Nothing. Nothing. I ain't told him anything. He doesn't know anything. Is that what you care about? You know it isn't. Don“t you care about me, Frank? Of course I do. I love you. You're me sister. Half-Sister, remember? Oh, yeah, half-Sister. Come here. Come here. You know, if it gets out that the Old Bill are on to me, I'm fucked. No one will go near me. I'II lose everything. Years and years of fucking grafting. Are you gonna kill him, Frank? Hmm? Kill him. - Will you kill him for me? - He's a cop. - Please. - You don't kill cops. No, don“t you know what he's done to me, Frank? He come in here and he“s fucking humiliated me. - He fucking raped me, Frank! - Enough! You got no fucking self-respect, Frank. Enough!

Oi. Alright, Simon? She betrayed me, Frank. This isn't their fault. You brought me here. This is your mess, you clean it up. He's Old Bill. You take Helen and the boy youleave and you don't come back. Foxy. Where are you going? None of your fucking business. You know what she's been like. - Years me and you been through... - Fuck off. Come here. Come here. Alright, mate? Can you let me out? You lied. I know. I know I did, but I got to get to a hospital. And then I can come back for you and your mum. What about your real family? Listen... Your dad's gonna fucking kill me and then he's gonna kill your mum. You got to let me out, mate. Five. Four. Three. Two. Look after your mum, alright? Alright? Where are you going? I can't stay here. I can't stay... I can't stay here. I can't stay here. Listen! Listen! Alright. Now, I'm gonna get cleaned up, and I'm gonna come back for you and your mum. When? Soon. Promise? Promise. I waited. And I waited. But he never came back. I tried to keep the dogs alive as long as I could, but... when Mum tried to drink herself to death, they all starved. One by one. What did you do? They put me in care. And so I spent 10 years trying to find him. Track him down. Make it right. By killing a child? That was never meant to happen. I swear. - You fired into a car with a kid in it. - He ducked. You pointed a gun at a fucking family. He's a coward, Anna. You're pathetic. Don“t say that. You're the most pathetic person I've ever met. - Anna, please, don't. - Don't touch me. No, don“t leave, Anna. Don“t you ever leave me. Corrected & Synced by Bakugan
