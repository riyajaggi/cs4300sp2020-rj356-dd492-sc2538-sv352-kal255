 You pull harder. I got a God-damn shovel in my hand! Give it to me. Oh, shit. OK. OK. Let's go. - Hello. - Hey, ifs Denise. Ijust got in and saw your cameras are down. - Everything OK? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's fine. - Do you want me to come check it out? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's probably just a power cut. Well, I should come check it out. Just to be safe. No, no, um... No, seriously, I... I don“t want you to go to any trouble. No, it's no trouble. I'll be there in 20 minutes. Oh, no, Bent.. Move. What the fuck are you doing? Fucking having a break. A break? We just started. There's only one shovel. Shit. The fuck was that? Keep digging- OK. Hello? JACK". Alright? I burned down the house. Oh, well done. - I got what you wanted. - What? - Where are you? - Flandy's. OK. - What the hell happened? - I left the gas on! Are you OK? Is anyone hurt? No, I was the only one home, thank God. - Did you call the fire department? - Mm-hmm. Right away. Do you need the paramedics or anything? No. I need to find Jim. Unit Three? Unit Three. Fire at the Worth house. You got eyes on the Chief? Try the hotel. Why? Well, because I'm arresting him for the murder of Roger Crouch. Nick, he has an alibi! Yeah, I'm sure you buy it. Jury won't. You alright? Not really. Did you leave a duck in the oven? Jack, it... I got something for you. Ta-da. Christ, Jack. He's number two. - Why the woman? - Keep him chatty. Anna. Forgive me. You have to. What? What do you want? I'm sorry. Sorry? Sorry is a broken fucking cup. Not a dead kid. Kill me. It's what I deserve. You... you said it was an accident. - S0 you didn't mean it. - I still came here to kill your dad. Because of what he did to you. Do it. I don't deserve to live, Anna. D0 it. Do it. Do it! Who shot our son? She loved you. When she found out you“d been raping her on behalf of Her Majesty's Government... she tried to drink herself to death. Ended up with wet brain. You any idea what that's like, Jack, eye? Wet brain? Who pulled the trigger? S0 what did you tell yourself? That you did what you did out of duty? You blew way past duty. You're a fucking crook, same as me. You just joined a gang with uniforms. Eye? Or maybe you told yourself you were a cop with a family to feed. But that“s a lie, too, isn't it? Cos you betrayed your family like you betrayed mine. You're a fucking crook, just like the rest of us. But you do it guilt-free all cos of your pathetic little tin star. You know the only thing I regret, Jack? Is the hatred I've wasted on a low-life prick fuck like you. Where's the little fella, Frank? Don't tell him, Frank. If you talk, he“II kill you. - Do what you fucking like to me. - Stop this! - Please, please! - Just don't touch her. Don't touch... Jack. This is what you asked for, right? I know. Well, this is how it goes, love. And what about the woman and her wee boy? Kiss me. Oh, Christ. Who pulled the trigger, Frank? Who shot our boy? Two to the head, one to the heart. Jack! Jack, no. Jack! Frank, don't let him kill me! Please, please! Tell him! Who killed our son? Tell him. Fuckin' Christ, please. Fuckin' tell him! The boy. He had a favourite dog. All white. Whitey. - Whitey? - Yeah, Whitey. Anna's with him. - Chief Worth! We're going there to get Anna, not to kill Whitey. Is that clear, Jack? You're under arrest for the murder of Roger Crouch. Denise, I need immediate back up. Murder suspect is evading arrest. Jesus, what? Do not leave me to deal with this son of a bitch on my own. D0 you really have to do this now? Hey! Get your hands in the mother fucking air, you mother fuck... Fuck! Fuck! How do I look? You got a... a little mark right there. Yeah. It's a bit fucking crazy. Blowing the whistle on a company employee that you stabbed in the back? When the authorities start asking questions about a missing Security Agent they“re going to find out we went up against him. The more public we are about it now the better. This way we control the story. You are one hell of a liar. Thank you. Hey, what are you doing? What the fuck happened in Little Big Bear? What? What, Gagnon just happened to be waiting for us? My children were in danger. - I saved your life. - So what, I owe you now? You signed a statement. Now all you have to do is sit in a boardroom. That's all I gotta do? That's all you gotta do. What the hell happened? Hello. - Chief shot me. - Where? - Right over there. - No, where? Oh. Kneecap. You put your faith in him. Told you. Told you he was dirt. You wouldn't listen. I'm sorry. Just swear to God you'll nail the prick, eh? I swear. I swear I*II nail him. I love you. Do these allegations implicate North Stream itself? - That depends. - On what? There is no evidence to suggest Monsieur Gagnon had the support of the board or indeed any other employee. However, he is a company employee, protecting company interests. And not only did he murder a provincial doctor he brutalised an indigenous community that this woman is a member of. A mother. Who lost all three of her children. Her story brings a whole new spin to the headline 'Dirty Oil'. And if I publish that testimony I guarantee you every company with an ethical PR profile will drop North Stream from its supplier list. Why would you publish this? You work for us. I answer to my conscience. What do you want? When you offered me a seat at the table, you told me it was an opportunity to change the oil industry from within. Horseshit. I had as much influence over North Stream as the fucking caterers. So here“s the deal. A seat at the table? Sure. I'll take this seat. Right here. - That's the CEO's Chair. - No, it's mine. President, Human Resources, Environment Corporate Affairs. We don't have one of those. You do now. Those are the terms of my Contract. I think you'll find them reasonable. It's Mum. I've been gone all night. If I don't answer, she'II worry. Mum. Anna, are you OK? I'm fine. Is Whitey with you? Whitey? No. Um, I'm at the departure lounge. - Departure lounge? - I'm going home. - Really? - Yep. Why now? Mum, I've been wanting to go home ever since we got here. - Anna... - Plane's boarding. I'II call you when I get to Auntie Jean's. She's a fucking shit liar, ain't she? Christ, Jack, what are we gonna do? You should leave him to me. I think she's in a car. Why? You can't stay here. Steak for breakfast? Mmm. You fuckin' blackmailed the shit out of them. Keep your voice down. What if I don't? - Pardon me? - What if I... talk? Hmm? If you talk, we both get arrested. I got nothing to lose. You have your Iiberty to lose. Yeah, I would be better off in prison than going back to the rez right now. Don“t be morbid. You want me to keep my mouth shut about Gagnon you're going to pay my community for the rest of your life. Your community will be well taken care of. But if you ever threaten me again this will be the last bill I ever pay. Ask yourself what I might be prepared to do to ensure your silence. We agree we're here to save Anna, not kill Whitey. Alright, Jack? Nice one. Sorry, Jack. We could leave here, you and me. And never come back. We... we'd always be together. Fucking hell. Come here, you bastard. Where would we go? Anywhere you want. Anywhere in the whole world. That“s the point, Anna. We“re free. Do you really think we could ever get away from here? What's stopping us? Anna. Get behind me. Leave us alone. - You have no idea who he is. - I know exactly who he is. Darling girl, I'm here to help. Both of you. - Now, just do what I say. - Or what? You. Go. Leave. Run. I'm not going anywhere without Anna. You killed my little boy. My daughter's not going anywhere with you, she's coming with me. Now, you can stay here and take your chances with Jack. Or you can fuck off while you still have a chance. Anna! Whitey, you alright? You OK? Anna, don“t do this. Can you... can you walk? Anna, please. - Get out of our way. - Jack won“t let him get away. Stop him. I can't. Then I will. - You OK? Come on. - Anna? Anna! I got you. Where's your gun? Let 'em go, Jack. You're OK, come on. I've got you. Come on. You OK? I can't go on. I've got to stop. No, you can't. You've got to keep going. Come on, come on. Oh, fuck. - Oh, fuck! - Come on, come on. Come on, just get... Over there. What do we do now? I won't let him get you, OK? Jesus Christ, Anna. This is Jack Devlin. He's a fucking maniac. He's... he's still my dad. He'll kill you. Jack Devlin! Jack! - Put the gun down, Anna. - Stay back. - What's he told you? - Everything. You know she miscarried. Whitey's mum. How could you do that? How could you do that to me and mum? He killed Pete, love. He snuck into our house. Ate at our table. He lied to us, Anna. He lied to you. - Exactly what Dad did to him. - He's using you, darlinh No, he loves me. Stay back! You touch him, I'II fucking kill you. She loves me, Jack! Out you come, Simon. This“ll all be over, mate. Don't move. Stay behind me. Always go on two. Remember? Don“t fuck this up. Jack. Jack, you'll hurt her, Jack! - Five. - Jack. - Four. - Fuck! Three. Anna, Anna, Anna! I don't hate you, Jack. I love you. I've always loved you. I love you too, mate. NO! No! No! Whitey! Whitey! No, no, no. Jack! Corrected & Synced by Bakugan
