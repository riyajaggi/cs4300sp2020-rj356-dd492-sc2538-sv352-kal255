His sober birthday. - I'm two. - Oh. I'm proud of you. Come on, let's go, Pete. You're not that man anymore. - Get out of here. - Where's my gun? In your pocket. Pew! Pew! Fuck me. Shall I honk the horn? These things charge, though, right? It's not a moose, Dad. - Oi, oi, oi! Shouldn“t you have a proper car? This is a properly green community, it's one of the things I love about it. I'm growing up in the arse end of nowhere. - You sam *avse*. - She dm but she shcumwt have. Why can“t we go back to London? Cos London's shit. We'd end up living in some suburb like Hainault. Is that what you want? You want to live in Rayner's fucking Lane, do you? - You said 'fuck'. - I know I did but I shouldn“t have. In case you haven't noticed - I'm not a snowboarder. - No? I can't think of anything more pointless than hiking. And I'm not a middle-aged man who likes midge-infested rivers and fly-fishing. I don't want to squander my youth here. - 0h. - Marry a fucking Iumberjack and have kids and sell jam at the county fair. I want to be, like, a... a photojournalist. Or an archaeologist. Or... an agent for change. Fuckin' 'ell. Seems like just five minutes ago all you wanted was a tutu and pair of pink jeggings. Humour is an avoidance strategy. - Drive slowly. - Yep. And it may handle like a golf cart but it is a cop car... - Yep. - ...and you shouldn't be driving it. Do you know how many police move here from home? - Loaas. - 80'? - Se, wok around yer. - Paradise, right? - It's the most boring place on earth. It's a bit boring, in' it. - I miss my friends. - You don't have any friends. I had friends. In London. I was happy there. Well, give it a chance, love. Alright, Iet“s go. Bye.

Lady must've missed the signs but no one was attacked. - Well shouldn't we do something? - We put signs up. No, I mean, like, shoot it. We dom 'msk shoot hears, Ohm. Not unless they make an unprovoked attack. Feet - Hm? Sorry. I'II let you know if anything else happens. - Alright. - You can always go fishing. Fishing? It's what the last police chief did. He left his fishing stuff over there before he passed. You can hem yourseü. He wasn't killed by a bear, was he? No, no, he was dead from exposure by the time the bears got to him. That“s a joke, right? He's joking, right? - Yeah, he“s joking. - Council couldn't afford him. Well, I'm not going anywhere. - Ohm? - Y ep? Be careful out there, OK? Top left. Ahh! Oh no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Buggen Fuck me. Hello, I'm Angela Worth. I'm the new police chief's wife. How do you do? D'y0u fancy some burnt fudge? Or would you prefer a fist fuck? 3% Happy bmhday m you Happy birthday dear Jim 3% Happy bmhday m you t Jim. Alcoholic. Addict. Hi, Jim. Two years sober today. Fuck knows how. Um... I know I'm supposed to say something to a Higher Power but bollocks to all that. But I thank Father Greg for the cake. Suzy. So I don“t normally talk at the meetings. I'm usually hiding at the back, but here goes. What can I tell you about being a drunk? I was born frightened, I think. I grew up frightened. And drinking took the fear away. But... it also took everything else away. I didn't care about you. I didn't care about me. I didn't care about my family. I didn“t care about anything, except getting what I wanted. And 'ü you got 'm the way o? that... I'd kill you. - 00h. Thanks for trying. May v; Be my guest. Mm. This is good. It's not. It's horrible. - Butterscotch? - Fudge. Buggered fudge. English? Irish. My husband's English. Mmm. Come to check up on the colonies? SHE CHUCKLES We live here. Om - For Gods sake, dom attempt to chew. WOMAN LAUGHS How many have you sold? None. How much for the whole lot? The whole lot? It's for a good cause, isn't it? Ah, thafs... no, no, no, that's awfully kind of you but... ljust bought ten jars of apple sauce from the last stall. Fudge'II make a nice gift. You're the new police chief's wife, aren't you? If I were you, I'd want to be a sell-out success at the church fete. Sorry. Who are you? Truth is, I'm here for work and my children are across the country with their father who's an asshole, which makes it worse. So I thought maybe a whole tray of homemade *buggered' fudge might make that horrendous hotel seem less like The Shining. Why didn't you say so? Here. Knock yourself out. And a few teeth. Welcome to Little Big Bear. Elizabeth Bradshaw. - Angela. - Thank you, Angela. You're welcome. - Cheerio. - Toodle-oo. Who wants a healthier future for our children and a stronger economy? We all do - through North Stream 0il's tar sands innovation initiative. Come see how we're innovating for a cleaner future at www.carbonsafestoragacom North Stream Oil cares. You think I'm paid to say that? I am. You think I'd lie for a Iousy paycheque? I wouldn“t. As V.P. of Stakeholder Relations, I came to Little Big Bear to hear you. To hear your questions. Your hopes. Your fears. Because, ultimately, this is your town. Stop it. Your valley. And your decision. Bullshit. They started building thai damn thing months ago. North Stream Oil wants to build a refinery in the middle of nowhere because it's too big a health risk to put next to a major city. North Stream chose this site because it is the perfect nexus for oil sands petroleum into the US. And our safety standards far exceed the legal requirements. What about crime? The Chief is right. It“s happened in Fort McMurray and Grand Prairie. Migrant oil workers from all over the world, pouring into lillle lowns like ours after long, backbreaking shifts looking for somewhere to spend their cash. Well, my bar for starters. My paint's peeling and my mortgage is hurting. S0, you guys want to keep your local watering hole open... - I need more customers. They're not gonna stop at a few beers and a game of pool. Half the shops in this town are closed and the other half are struggling to stay open! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! What does me poüce smet Khink? Youwe worked mg cmes, surew you cam be womed? I'm new here. I was just concerned. Airáxd of a “me cnme, Ohm? Better at catching trout than crooks? Alright then, well, if you want my opinion, I think it“s a shit idea. If it was up to me, I'd say no. Well, it isn't. Police Chiefs job“s not to interfere in decisions like this. God dammit, you just rolled in here. YSU WEREM BOM HERE, YOU WEREM: med here. You havem got the ñgm. Me, I've got no right at all. I'm just here to protect you. But this town relies almost entirely on a modest tourist industry, doesn't it? S0 if you're so keen on protecting it, why is there a tourist in the hospital and a grizzly bear on the loose while you were out fishing all day? - Seems to me the Chief shoum be out there shooüng beats, not 'm here shooüng ms mouth oñ. SHE SIGHS How'd I do? Well, this always goes the same way. If someone won't sign over their land for company access we just build our roads on their neighb0ur's property. Then they get all the tanker noise and traffic fumes and... none of the cash. What about the rancher Lyle? Comes from an oil family. He'II know industry tactics. Then therss the doctor wRh the amp en her shoukáer and the police chief with something to prove. You're here to get a bunch of boxes ticked. Don't make things complicated. Care to fill me in? I'm taking responsible social action. Right. You've got a dead duck in a plastic bag. - They're poisoning our river! - Oh, yeah? It's 'our' river now, is it? And the only reason the principal bollocked me for bringing a dead duck into biology class is because North Stream Oil just donated money to the school. Really? Anna. Is this going to happen to us? What did Bradshaw say? She said it had probably flown through a wind farm. How do you know it didn't die of bird flu? I don't know what it died of. Yet. Pm your beh on. Fuck me. W.! Excuse me, om... Mrs...? - Bradshaw. - Mrs Bradshaw. Could you... get your truck off my road? Your road? The Municipal Districfs road. And we have full use. Oh, fair point. But, om, you know, next time what if it squashes a school bus or something? How you doing, Dan, you alright? Mm-hmm. What's all this then? Mr Lyle and I are just having a private meeting. Oh. Scooch up. Is she trying to get your signature, excuse me, on something? - Yeah? - Maybe. You got a Iawyer, mate? - Have you got a Iawyer? - I dunno. Oh, shit. This man is in no fit state to be signing any legal contracts. - What do you take me for? - I don't take you for anything, love. Who's in no fit state? - Well, Mrs... - Bradshaw. Mrs Bradshaw... is trying to get your brother to sign some sort of deal. Just leave him out of this, you understand me? Elizabeth and me, we're trying to do a little deal here. I go and take a piss, I come back here and you've crawled in. Now, what business is this of yours? Ah, I do apologise, Mr Lyle. I didn't realise that you were here. I*II be in my office. We can finish our deal there. Alright. You can buy yoursew a dm track but you can't stop me from closing our road to your traffic if it presents a health and safety risk to the residents of this town and their kids. Elizabeth. You may well have a personal opinion about our use of the road but you're powerless to stop it. Oh, we'll see about that, won't we? The police chief just knocked $25,000 off the deal we offered you. Oi. Don“t forget your duck. What was all that about? I took some socially responsible action. - God! - Jesus fuck! Get your hands in the air now! Get your hands in the air, Lyle. Now. OK, put the gun... What? - Put the gun away. - If you don't arrest him no one*s gonna respect your authority here. I'm British, Denise. We don't do guns. Put the gun away. Dad... Put the gun away. Put the gun away. I think you and I, we need to have a quiet little talk. - Are you going to arrest me? - Do I need to? - Up your ass, you fat Limey. - Oh, knock it off, Danny. Really? - Jesus. - Om! Oh, fuck! Here we go, here we go, here we go. Go on, you're on the Sidewalk. You can't lie on the sidewalk. Alright. Just leave us alone, will ya? 0h, Christ, you're not gonna puke, are ya? Go on, Danny. Nothing to see here. - Have you got a tissue, love? - Yeah. Now, oil workers from Britain to British Columbia are gonna start pouring into that facility and all of them looking for the nearest town to get fucked up in. And the nearest town is... Sorry. How can I help you? How can I... help you? I'm not following this at all. Follow this. I'm, er, Head of Security and our workers are gonna be subject to a zero tolerance policy on drugs, alcohol, gambling, prostitution and violence. Believe me, we're... we're watching them. But the reality is we're counting on your cooperation to make sure things go smoothly. Smoothly for who? Your only hope of keeping law and order is to cooperate fully with North Stream Oil. That's why we pay you. You don't pay me. The council pays me. With our money. You know this, this shit-heel town couldn't afford a... a police chief without us. Door! North Stream has blood on its hands. I've been up North. Seen what they've done. Well, you think getting pissed is going to help? I filed a report. Submitted it to the Federal Health Department and within three months half a dozen so-called colleagues have signed a document discrediting me. I'm ruined. Can I make you a coffee? I'm Scared. I'm really, really scared. Can you stay with me? Jesus, Suzy. They're following me. Who is? Just dom have me. OK? We should go see your kids. I'II get Father Greg, too, alright? Come round and take you to a meeting. I don't need a fucking meeting. I don“t need a meeting. Just go. Just fucking go. Go. Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls! Here we go! - Five... iour... - (tfmon, w s stamng! Three... two... ene... Send 'em down! Which duck is gonna lead? And it looks like a pretty tight race to me. Neck and neck at the start. It says here you poked him in the eye. I tried to talk to him. And then kicked him in the balls. It was just a tap, love. His brother Iaunched a complaint with the council. Use of undue force. Think you're gonna get a warning. Jesus, Jim. No wonder everybody's staring at us. Is there anything else you want to tell me about? The Tribal Elders are pissed. Why, what's he done now? You know the casino at the edge of town? Yeah, the one they built on the reservation. It's not a reservation, love. It“s a reserve. Reservation is American, apparently. Anyways, my father borrowed a lot of money to get that built. So? You need the refinery to get people into the casino. If you're against the refinery, you're against the casino. I thought people loved the police in Canada. Yeah, till you got here, evidently. We came here to get away from the wreckage, not make more of it. We agreed. Peace. Unit One, tn/'s is Unit Three. Came in. We got a 10-38 on Moose Mountain, I'm British, Nick, I'm not up on the 10 Codes. - Can I have it in English? - Just get here, Chief, Quick. Right. Did you touch anything? Where do elves live? In the woods. How come I never see them? They only come out at night. - Are you OK? - Mm-hm. If she was planning to top herself she wouldn't have done it after a glass of fucking Rioja. And she'd have told me. She trusted me. You know how many alcoholics commit suicide? No note. No call. She just drives into a Iay-by and blows her brains out? I don't buy it. AII I know is that Suzy was going after North Stream. And after that she was blacklisted. There's something. Hello. What if she didn't kill herself? The coroner agreed it was a suicide. I don't know. Something's not right here. You ever worked homicide? Ewas. I'II go, love. It's five in the morning, mate. - There's a monster! - Alright. What's going on? There's someone outside. - What? - Get dressed. Get dressed. How soon can you get here? 20 minutes. Something wrong, Chief? As soon as you can, then. Fuck. - 0h, Jesus, Jim. - Come on. Fuck! Dad. - I'll do him up. - Good girl. Right, this is what we are gonna do, alright? I'm gonna start the car, I'm gonna put the door up and we're gonna drive right out, straight out. I want you to duck down, alright, tuck right down - and stay like this. - Get down. Alright, see you do it? That's it. Oh, Jesus, I told you to fix that thing! Sm down, stay down. Let's go. Where are we going? Calgary- What just happened, Jim? I don't know, love. - Everything okay, Chief? - Yeah. Be a sniper's bullet in the, er, front room. Found it. Also broken window, ground floor. Fxre damage Ko the downstáxrs bamvoøm. We contained it. And an empty briefcase on the porch. Nick“s checking the perimeter now. Good. Oh. fuck. You stay in the car. I need a wee-wee. Can you hold it? Petey, I don't think there“s a Ioo here. - I'm going to pee in my pants! - Dad, Petey needs the Ioo. Not now love, alright? I need a wee-wee. - Not now, pal, I'm sorry. - He's five years old. 30 seconds for a piss behind the car. I need a wee-wee! - I said no! - Dad. I'm going to pee in my pants! Dad! He was only five.
