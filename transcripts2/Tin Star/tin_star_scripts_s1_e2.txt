Lived here a!! my life. It's my home. And I'm proud to be a part of it. My grandfather was from the old country came over on a steamer and setup near Big Bear, Log shanty, horse and cart, hand-dubbed water well. He worked the woods and his friends worked with him. Making a home. Raising a family. Building a future. Guess you could can him a pioneer. That was then. And times have changed. I've got my own family now. But I got a whole new bunch of friends. And we 'd like you to join us making a home. Building a future, North Stream Oil. Welcome to the new frontier. Can I get you anything? What? Xanax? Diazepam? Oh, no, thanks. If you change your mind. Chief Worth? Inspector Benoit Lehane, H.C.F.P. How do you do. I bring personal condolences from the commissioner and the assistant commissioner. I bring the sympathy of H section in Montreal and of the entire Royal Canadian Federal Police. Right, and I bring some shitty coffee. Thanks. I want a constable parked outside this door. Done. And your daughter? No, she's with me. I know that nothing I can say or do is gonna bring your boy back. To that extent I am useless impingement on your grief. But I can tell you this. - Justice will be done. - Right. - What you doing here? - Chief, we're so sorry. Did you close the road? First thing you should have done was close the road. No, Chief, we can't just close the road. Not without the consent of the District. Shouldn't the Feds be handling this? - They are. - They are? Yeah, they are. OK, so what should we be doing? Closing the fucking road. Why? S0 no one gets in or out. I'm not manning a roadb/ock We got a homicide to work. I'm getting auxiliary volunteers. It'll take an army reserve uni! To stop North Stream OH bringing guys in. Just don 't let anyone out. Do they know who did this? Local Police Service. What? They did not have the authority to close a road. No, I mean, do they know who killed the boy? No. Now, I can bus in workers in from this side of the road closure but I cannot get equipment through. Monsieur Gagnon. A child has just been murdered. I'm well aware of that. But the fact remains no truck, no equipment... no refinery. Tss. From the moment you step off of our courtesy shuffle your every need is cared for. Fuck me. You'll lodge ln North Stream Oil 's brand new Staff Village where it's easy to make yourself at home. Award-winning cuisine from every corner of the globe. And best of all you're doing a job you can be proud of. I want to go home. Home? Yeah, to London. Mum can't be moved yet, love, I'm a parent, but I can't begin to imagine what you are feeling. If there's anything I can do, anything at all... How is Mrs Worth? In a coma. I heard her chances of full recovery were improved by the new facilities at Little Big Bear Hospital. Come again? I hear her chances for a full recovery were improved by the new facilities at Little Big Bear Hospital. Oh, I get it. Facilities your staff paid for by North Stream Oil. 'Because we care, ' right? - We do. - But you got a job to do and you're here to make a deal. I'm here to offer you our full support in the investigation of this... You want the road open so you can finish your refinery. That's not my priority. We got off to a bad start. Heated words were exchanged. I'm here to extend an olive branch. Go on, then. A reward. For information leading to the capture of the killers of your son. Fuck off. I'm sorry you feel that way. You should be. No prints. Hollow point bullet was shredded so no match to a weapon. No shells were found. Striation on the sniper“s bullet in the window frame came back insufficient. Feds are taking a look at the briefcase. What do you know about... Suzy Bouchard? She did a lot for my community. My father trusted her. I trusted her. So is... do you think there could be something to this North Stream business, huh? The woman I knew only spoke the truth. You got anything for nerves? Xanax. Top drawer, just the left side. You two an item? Us? No. Really? NO. Why? So, this Conversation is... this is between us? It stops with us? I ducked. When the gunman went to pull the trigger. I didn't even think about it, I just... ducked. And the bullet, it went over my head and into my son. Ducking was a natural reflex. But, if I hadn't done it, he'd still be alive, right? From ten feet? Chances are you would both be dead. - Chief. - Thanks. If you wanna go to London you can always stay with your Auntie Jean. I'm not going on my own. We all go or we all stay. Well, then If you stay, you stay within my sight 24/7. Peas in a pod. Peas in a pod. You wait here, alright, love? Won“t be long. Keep an eye on her. Don't let her out of your sight. Copy that. You've had enough. - He's close. - Who is? I've had enough of this. Where d'y0u think you're going? Huh? We stay put. Finish what we started. Stay put, yeah? Fuck you. Keep calm. Stop telling me to keep calm. Because we're accessories... - Will you please keep your voices down! - ...to the murder of a five year-old boy whose daddy happens to be the fucking filth. - Hey, shut him up, Frank. - OK. - Can I help you? - Just wanna look around. You got a warrant? Place of work. Don't need one. You need a reason. Murder investigation? Dr Susan Bouchard? This an interview? - Why, you want a Iawyer? - Chief Worth. We'd be more than happy to help. So, just a couple of questions about the suspected murder of Dr Bouchard. - Dr Bouchard? - Dr Susan Bouchard. She compiled, er, some sort of medical report shortly before she was murdered. Re North Stream. Would you care to comment about that? I have no knowledge of any report. Your company ruined her life, apparently. Er, some sort of blacklist. She was terrified about what you might do next. What? - I wouldn't be able to comment on that. - Why not? There must be a tonne of Iawyers in this place. Oh, don't worry. I can wait. Yeah, OK. You've had enough. Just put it down. You've had enough, mate. Oy! _ Sorry, Asshole! I'II buy you another one, alright. What was it, a shandy? You big fucking poof! - Hey, hey, hey! - What d*y0u say? Leave it. Who the fuck are you? Walk away. Shit. Uh...
