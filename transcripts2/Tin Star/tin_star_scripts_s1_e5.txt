I see motorcycle tracks, so I was wondering if bikers had a hand in this. When we make the arrests, I'm sure your company will be informed. Absolutely. If you wouldn't mind, do you have a manifest for the payload? It was probably in the driver's cab. It would be a big help to know what was... stolen. Mm-hmm. Asshole. I was sorry to hear about your colleague. "Angie" by Bert Jansch Idiot! I never barred a police chief before, but after last night, maybe I should. You know, bikers might be trouble. At least they“re trouble I can handle. - Put something in it. - Go home, Chief. Sleep it off. What if I don't? You gonna call the cops? Oi, whiskey. What are you, a cowboy now?

Don't normally allow customers back here. So what are you clearing a week here, then? Two things I never discuss with Strangers. - The first is money. - Alright, let me guess. Take off wages, utilities, stock, taxes, Iicence, mortgage... I'd say, what, two grand a week tops? I mean, look at you. A woman of your grace and stature shouldn't be lugging crates around. You know y0u'd make ten times what you're making now with a late Iicence and a bit of adult entertainment. - What? What? What kind of adult entertainment did you have in mind? Cold beer, warm women. Nothing too tasteful. I ain't looking for a partner. What about a backer, then? A backer? Yeah. You know, you out front. Me right behind you. What exactly do you bring to the table? Hundred grand. Once I Iiquidize my assets. A strip bar, eh? One stage, two poles, six girls in a rota. $20 on the door and a premium on all drinks. You put the boom back in boom town. I'm telling you, love. You'd make a killing off these oil boys. AII those paycheques and nowhere else to spend them but your bar. What kind of a girl do you take me for? I take you for a very capable woman.
