 Yet you don't say what we all think about. I think this is hardly the right time. We don't know what awaits you when you get home. We have the situation under control. How so? - The city guard is reinforced. - The thieves are still raging. If the lieutenant colonel has information he can be safely give it to Dĺĺdh... Leave it to your subordinates. - People are afraid. - Is it funny, Mrs. Ehrenpreis? - Mother didn't mean... - Quiet, boy! What people are you talking about, Colonel? I know no one from the lower ranks who's been affected. Possibly it may be the more you have, the more cowardly you become. Let's not talk anymore about that.

 My God, some small burglaries... You're better if someone died. No, more wine! Freund, the children don't wear you out? The lesson is over. I'm waiting for Dĺĺdh. It is wise; you shouldn't walk alone in the dark. - Freund. - Dĺĺdh. Mrs. Wĺhlstedt, thanks for a delicious dinner. - Fredrika. - Magdalena. - See you tomorrow. - You got that right in. Can the Commissar join us? You are course, interested in animal magnetism. Cagliostori will demonstrate it to the lieutenant colonel. I am interested. What time? - Fredrik? - Mrs. Ehrenpreis? Mother? I'll go to the house in the country. Now! - Excuse me, my mother is so unpredictable. - I'm glad you wanted to come. - How does it look? - He just took what was valuable. Did anyone else know where you stored valuables? Someone's maid? You never told anyone? No. - Not even in confidence? - No. Can your father have said anything? It's obvious you didn't know him. The only people who knew, were father and I. I swear. Driver, stop! - Where are we headed? - To your country house. Madame, how are you? Drive me home. - Yes, but... - I want to go to my house. - But you... - What don't you understand? Of course, ma'am. Just drop it. Drunkard! What? Is it difficult to be you? No gentleman for a frivolous life? You interact with the patriots; the sins of the French woman; - Harbouring impure thoughts about married women. Show some dignity. - Does Sir want a bed time snack? - No thanks. Can you describe what the thief looked like? I could barely see the man. - My mother needs rest. - Adolf, leave off. You probably remember something. How tall was he? In height. He was much taller than me, and large. - Thick? - No, just large. - Strong? - Yes. And the face? - Must you torment my mother? Adolf, that's enough now! I'm not going to speak up again. - Has the district commissar children? - No. - You underestimate happiness. - Did he wear a mask? - Yes. - Nordin... - Black? - Yes, it was enough. Nordin, go see if something is missing in the other rooms. Now I think about it, he definitely wore a black mask. Dĺĺdh, we need to talk to Wĺhlstedt. We have a description. A heavy man in a black mask. - Is she safe? - Yes. He's back. The burglaries occurred in two different ways. Who's back? Didriksson. Who's Didriksson? - It must be five years ago? - Yes. Povel Didriksson was my first event manager. And he was a burglar? - He was ruthless. He eluded us for months. In the end we managed to identify him on Platskans. What happened? I lost three men that night. And no one's seen him since. - How did you know he was right there? - He was in love with Louise. No... Lovisa. - I'll tear the truth out of her. - Nordin, I'll do it. - I know her. - It'll be all over Stockholm. Has the gentleman any requests, or does he want to improvise? I have a special request Information. Things you don't know, harm no one. Information is dangerous. Information about Didriksson. Sir can go now. When any city guard feels horny he comes and asks about Didriksson. - I'm not for free. - What do you charge? A shilling an hour? Is Didriksson back? - In the city? - Yes. Have you seen him? I'll ensure he doesn't harm you. I'm not afraid of Povel. He'd never hurt me. He loved me. He wanted to marry me. A whore. Have you heard anything so preposterous? Has he tried to contact you? He hasn't come back. If he was here, I'd know. We won't eat at home tonight. Freund? - Freund, I'm talking to you. - I'm listening. We won't eat at home tonight so let the poor have the pike. I can't attend the lieutenant colonel's event- - So you must go there and offer my apologies. To Wĺhlstedt's wife? To Mrs. Ehrenpreis and the lieutenant colonel who invited me. - An event? - A scientific demonstration. As the district commissar pleases. You will patrol in pairs. Each pair is responsible for a section. Only at the sound of a whistle can you leave your section. And only if you need immediate help, blow on your pipe. - Is that clear? - Yes! We all know who Didriksson is. We all know what he's capable of. What are we waiting for? Now we'll take that bastard! It seems we'll patrol together. I can take that there. No thank you. We'll be involved something amazing. You don't understand anything, you just fill with something pleasant and float away. It... Freund! This is Simon Freund, tutor and orderly. Mrs. Ehrenpreis and Mrs. Wĺhlstedt. Commissar Dĺĺdh can't attend. - What's he doing then? - Working, of course. Are you close to capturing Didriksson? - Not a word crossed my lips. - Carl Fredrik, you can talk to me. I don't doubt for one second. Dĺĺdh is a resourceful fellow. He's handsome. Ladies and gentlemen, the show can begin. Curtain! My ladies and gentlemen, what you'll witness is a show- -In necromancy's dark arts. Spirits will speak through your mouths. These spirits will tell you the universe's innermost secrets. May I ask for a volunteer? Use me. Mademoiselle Hanehjelm. Here you are. Is there anything particular you want? - I want to talk to my father. - You want to talk to your dead father. Sebarog. Are you going on patrol in the morning? What is it? There! I'm ready. What do you see? Figures. Unclear. They move in a white light. Do you see your father? Let... the spirits... come. "Sadai Tetragrammaton. Eloha Jerhatel! Yog Sothoth." Murderers! May you rot in hell! May your soul wither away! Sir, doesn't the demonstration please you? No, sir. You're a charlatan. You don't fool me. Does the gentleman dare come up and rebut me, or is he too cowardly for that? Bow to me. Deeper, you disgusting scum. Deeper, I said! As my rank requires. Is my wig powdered? - But do something about it, then. - Then I ask your Excellency to ignore. - I slipped some on my powder puff. - Give me my stick. I'll chastise you. Carl Fredrik, do something. Maybe it's enough now. So this was a small demonstration. If you want, don't hesitate to report your interest at a private visit. No! Freund! - Freund, come in here! - To do what, sir? - I must get at the wound. - Take off the uniform. It's just a flesh wound. Get a needle, thread and all the linen you can find. Drink. A piece of wood. Bite. Something else? This will hurt. Ouch! Stop it! Then. Another. It will heal, but you must be sure to keep quiet. I just want to know something. Did you know what you sent me to? - I'm tired. - You sent me to a magnetist. - A devil-worshiper. - Magnetists are scientists. After everything I've done... Have you so little respect for me? Mr. Dĺĺdh... It hurts me how you treat the ones you love. I apologize. Can you wake Mrs. Ehrenpreis? You've succeeded on your own. Step inside, the heat's escaping. Close the door. Can you describe the mask again? - Is it really necessary? - I need to confirm something. - Was it like a carnival mask? - Yes. With narrow eye slits surrounded by a thin red line? - Yes, that was it. - A half-mask? Precisely. Was there anything more? - Was it a mask? - Yes, I told you. With all respect, Madam, you only imagine it. Who robbed you? - I can't say. - Your son. What are you saying, man? He uses opium, right? I've seen that look often during my time in Paris. An expensive habit. And it's dangerous for the soul. Adolf is an incompetent, but he's not evil. He struck you. He didn't, certainly not, I fell when I tried to stop him. He is my son. I don't see want to see him on the scaffold. Let's take it from the beginning. Did he wear a mask when he robbed you? - No. -Then your son isn't the man we're hunting. I'd appreciate if Mr. Wĺhlstedt didn't know about this here. Adolf will surely inherit from me. Sooner or later. If you don't return everything you stole I'll personally ensure you get locked up the rest of your life. I stole nothing. There was nothing to steal, the thief had already been there. You had him. You had Didriksson in the alley, and you let him go. What were you thinking? "Forgive me, Didriksson. Please, go ahead, after you." And then this with Nordin's man. I didn't think it'd be difficult for Dĺĺdh to take a man. Dĺĺdh! I've nothing to say. There's been a burglary. Does this ever end? That someone could do this. Audaciousness... While I was sleeping. And you heard anything? Tell the Honourable Chief Constable, the king will hear about this. We can't do more here. Now it's up to the district commissar to proceed. Excuse me a moment. Mr. Dĺĺdh? - I regret the burglary. - They haven't destroyed anything in here. Thank God. Given what happened to dear Hanehjelm... Did you know him? Only his daughter. "Cagliostori", is that Italian? Much needs to be done with this kind of occurrence. Have you found any clues? Not yet, I'm afraid. What is it that disturbs you, Dĺĺdh? I have all the facts on the ground, but nothing is true. Would you like to have that treatment? Now? - No, I can't ask for that. - It may help you to see clearly. If we can do anything to capture the beast, we'll be more than happy. For your own safety. Hold these. Relax. Your body feels light as a feather. You're no longer here. You float in the air... No... What's this? Nordin, what are you doing? What are you doing? Ouch! - It can't be right. Not Dĺĺdh. - We caught him in the act. When we got there we found the whore dead. A sword lay beside the corpse. - How important is a speedy solution? It's essential. I mean... At any price? Are we talking of torture? Nordin... - Mrs. Wĺhlstedt. - What are you doing here? Nordin is here on business. Does it mean you've found Didriksson? He can count himself lucky about the king's edict against torture. Really, "Ma Chérie". Good. Then I'll leave you in peace. Should I interpret your wife's words as an order? I only take orders from the king. Freund. Mrs. Wĺhlstedt, the lesson is over. Nordin has arrested Dĺĺdh. - For what? - Murder. You must have misunderstood. Nordin is here. They're talking about it now. Your husband knows Dĺĺdh. He wouldn't... Mrs. Wĺhlstedt. Mrs. Wĺhlstedt. Well ...Do you stand fast to your horrible statement? I have told you a hundred times... Silfverblad is behind it all. - Who bound him? Is that you? - Yes, Mr Nordin. Idiot! Hell, they're too loose. Tighten them! Tighten! Nordin... Tighter. - Nordin... -The lieutenant colonel is a decorated member of the army. You're trying to drag his name through the mud. I didn't killed Lovisa. Tighten. - I didn't killed Lovisa. - Tighten. But what the hell! You can't seriously believe Dĺĺdh's guilty. I'm not going to discuss things you can't possibly understand. I don't want to be disturbed this evening. You have a visitor, Mr. Dĺĺdh. You shouldn't be here. Nor you either. - You must go from here. - What have they done to you? What's happened? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. What is it I wouldn't believe? Didriksson and Silfverblad are the same person. He did this. He murdered Lovisa. I promised to protect her. You don't believe me. I believe you. Dĺĺdh... I believe you. Magnetist is the devil. Dĺĺdh said we shouldn't do anything. Mrs. Wĺhlstedt! Mrs. Wĺhlstedt, with all respect, we can't let him rot in the cell. If you'll excuse me, Mr. Freund, you weren't tempted last time we talked. I was a little shaken up. I hope I didn't appear ungrateful. - It's a generous offer. - The first time was hard to accept. The lack of control is unpleasant- - But when you get past that there's no limit. That's right. I feel sad. I hope you can help me with it. Won't we help the tutor? Of course, we'll help him. Keep these in each hand. Relax. Your body feels as light as a feather. You float in the air. You are no longer here. What happened? Good evening, beautiful mask. Didriksson. This is a solemn moment. Mr. Wĺhlstedt, listen. You've been deceived. Didriksson and Silfverblad are the same person. Silfverblad is behind everything! You have to understand that. Dĺĺdh, Silfverblad is a nobleman who is very close to the king. Didriksson is currently locked up there. He was arrested for the murder of Hanehjelm. Didriksson? Let me talk to him. How the hell can you believe we'd take orders from a murderer? Give me a chance, I ask you. Haven't I been right before? One chance. Do you want to end up on the scaffold? How long will the spectacle last? I can get answers in exchange for amnesty. Out of the question! He killed three of my men. Should we reward criminals? For an amnesty, he'd implicate the king! No amnesty. You'll get a chance, when I stop this. - Who are you working for? - Myself. I work alone. - How did you know when the houses were empty? -Lucky, I guess. Listen to me. I don't care about the burglaries, Lovisa trusted you. You exploited her feelings. You... - What are you talking about? - She's dead. You wanted to protect her by keeping away. He killed her; and you still protect him. I'll cut Silfverblad's throat. I'll cut Silfverblad's throat! What's this? What? Don't you know who I am? I won't say anything. You don't dare. I already know how everything went. - The silver, where did your father put it? - In a hidden safe behind a painting. - Will your house be empty on Wednesday? - Father and I'll go to the theatre. Your client was voluble, but Mrs. Ehrenpreis was difficult. - Are you going to the country this weekend? -Yes. If it isn't Kristina's birthday. She'll have an event. - Will you go to the country? - I can't wait. Next weekend I'll definitely go. Unless Magdalena has an event. You finally got her where you wanted... And finally you magnetized the wrong person. It will be empty. The Wĺhlstedt's will be at the opera, and the children are in the country. But why did you kill Lovisa? Why didn't you kill me? We'd have, if I were allowed to decide. There is someone else. There is someone above you. Who? Who is ...? - Where are the stolen goods? - I'll say nothing. You will, there's time enough. Freund... How did you fool Cagliostori? It wasn't me. It was the Lord. "Is Our God A Mighty Fortress, He is our shield and sword" - It was the Lord. - Your faith saved me. It was the Lord. I still don't understand completely. Why didn't Silfverblad kill you? Why endeavour to get you convicted? Why humiliate you? - You said it. - What? Let me in. Let me in now. - District commissar. - Why did you kill Lovisa? Straight on. Some things don't change, but other... - I believe in the revolution. - It doesn't believe in you. Why do you think I had something to do with ...? Lovisa was her name? I know you tried to incriminate me for murder and humiliate me in public. You don't want a better world. You want to burn it down. From the ashes, the new world will be born. Delivered by a midwife who kills. Either assist revolution or repression. - She helped me! - Who do you think you are? You can't arrest me, I'm an aristocrat. - It was Silfverblad, too. - You have no proof. - Silfverblad may give me proof. - Silfverblad is a true patriot. - Stolen goods? - They're already sold. The King's lapdogs pay for their own destruction. You forget Cagliostori. Do you think you can trust him? No one can trust Cagliostori. That's the beauty of the man. As a shepherdess, formal dress At the source of a June day Hope are from grass rosy bed its ornamental and small pleasure Wonderful. - Look, here is our hero. - I won't stay. Mrs. Ehrenpreis, I regret we haven't found the stolen goods. I see. If you don't mind I want to talk with Mrs. Wĺhlstedt. Of course. In recent days I've realized who are my friends. I count you as a friend. A dear friend. I can't be your friend. No, I know. I just wanted to... Good. I am pleased you see clearly. I am pleased to have such friends. Be sure to earn them. Don't give up your ideals. Don't let your honour. I won't let you down. Watch over the others and yourself. We must always be vigilant? It's an awesome night out there. The darkness and cold penetrate so easily. It darkens the hearts of men. Go out there and light a fire.
