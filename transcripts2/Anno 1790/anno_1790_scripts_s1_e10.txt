 What has Dr. Holmberg prescribed other than bloodletting and leaching? Cupping- Three cures of the same kind. Dr Holmberg has been the family and my husband's doctor for many years. I see no reason not to follow his orders. Freund is still missing. Nobody knows his whereabouts. Do you have nothing stronger than water? What do you want from me? What have I done? I heard the Coachman returned last night.

 Good morning. Dĺĺdh. That is correct. He has turned up. And Freund? - Sit down. - Where is Freund? The police chiefs carriage was attacked yesterday afternoon. The robbers drove off with the carriage. - Unfortunately Freund was still inside it. - And where's the driver now? He's already been questioned. Please sit. - I demand to question him myself! - Sit down! Where did the attack take place? North of Rota-bro inn. The driver reports two people on horseback. Both masked and armed. Just two?

 Who attacks the police chiefs carriage with just two people? I was wondering the same thing. What's more, the driver also claims that one of the robbers was a woman. Which I seriously doubt. He was slightly muddled during questioning. Dĺĺdh? Dĺĺdh! I am the acting Chief of Police! Have you finished? Show me... Beautiful work, Rosina. Toll inspector Lejon will be delighted. I was up the whole night finishing it. It cost me three candles. I have something to show you. Our next job. I've never seen such beautiful cloth. I bought it from a ship's purser who'd brought it back from China. I got it cheap. He was broke and came here with the cloth himself. - Poseidon? - Yes? You are being careful. I hope. Do a humble ship's purser and I have the same right to trade in Chinese goods as the rich? - Yes... - Well, then. I have right on my side. And that right I must assert. What are you doing here? Some fresh oxygen is needed in here. Dr Holmberg was just here. He said nothing of that... Your husband is getting no better. Lady Wahlstedt. If we do not lower his fever. He might not survive the night. Grind this for me. As finely as pepper. What is this? Cinchona. And a bottle of red wine. Any news on Freund? All I know is that the robbers were after neither the police chiefs carriage nor Freund. It wasn't Freund they wanted. It was me. Give him a quarter measure of powder. Mixed with wine. Every other hour. Throughout the night. If you know all this. Why do you not have them arrested? Their rooms were... abandoned and emptied. They are likely to have already fled the city. Magdalena... Carl-Fredrik...l Wait here. Don't move. I am grateful for your insistence. I came to ask if you have any more of that... Cinchona. Exactly. We have run out. Is it a bark? It comes from the Cinchona tree. I learnt to use it when I was in the war. A surgeon-in-chief had brought it home from one of his long journeys. - It is very effective against fever. - Fantastic. I am to give this to Mr Dĺĺdh. Who did you get this from? - A man. - Who? Who gave you this? Who? What did he look like? - Answer! Who... - What are you doing? What is going on? They have Freund. Look around. Do you see him? What did he look like? Was he tall? Short? He had a mark on his hand. - A mark? What kind of mark? - A fork. A fork? Where? Where? On his hand. Where on his hand? Here? - Good. - What are you going to do? Go there. Alone? It is what they demand. Have you come for the butter barrels? Nordin. Have you seen? The Chief of Police is better. Yes. I can see that. My prayers have clearly been answered. Thank you. Johanna... Prepare a bath for me, will you? A new wig. I see. What is that you have? The weekly report. Where is everyone? Where is my wife? The children? Are they with Freund? I am afraid that something very serious has happened. Concerning Freund... You're up? There you are! Sit down. Do not tire yourself now. Nordin was about to tell me something about Freund... You have not heard yet. Freund is missing. He has been taken. - As has your carriage, sir. - I beg your pardon? And Dĺĺdh? Where is he? He's gone to get Freund. Dĺĺdh has received word, of Freund. From whom? Carl-August. Go to the kitchen with Johanna and she'll make you a nice cup of hot chocolate. Dĺĺdh has gone to meet the ones who have Freund. Who are they? Could one of you be so kind as to explain... Meet them where? Dĺĺdh received a letter demanding that he ride out to a certain place. Alone and unarmed. Which he has also done. Alone? They could take him too! His best friend is in another's power. If he does not obey their instructions. Freund's life will be in danger. - As will his. - It is anyway. - What do you care? - Madam! That's enough! We all hope for Dĺĺdh's best. Is that not so Nordin? Of course. I apologise for keeping you waiting in the cold. - Where is Freund? - Your journey is ended. Dĺĺdh. - Do you see that? - I have come. Unarmed as requested... Do you see that? - What do you want from me? - Your life. In exchange for Freund's. You killed my brother. I have money now. Men. Weapons. Enough for us to continue the struggle for the liberty Erik once dreamed of creating. A new regime. Turn around. If I am to die, at least let me know that Freund lives. Turn around. Fire! Mauritz, home safe and sound from across the seas! You must have many stories. Indeed, my dear brother. But first to business. As you know, a while ago. The Order of Freemasons' highest patron. Duke Karl. Permitted me to open a lodge. Named after my late wife, Theresia. At our latest meeting we voted to have you admitted as a Freemason. I am overwhelmed. Beside myself with pride... and accept with... with the utmost delight. A small personal gift from my travels to China. As a memory of this event. Which is a happy one for the both of us. It is too much. Too much! I do not know how to... Do not get too excited. You are not yet fully recovered! But I love presents! Mon frčre... Élégance! A successful hunt. I see. We have both rebels. One dead and one living. - And Freund? - I am afraid there is no trace of him. But your carriage has at least been retrieved, sir. It was about to end very badly... See that they release me. If you wish to see Freund again. I intend to find him myself anyway. He will not last for much longer. Not where he is now. But the driver you set free. He is a simple man with a large family. It is me you wanted, not Freund. He has nothing to do with this. It was a mistake of you to have Nordin ambush us. I did not tell Nordin of your message. No? Has he gained the gift of sight? You have much blood on your hands since changing sides. First, my brother's. Now Pontus's. And soon Freund's. How do I even know Freund's alive? You must believe me. You have no choice. Otherwise he dies. No Freund. I understand. No. I assume that you will both do your utmost to find him. Where is Freund? I told you. You will not see him alive again. I am sure we will get it out of you. Tell me. Tell me! He was found in the well. - Do you know who he is? - The cooper, they say. Poseidon. Poseidon Blomberg. A cooper? Why all the silk cloth around a humble cooper? Is that it? Is it him? Is it the fork? Take him to the deadhouse. Dĺĺdh rides obediently to you when you summon him. Why? And he allows you to make demands. Tell me, how well do you two know each other? Who are you? Please don't shoot! Where ": Freund? Where": Freund? I know of no Freund! I know of no Freund! Please don't shoot me! My husband died in the war. He never got to see her. When did you last see your brother alive? It was a few days ago. I'd just sewn a silk waistcoat that toll inspector Lejon had ordered. - This one? - Yes. - You're a seamstress? - Yes. And Poseidon traded in silk cloth. Which he obtained from where? He bought them off fellow sailors he once sailed with in years past. He kept his silk in some barrels in a comer, but now it's all been stolen. What will become of me now? Your brother. Poseidon. He sent me a note proving his part in the kidnapping of a friend of mine called Freund. How come? I don't know. Some time ago I saw him with some people I'd not seen before. - Who? - I went to collect some cloth and caught him with two other people. A man and a woman. They were sitting at a table and looked very troubled by my sudden appearance. Who do you think killed your brother? He had his enemies. Wholesalers who thought he competed unfairly with overly low prices. What is this? His correspondence. Poseidon had always been critical of the monarchy. I was going to burn it. And this, what's this? We sewed that into every garment we managed to sell. Along with the client's name. Why? Because we knew that our customers would never dare say where they bought such items of clothing. I recognise this. That lake. I've been there. There's the field... He must be nearby. "Cave au nord". I don't speak French. "Cellar to the north". Freund? Freund? Freund! Freund! Forgive me. Forgive me. Freund? We have much to celebrate. Dĺĺdh! My recovery. Freud's return... and my forthcoming admission into the Theresia Freemason lodge. - As I have been informed. - Then we shall meet this evening! I think I've found a motive... for the murder of the cooper. I was thinking about the way he was shrouded in such expensive silk. Who would waste such cloth? On someone who'd already been strangled? And then toss it in a well? Someone who clearly did not know its value. Or perhaps someone who knew exactly what it was worth. Who wanted to send a signal and make an example of Poseidon. I did some researches. Poseidon served on the Terra Nova on a voyage to Macao and Sumatra six years ago. I checked the crew lists and the trade lists... Dĺĺdh. Dĺĺdh... But it raises questions. Not for me. Désolé. One question. Dĺĺdh... Do you find this wig sufficiently elegant? For a Freemason. More than sufficient. You may continue your investigations. Provided you do so most efficiently. Adieu. I haven't seen Dĺĺdh in a while. I daresay he's at home with his friend. - Freund? - Yes. He was found yesterday evening. Get Nordin. Did you not hear me? Get Nordin! Freund. I have to leave again soon. Where to? To the Wahlstedts". For dinner. To celebrate his recovery. An East India supercargo by the name of Christensen will also be there. I have some questions to ask him. I think he was involved in the murder. The murder of the cooper. You look a little better. I feel tired. Weak. I have backache. I feel sick in my chest. I have swollen feet, toothache. Dizziness. Stitch. Dĺĺdh... I should like to thank you... and God in his Heaven for rescuing me. No. Rosina Blomberg rescued you. And she lives on Gaffelgränd above the bakery. Without that map you would never have survived. - And that was thanks to her. - What map? It's a long story. Can I get you anything before I leave? Thank you. Dĺĺdh... Freezing. Anything else, or may I go now? Thank you. Dĺĺdh... Have a nice evening. The person whom I should most like to thank for my miraculous recovery... is my District Commissioner who with his exotic concoctions and medical abilities managed to postpone my meeting with my Maker. Your health. And my thanks. I should also like to thank my dear friend Mauritz Christensen... first supercargo for the East India Company and his two charming daughters... for doing us the honour of visiting our humble abode. And I take this opportunity to welcome you home after yet another successful voyage across the East Indian seas. Thank you very much. Mauritz has had unparalleled success in his trade with China. Especially in silk. As I understand. Tell me, sir... do you know a man named Poseidon? Poseidon Blomberg. No. Should I? He was cooper on the East Indiaman Terra Nova from 1784 to 86. He also traded in silk. But on a small scale. You also sailed on that ship. The Terra Nova, no? But then as the second supercargo? That is correct. And as supercargo you represent the cargo owner. Yet you do not recognise that name? No. I am afraid not. There we have it, then. That's that sorted out, no? Johanna. More preserve, confiture. For there is a record of your attending a flogging on board when Poseidon Blomberg was given 30 strokes of a bamboo cane - after you had reported him. - Dĺĺdh! Poseidon had complained about the crews mean pacotille allowance for the goods they could bring back to Sweden. But this is nothing... No, unfortunately not. One cannot know every man on board. Not by name. So, my dear friends. It is time at last to dance! Madam Raxelius has just told Nordin that you tended to her brother Erik. For a bullet wound. In your own home, and that you were also the best of friends. Is this true? You treated an insurgent in the Commissioner's official suite? He was seriously wounded. I considered it my duty to try to save a human life. As I would have done with anyone. No matter who. Your duty is not to save insurgents but to fight them... And I do. Erik died from a bullet from my own gun. Are you on the right side. Dĺĺdh? - Yes. - That is all I need to know. That is all we shall say on the matter for now. The prisoner Märta Raxelius is to be taken to Smedjegĺrd jail. She can go to the scaffold for all I care. I have had enough of that pair. We shall now return to the others. And please, no more politics. I believe Christensen to be involved in Poseidon's murder. - What are you saying? - He's lying. He's lying when he claims not to know his name. That is the most dreadful accusation I have ever heard! Poseidon dared to compete with him. Preposterous! So you mean that Christensen killed the cooper? Not in person. He probably hired someone to do the murder and then had Poseidon's workshop plundered for goods. I believe you have lost your senses this evening. Are you saying that a man of honour. Decorated by the king. Would be behind something like this? A personal friend. A good-hearted man. Who despite his nobility... Where did you get that waistcoat from? From Christensen. A personal gift. All the way from China. Prime quality. May I take a closer look at it? You wish to look at my waistcoat. If I am wrong. I shall retract all suspicions. You and your fancies. Dĺĺdh. Voila'. What the hell are you doing, man? Neptune. Roman god of the sea. Do you know your history. Nordin? What is the Greek name for Neptune? Poseidon. This waistcoat came directly from Poseidon's workshop. And I do not think your friend is a customer there. What do you think? Nordin, will you be so kind as to leave us for a moment. Let me question him. Under no circumstances! I have already paid 100 riksdaler in silver in reception fee for admission to his Freemasons' lodge. Under no circumstances an interrogation. I see only one way out of this. Dĺĺdh. You leave Christensen be. And I shall refrain from investigating the grave allegations levelled at you this evening regarding your dealings with the notorious Raxelius siblings. I interpret your silence to mean that we have an agreement. I thought I saw a light out here. Well, did you have a pleasant evening? I cannot do this anymore. Märta Raxelius told Nordin the truth about my friendship with Erik. And when Wahlstedt asked me if I was on the right side... I answered yes. Which is as close to a lie as one can get. I am resigning. I shall quit the post of District Commissioner with immediate effect. You cannot do that. I cannot work for the Chief of Police. While every day knowing that I live a lie. What about me? Have I no say in the matter? Freund. Come with me. I am staying. And there is nothing I can do to change your mind? No. If your husband refuses to investigate Poseidon's death I have no choice but to leave. A probably guilty man will walk free. While Poseidon's sister has to hide away with her baby. Not because she is guilty of anything. But because she was related to a rebel. Power buys a man justice. Reconsider, one more time. No. Time and again I've been prevented from doing my work honourably. I cannot submit to this any longer. Where will you go? I do not yet know. Maybe return to sea. Seek a post as ship's doctor. I understand you. I understand you. And I wish you luck. In whatever you do. I did not shoot Erik. And I have never changed sides. Not to my mind. Help me. Pull. Pull! I hear you intend to quit your post. That is tragic. Very tragic. Now, now, children. Be a little gentle with Freund. We're playing to distract us from Dĺĺdh's coming departure. - Would you wish to dine here tonight? - Thank you... but I am to escort Dĺĺdh to the inn. His stagecoach leaves early tomorrow for his journey south. I understand. That will give you a little time to yourselves. Just you and Dĺĺdh. You must send him my regards. It all points to his collusion with revolutionary circles in the city. We have found very compromising documents sewn into the lining of the dead Poseidon Blomberg's coat. Did he not have a sister too? Yes. Rosina. An unkempt woman with a fatherless child. Might she have had contact with the movement? Bring her in. But wait until darkness. We do not want to cause too much alarm in the district. He might still have some suspect followers around. Freund! Freund! I need your help. I shall be dining with my husband in a few hours' time. Notify me, before we eat... I hope we shall meet again. With God's help... Look after the lady. I shall never forget you. Well, my dear... shall we be seated? The wind is picking up. We shall have to ask Axel to stoke the fire a little higher. How has your day been? It has been quiet. Johanna and I have baked. Laundered some cuffs and handkerchiefs... I think I shall have white Rhine wine this evening. - And you? - Yes. - You have received a message? - Yes. It is from my dear cousin, Desirée... She wishes me to pay a visit. This evening! On a very urgent matter. I had better go to her. Carl Fredrik. Is it really wise, in this weather? It is but an hour's ride. I shall take the small carriage. She is recently wed to that lieutenant. You know. Who knows? Perhaps she is already having love troubles! - Then you must give her my regards. - I shall. - Magdalena...? - Yes? Take care. My cousin's name is Desirée. Her husband is Carl. I have already sent word of your arrival. They are good people. Rosina. They will help you into safer circumstances. How can I thank you. Lady Wahlstedt? Hurry! Lady Wahlstedt! Freund said you would be here. It would never have been possible without him. He knew where she lived, you see. - He knew where who lived? - Rosina. I have just saved Rosina and her baby from Nordin. It was so cold! May l...? Of course. Here. When I watched Rosina rush off over that field with her baby in the hope of a better life. I had a powerful vision. That it could easily be me and my own little daughter running there. I realised that we... we are all born equal. It is only the circumstances of our lives that separate us. I must return. If I leave now I shall be home at dawn. Magdalena... To Johan Gustaf. "When you read these lines. "L shall already be on my way back. "The storm has calmed and we have said all we need to say. "Or perhaps not. "I do not intend to persuade you to do anything. "Your mind is made up. "And maybe you are right to devote your heart to healing people. "Maybe the question of justice "will not elude you as much in the world of medicine. "We are all born, and we all die. "What can be more just than that? "Like you. "I live between hope and despair over an imperfect world. "We are many who share your sentiments. "And if you ever decide to return "I can promise that you will not have to be as alone in your endeavours. "Both Freund and I have now proved that. "Promise me never to forget your two friends in Stockholm. "Respectfully. "Your most devoted Magdalena Henrietta Wahlstedt. "The year of our Lord. 1790."
