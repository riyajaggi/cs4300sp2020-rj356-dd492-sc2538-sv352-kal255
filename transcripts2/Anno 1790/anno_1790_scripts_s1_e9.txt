 Anno 1790 (2011): Season 1, Episode 9 - De dödas röster - full transcript 
 Daadh is invited up to Uppsala by his old professor, who needs his help to find out who poisoned one of his students. Daadh involves himself in the case and quickly realises that his own life is in danger. Someone clearly doesn't like him snooping around. Meanwhile, subversive events take place at the home of chief constable back in Stockholm that will affect Daadh's future. And furthermore, his old enemy Marta Raxelius has decided to put her planned revenge into action but rather than striking at Daadh, the blow lands on someone else altogether.

 Good morning, students. In today's anatomy class we shall be looking at the lung. We shall be removing the inner walls of the lung to study the tissue where the oxygen is absorbed into the blood. Frid, a scalpel. A volunteer to make the first incisions? Moritz Dahlgren? Professor? I call up: â€śCan you bring me the egg?â€ś

 And after a lot of ifs and buts he agrees. Reaches for the nest... and falls. He falls headfirst onto the ground and just lies there. I thought he was dead! So I rush up to him. Turn him over and see right away that his elbow is dislocated. He starts screaming. He's screaming like an animal. Not having any? L go up. Must work. Is it the stomach again? Frid! You haven't got a few Coppers I could borrow? I'm bankrupt.

 Dahlgren? Leaving already. Henry? It's all right for you, you're all snug up there amongst the Professor's birds! Uppsala? What are you going there for? I shall attend a couple of lectures by my old mentor. Professor Medelheim. You are not intending to return to your old occupation. I hope? Become a doctor? No, but it would be of value to me to hear the latest ideas in anatomy. Bearing in mind my police work, too. - For how long? - A couple of days. For Freund too? I think he would benefit greatly. Given his role as tutor here. In this house. To get to hear anatomy lesson at our leading university... Thank you, that will do. Three days' absence, no longer. Take my carriage. Professor Medelheim was an apothecary at first. And a humble surgeon like myself. But then one day the king passed by his town. The king had a sebaceous cyst on his head. A sebaceous cyst? A swollen hair follicle gland. Very painful. But Medelheim removed it. Which earned him a professorship. And a peerage. He was ennobled for removing a gland? No. He was ennobled for removing a swollen gland. But why should I have to go to Uppsala? Because I want to show the Professor that I too have elevated myself. Lady Wahlstedt... DĂĄĂĄdh! You are leaving the city. - For just a few days. - Are you fleeing? I wish you to know how deeply remorseful I am. And you, sir? I too cannot feel at ease. If a simple kiss torments you... A simple kiss? Everything is so easy for you. You are free. But I have made a sacred vow of fidelity. A promise that is now broken. Is it? I cannot sleep at night, yes. You think... but what do you feel? What I felt when I kissed you cannot be put into words. But I realise that that feeling places us both in an impossible situation. So you consider it a mistake. As do you. Clearly. I apologise for my gross thoughtlessness. What occurred between us shall never occur again. May I be struck by lightning if I ever again open my heart to you. DĂĄĂĄdh. If I ever in a moment of weakness should seek your help. I ask you to utterly disregard it. Utterly. I saw the police chiefs whore exit DĂĄĂĄdh's block this morning. Exasperated and dishevelled. There is something between them. We could take her together with DĂĄĂĄdh. We must bide our time. DĂĄĂĄdh went to Uppsala late this afternoon... in Wahlstedt's carriage. For how long? The secret lies with you, now... Hedvig. Yes, uncle. We have a visitor from Stockholm: army surgeon Johan Gustav DĂĄĂĄdh. Once one of my most gifted students. Then I lost him to the king and his duties in the service of the motherland. He went to serve in victorious war against Russia. I welcome you. Warmly. Today's autopsy is devoted to the study of a radical operation to remove a cancer of the breast. Including the extirpation of the armpit lymph nodes. Carl Peter Thorén will be assisting me this morning. I shall make the first incisions myself. Ye gods, you stink Thorén! Close your mouth. - Are you crapulous from ale, sir? - No. Look here! As a professor, one has the privilege... of one's own... little supply in the cellar. Little has changed here. I even recognise some of the students. A mix of disciples young and old. But my task remains the same. To make them study hard. And refrain from abusive jests. Mockery of dialects and gossip. Just as in your days and not always with success. To the king. I have a small confession to make. It was not only for the pleasure of seeing you that I asked you here. I found one of our visiting students dead the other day. Henry Monroe. A brilliant student. The best. And the cause of death? As yet undetermined. What did the post-mortem reveal? Such would be unthinkable. You understand. Henry's father is far too renowned in medical circles in Edinburgh. Monroe. Oliver Monroe. Professor of anatomy? Sir Oliver: Yes, he will doubtless be coming here from Edinburgh to retrieve his son's body. I cannot present Henry with a dissected body. How suspicious would that not look? What message have you sent? That his son passed away suddenly. Probably a burst appendix. He had stomach pains for quite a while, did Henry. But he said nothing to me. Very well. What would you like me to do? I imagine Sir Oliver will want to conduct the autopsy himself. As I should under such uncertain circumstances. But what if he should find something improper? It would mean the end of our academy. I should like you to keep your eyes open during your visit here. I need your help. And your absolute discretion. Madam, your husband... He has fallen ill. Be sure to have DĂĄĂĄdh summoned. He's not in town. Fetch Dr Holmberg. Tell him it's urgent. Johanna... Is he not in town? So where is he? Carl-Fredrik, what's happened to you? Carl-Fredrik! DĂĄĂĄdh! What are you doing? Whose chambers are these? They belong to a dead student. But they were once mine. - What's that? - Nothing. - You're investigating! - Shh. Come on. I met such interesting people this evening. Moritz Dahlgren was tutor to the French ambassador's children. He reads French novels by night. Through his tears. And Frid drinks only well-water. Knows everything about nature. Trés, trés intéressant! It's not often I get to hear you speak French! - What have you been doing all night? - Playing cards. Look! I won it. From Thorén. And tobacco. - Now where is it...? - We'll look for it tomorrow. Come on. That Thorén, such a gambler. Had the forehead to ask me to lend him some money! He assumed I worked for a rich gentleman when I said you weren't just a former student. Oh no, but a fine commissioner. - You said that? - Yes. To whom? Everyone! I wanted to show them that you've elevated yourself. I want to thank you for bringing me here. So far from the clamour and wretchedness of Stockholm. And people aren't dying! No... Freund, your chamber pot stinks. Freund? Freund! From a crossbow. Someone has realised that I'm investigating the circumstances of Henry Monroe's death and doesn't want the truth to come out. But no one here knows that you are a district commissioner. I happened to let it slip. Your husband has been struck by a very vehement fever. I cannot guarantee that cupping will reverse its course. He may well be in its final stages. Final? Let us not distress ourselves prematurely. But he will survive? Madam, I am a medicus, not God. I shall return tomorrow morning. No, no and once more no. Everything but agreeable. No, that is out of the question. Are you not listening? You shall obey. Obey, obey, obey. You are speaking to the king's own Chief of Police! How dare you, man? Stand up! What damned haystack is this I see before me? Have you no shame? Axel! Send for DĂĄĂĄdh. A courier. At once. Commissioner DĂĄĂĄdh was the victim of an attack last night. And the guilty party might be in this very room. As we wait... for this person's conscience to catch up with him I beg all of you to assist the Commissioner in his investigations. It is a matter of our academy's reputation. Our survival. Very well. Let us move on to today's lecture... Gentlemen! ArrĂŞte! Moritz Dahlgren is a puffed up young fop! And Carl Peter Thorén is a boorish lout. I should not wish to lose either of them. They are both very gifted. But I must question them. This will be a disciplinary matter for our board. I cannot rule out that their brawl was related to Henry's murder. Or the attack on me, come to that. As you wish. DĂĄĂĄdh! Lady Wahlstedt begs your immediate return to Stockholm. The Chief of Police has fallen ill. Do they not have their own physician there? Yes... So what does she want me to do? She wants you there. I cannot leave now. - Lady Wahlstedt begs you... - That is my final word. Freund! Take Wahlstedt's carriage. Ride back to Stockholm. Be there for her. I shall come as soon as I can. Â€śLeave Hedvig be. Â€śHer heart belongs to me. Â€śShe has asked me to write you this â€śas she finds your constant staring â€śhighly disconcerting. Â€śDo as I say in assurance â€śthat it shall otherwise not go well for you. - Â€śThorén.â€ś - it's a threat, pure and simple! - Une menace! - When did you receive this? Last night. - Hence the fight. - Yes. And your interest in Hedvig is true? It is not against the law to lose your heart to someone. Hedvig is a very special girl and Thorén is an ale-soused gambler! It is thanks to the Professor that he is still here. Why? I don't know how well you know him. Let us just say that Thorén gives him special treatment. There you are. Thank you. I shall send for you when I need my next delivery. I fear we have not been properly introduced. Johan Gustav DĂĄĂĄdh. Hedvig FĂ¤lth. Your uncle, the Professor. Tells me that you have taken over the care of his birds from Henry. Correct. Did you know him well? Not so well. He spent most of his time studying in his room. Or tending to the collection. We were fellow students. Was he liked... by the others? Uncle didn't hide the fact that he thought Henry the most gifted of us. And as you know this is a bastion not only of learning but also of jealousy. After all, you have studied here yourself. - Were you jealous of him? - No. He was the best of us. His was a tragic fate. - Do you know what he died of? - A burst appendix. Uncle says. He should know. Do you recognise... this? No. It's pretty. Why do you ask? It is not so common to find a woman at a place like this... I lost my parents when I was 13. Uncle took care of me. I have worked as a journeyman surgeon since then. But now he thinks I need more theoretical knowledge. You must have many admirers... My presence here hardly pleases the Collegium Medicum. But Uncle has fought on my behalf and says he treats me the same as the men, he says. Maybe even expects more of you? Maybe. I was here earlier admiring the collection. It surprises me it hasn't been attacked by vermin. I don't think I've ever seen such a well-preserved collection. Is DĂĄĂĄdh not with you? Sir, it is I... Freund. I did not realise it was so serious. Did DĂĄĂĄdh send no word? He asked me to tell you he would come as soon as he could. What can be so important? Why does he not come when I ask him to? There have been complications. At the department. Freund, be frank. Is he angry with me? Why would he be? Lady Wahlstedt, he will be here. I cannot go into too much detail... but I can tell you he had been... summoned to Uppsala in his capacity as Commissioner. So you mean that he is staying to do police work? I am afraid so. Nor did he understand the gravity of your husbands condition, as I did not. Not fully. - You are still here? - Yes. How is your husband? Since when do you not deem it fit to stand when you address me? I consider it inappropriate for you to be in my husband's office. Alone. Our duties do not cease simply because the Chief of Police is indisposed. I order you to desist with this! And to await further instructions. From whom? One of my husband's superiors. And until then? Drinking tea, alone in our room. Do you deem it appropriate? I wish to be present during your husband's ordeal. There is nothing more you can do this evening. Go home. We need DĂĄĂĄdh here. You must persuade him to come. I place all my trust in you. The following applies from now on. You are to report everything about the Chief of Police's condition to me. - Is that understood? - Yes. None other than you are to visit him. But Madam Wahlstedt? The children? With the exception of his immediate family then. But all other contact takes place through me. As you wish. Very well. Johanna, fetch me a bottle of wine. Some roast veal and a proper knob of butter. Roast veal? - I do not think... - See to it. I work tirelessly to hold our position, sir. It is hard, very hard. We are searching high and low for DĂĄĂĄdh... but he seems occupied elsewhere. He has vanished. We do not know where he is. Not even your wife has managed to lure him here. Everyone seems to have abandoned you. Although that is not strictly true. I stand loyally by your side. I have taken the liberty of drafting a document... which I humbly ask you to sign. I think it is very important. Can you hear me, sir? Can you move your hand? A little signature, that is all. Thank you. I sincerely hope for your imminent recovery. - Frid! - I must speak with you. - Come in. - No. Walls have ears. One moment... What is it you wish to tell me. Frid? Henry was my best friend. And I noticed how he deteriorated as time went on. I think it was due to his job. His job? Working on the Professor's bird collection. I myself have collected birds and eggs since I was child. And I've never seen specimens so undamaged by vermin as his. Why is that? It has long been rumoured that the professor is experimenting to produce a preparation that will revolutionise the art of conservation. I fetch water from a nearby well for my cure. I often see the Professor meet a crofter for buying up arsenic who is known around here to rejuvenate his horses. In small doses... Arsenic? So you mean that arsenic is an ingredient of his new preparation? Henry had all the common symptoms of arsenic poisoning. Sudden ague, searing stomach pains... Why did the Professor not conclude the same? Imagine what would happen if a professor of medicine happened to poison his best student who is also the son of the great Sir Oliver Monroe by exposing him to excessive doses of arsenic? What was that? A bird. I fancied I heard voices... Come, let us return. You look tired. I often cannot sleep because of the voices I hear. I suffer such horrific dreams. Thank you for coming to tell me this. Everyone knows that I've tried to protect my birds from attack by vermin by all tried and tested means. Tobacco, spices. Sulphur. Turpentine. Nothing worked. It took me three years to find an effective formula. Which includes arsenic. Hence the meetings with the crofter. It is all completely innocent. Who else knew of your formula? No one. Not even Henry? His job was to prepare and catalogue. I always mix the solution myself. And when he died. You entrusted the collection to your niece. Yes. It is a well-known fact that exposure to excessive arsenic is dangerous. But the arsenic makes up barely a quarter of the substance we brush on. Even so. Would it not provide an obvious explanation for Henry's death? It would be dishonest of me to say that the idea had not struck me. Perhaps I am hoping that your astuteness will find another reason. Sir Oliver's inevitable post-mortem will uncover the... facts of the matter. And when does he arrive? Word was sent at once, so I daresay he will be here in a few weeks. Do you recognise this? - Why, it is Hedvig's! - Are you certain? Of course. She inherited it from my sister. It was once my mothers I have known it since I was a child. Where did you find it? Do you trust her? - Naturally. - Implicitly? Why should I not? Of course. I shall return it to her. She will be overjoyed! I should like to... if I may. - I should like a word. - We have a lecture soon. I found it under the bed in Henry's chambers. Why did you lie? I have made a promise to Uncle to renounce matters of the heart. Until I have written my thesis and sat my pro exercitio. What did you tell Uncle? - That I found it in the corridor. - Thank you. And your feelings for Thorén. Your... affair. Affair? Dahlgren said that Thorén wrote a letter claiming your hearts are as one. Mine and Thorén's? Definitely not! Where did Dahlgren get that idea from? Carl Peter has never made such advances to me. Ever. Which of you knew Henry was working with the Professor's new solution? I've heard that you're a gambler. But not a particularly successful one. The Professor's formula would be worth a fortune if one got their hands on it and sold it to museums on the continent. It is not written down. Everyone knows that. But maybe the Professor's not the only one who knows it. Maybe Henry did too? It just had to be extracted. I had nothing to do with Henry's death. Besides, all my debts have been paid. Is that so? How? Have you inherited? I must hurry to my lecture now. How well did you know Henry? We were drinking partners. It is said you were good at mimicking him. Affectionately. He found it funny too. And your debts. Who paid them off? Thorén? I shall learn who it was sooner or later. Who? The Professor. Why? I should be grateful if you did not spread that information to the other students. - You must come home, now. - I'm not finished here. Lady Wahlstedt has forbidden me to return without you. I beg you. Why are you paying Thorén's gambling debts? He is a... brilliantly talented student. Even if he sometimes devotes himself to life's pleasures rather than his books. I would rather pay than see him ruin his life in the claws of his debtors. Why do you ask? Is it not a departure from principle to pick out one student as a favourite? As much a departure from principle as it is to let Hedvig study here. As it was to disregard the overly radical ideas you held during your time here. Talent requires something a little out of the ordinary from me. The mediocre ones come and go irrespective. I apologise. It grieves me not to be able to help and that I have to leave with the job unfinished. I have received word that I must return to Stockholm. You did what you could. It could be as Frid says: That it was the Professor's new preparation that caused Henry's death. And the shot at me. Who was it then that shot? I know someone who'll be glad to see you back at least: Lady Wahlstedt. - What are you implying? - Nothing. Has she said anything to you? - About what? - About me. No. What would that be? I don't know. You're the one who's spoken to her. She was indignant that you didn't come when she called for you. - As if I were a dog. - No. She was miserable and distraught over Mr Wahlstedt's sickness. Have you started drinking water? Leopold Frid's well-water. A supreme cure. It's the water. - Beg pardon? - It's the water! - Some water? - Thank you. - You have a long night ahead. - Yes. Good night. Hedvig. Good night. Leopold. Can't you sleep? Are we... Are we doing right in leaving it all? I wish Erik had been with us. He would have been proud. - Who's there? - Adelkranz. The carriage is heading back for Stockholm. Where? Thank you. Wahlstedt's carriage has been spied at Knivsta. Have you drunk of the water? You. You're back. What's happened? - Frid, wake up! - What? You're to come with me to the Professor's office. An emergency autopsy. - I was having such a terrible dream... - Get your scalpels and come. Oh, dear God... Henry, forgive me. Where's DĂĄĂĄdh? Henry Monroe arrives in Sweden and is appointed at once to tend to Professor Medelheim's bird collection. Otherwise. Frid. You would have been the obvious choice. With all your knowledge of birds. Animals and plants, no? But then it strikes you when you see the Professor meet the crofter that the preparation he's having Henry work with probably contains arsenic. You procure some arsenic and mix it with your health-bringing well-water. And in so doing. Try to make it appear as if Henry's poisoning was caused by his daily work here in the laboratory. You also try to mislead me about that too. All to lay the guilt on you. Professor. Henry displayed the familiar symptoms of arsenic poisoning. Not least the burning thirst that only water is thought to quench. Which you make sure to supply him with. Every evening. Arsenic-laced water. You have no proof. You have already confessed. That was no confession. My distress before the souls of the dead is known to all here. As are my bad dreams. I was frightened into lying, don't you see? I've done nothing! Anyway- When you realise I have come here to investigate matters... you try to remove me too. That night, you write a false letter to Dahlgren... in the hope of directing the attention away from me. Which you also manage to do. But this is mere fantasy! Is that so? Dahlgren... We found your crossbow. Hidden away by the well. A weapon you usually use to shoot birds. But with blunted bolts so as not to spoil the plumage. But when Henry Monroe is finally out of the way it's Hedvig who's entrusted by the Professor instead. And you have it confirmed again that injustice and nepotism rule this world. Yes! Justice is not given to me. But to everyone else. Women, foreigners. They all have opportunities... You wretched, deplorable louse. Freund? Freund? Excuse me. District Commissioner sir. But you must come and help clear up matters. - Has something happened? - It is Nordin. He is out of control. I did not know who to turn to. Is Freund with you? We thought he was with you. The Chief of Police's condition has rapidly declined. Only his wife and children may enter his room. Holmberg. I do not think we have had the honour. Johan Gustav DĂĄĂĄdh. I shall inform the Chief of Police that I am here. Nordin asked me to tell you that you are welcome to speak to him. - Nordin? - Yes, he is the Police Chief pro tem. As per a letter of authorisation from Wahlstedt. - Impossible. Now excuse me. - Monsieur... You must speak first to Nordin. He is expecting you. Nordin... Wahlstedt's letter of authorisation. I wish to see it.
