 Anno 1790 (2011): Season 1, Episode 5 - Syndens lön är döden - full transcript 
 A bomb explodes in one of Stockholm's packed coffee houses. Daadh's investigation of the attack is interrupted by an order for him to put a stop to the illegal church services held by a pietistic congregation - of which Simon Freund is secretly a member. No sooner has Daadh taken care of this crisis - in his own manner - then suddenly another murder takes place that demands his attention. A respected priest in the state church is found burned to death. Daadh starts to sense that there is an unexpected link between the two murders, and that the perpetrator could be found in unsettlingly close proximity...

 The Fifth Commandment? "Thou shalt not kill. "We shall fear and love God "so that we neither harm nor hurt our neighbour "but help and befriend him in every necessity of life." Good boy. Give me a kiss. If you give me the Sixth. "Thou shalt not commit adultery. "We shall fear and love God so that we live a chaste life in word and deed "so that husband and wife will each love and honour the other."

 Johanna... Not now. Jon. I must hurry. The pastor will be pleased with you. Of that I'm certain. But are you pleased with me?

Is he one of them? A false prophet. A false prophet. I've been invited to dine at the Wahlstedts'. I can ask the kitchen if they can fit you in with the children...

 I'm afraid I cannot. - Why not? - I have a meeting. A holy meeting. I'm worried for you. Don't be. But thanks for the concern. Hi there! Look under the table in the middle... A bomb! Everyone out! A bomb! Get out! Sahlberg, no! What do you think? Was there anything you saw or heard beforehand? Anyone you'd had a quarrel with? Arranged a meeting with? Do you interrogate me. District Commissioner? Of course not, sir. But you were there. Exactly. I am assuming that the attack was aimed at me. On what grounds? It must have been one of the King's most implacable opponents. Someone who wants to harm the police authority! Did anyone know what plans you had this morning? Plans? I was thirsty, man! It was an extremely unplanned visit. Then that bomb could equally have been intended for me. - Someone might have followed me. - Or me. Pastor Verelius was sitting at your table. Do you know him? Know him? Barely. Of course we know him. Very well indeed. He is coming here for a household examination. Do you know your catechism, Lady Wahlstedt? - Of the staff. - Do you know yours. Dĺĺdh? This now takes the utmost priority. Of course. Shoo! Away with you! You little... District Commissioner! You should know that I saw several suspect figures near the inn. Gypsies. Or were they Finns? Vagrants they were, anyway. Might it have been me they wanted? - You? - Yes. Perhaps out of jealousy. Given how well my business is doing. Noted. I assure you. Lady Wahlstedt. That under the circumstances I feel fine. Naturally it was a shock, but... - God was with me. - For which we are eternally grateful. I believe I have my own suspicions. Is that so? The bomb may have been planted by the blackest sheep in my congregation. Those who feel that the King's church is not good enough for them. If you would be so kind. Johanna... "and defends me from all evil. "All this He does only out of fatherly divine goodness and mercy "without any merit or worthiness in me. "For all this it is my duty to thank. Praise, serve and obey. "This is most certainly true." Excellent. Johanna. Excellent. An exemplar for you others. You have passed the examination. Of course. With distinction! Next time is Jon's turn. I believe. That is correct. I am honoured that such an obedient girl as yourself wishes to wed my dear menial. Thank you. Pastor. Thank you very much. Let someone else clean that up. They're clues. Freund. We must attend to them. Verelius always sat at the same table. But not Wahlstedt. - So the bomb was meant for Verelius? - It's possible. But why? Pastor... Karbin? I have been expecting you. So. Karbin, let me see... how much you owe in total with today's interest. I beg you for a little more time... You can read, can you not. Karbin? Your debt shall be settled today. - My wife is ill and my businesses... - Your wife? The parish register lists you as a widower. Was ill. She was ill. I can see through all lies. I snare every untruth. Karbin. And I crush it under my heel! And besides: Pacta sunt servanda. - For the love of God. Dĺĺdh... - it's harmless now. All the same, it's no toy. No... it's a black gunpowder bomb. To think that a little rascal like this can be so confoundedly lethal. Gunpowder, shot, horseshoe nails... The person who made this is clearly familiar with the art of war. It's nothing less than a miniature version of the artillery's own petards. "Dear brother. "In peace let our drinks flow. "In this world of evil and woe." Enter. A visitor for you. Pastor. Thank you. Frida, let him in. Well, well. Jon. Upright and ready. "Thou shalt not kill. "We shall fear and love God so that we..." He seems to be doing fine. To think he had such trouble reading. Johanna has been practising with him. "shall love and fear God so that we neither harm... "shall love and fear God "so that we neither harm our neighbour in every..." "nor hurt him..." I knew it yesterday. But yesterday is not today. "nor hurt our neighbour but help and befriend him..." - It has escaped me. - Caged birds escape. Not God's words. "We shall fear and love God "so that we neither harm our neighbour. Nor hurt him "but help and befriend him "in every necessity of life." I am sorry. But I cannot issue a testimonial. But I have made a promise! Then you must wait until you have learnt it by heart. I beg you. Pastor... Come, come. Away with you. - I beg you on my knees... - Get out. I said! - Let me go! - What the hell... You are an evil man. Well? You are too hard on the boy. He did not know his Catechism. Besides, he was insolent. He wishes to be wed. Can you not show an ounce of Christian charity? Charity is for those who deserve it. My faith is as good as yours. My dear mother... albeit of a slightly different nature. How is it going? I have questioned the witnesses. But it has given nothing. - But I know more about the bomb. - Let me hear. It was charged with a gunpowder called "salute gunpowder" in which the amount of sulphur is characteristically... Johanna? The Pastor refuses to give Jon his testimonial. What are you saying? - He forgot some lines... - Then he must repeat his test. Continue. They quarreled and now he's fallen into disgrace with the Pastor. Can't you have a word with Verelius? Me? I do not interfere in his affairs. Just as I hope he will not interfere in mine. - Then I shall speak with him. - Leave it be. They want to be wed. Why should someone prevent them if they love each other? Come, come. Johanna. Dry your tears and serve the next course. Madam - miss - I bid you an exceptionally good night. I thank you for the escort. Corporal. I do not think women should walk alone at night. The city teems with all kinds of riffraff. I most certainly agree. When darkness falls. The dregs float to the surface. Is that not so. Corporal Bang? And where have you been. Mother? At this late hour? - Attending service. - Is that so? A service at which God's words were spoken by people whose spirit burns. Despite not holding an office in the Church of Sweden! I will not allow my own mother to compromise my position by attending clearly illicit gatherings. I am free to attend whatever gathering I please. Not as long as you live under my roof and under my providence. The only providence I live under is the Lord's. I shall have to ensure that you remain at home in the evenings. Even if it means locking you in. What are you implying? House arrest? Until I have purged this religious fanaticism in my parish, yes. And Frida... Frida must take great care. Frida didn't want to go. I made her. - You're lying, like a common slut! - That's enough! You behave badly, sir. Using coarse language to your own mother! And you... will keep your mouth shut! We keep a small amount of salute gunpowder here in the store room. And as far as I'm aware. Our regiment is the only one around Stockholm that uses such material. And rarely at that. - Who has access here? - Not many people. We've had a visitor. I am a man of few demands. As you surely know by now. My good sir. Nevertheless... I demand that the police intervene against these Pietist scum. We have not hunted Pietists for years. In which case it is certainly high time you did so again! They breed like blind rats. You understand. And like rats, they contaminate pious minds with their heresies. They hold covert services at 27 Östra Lĺnggatan under the ministry of one Corporal Bang. An odious little agitator. Corporal Bang? It would not surprise me if the Pietists were behind that terrible bomb attack. Is that so? I suspect the bomb was meant for me. I think you are mistaken. The target was more likely to have been me. You, sir? A man in my position has many... enemies. But that is the price one pays for being one of the King's closest men. I am also the King's man. But more so God's, are you not? Now you will have to excuse me. Pastor. I have much to do. I maintain that the police must do their duty... whatever the circumstances. Private services are against the law. And it is the police authority's duty to ensure that the law is obeyed. Of course. My dear Chief of Police. We are both the King's men... and it is imperative that we assist one another... when necessity demands. Is that not so? I shall see what I can do. Come, come, my girl. Chin up. Everything will be all right. The bomb was probably manufactured by a person with military experience. I see. Salute gunpowder is distributed only to certain regiments. And as it transpired. Someone broke... Yes, yes. Just be quick to make an arrest. Tonight you are to raid a service of Pietists. Tonight? I have been informed of both time and place. - With all respect, should we not... - Verelius believes they are after him. I myself believe services to be peaceful affairs, but what do I know? Arrests will not stop the Pietists. Do your duty. Dĺĺdh. What's happened? Wahlstedt has ordered me to conduct a raid on your service tonight. At Verelius's insistence. Can you hold it elsewhere? We shall not be cowed. I forbid you to go. You are still in my service. With all due respect. Dĺĺdh. I am no serf. You will stay here. See to your chores. I must work. Johanna? Forgive me if I am disturbing you. Pastor. No, no, by no means. Come in. Come, come. Close the door behind you. So... what is on your mind. My dear Johanna? You said today at the chief of police's home that everything would be all right. Pastor. And I am wondering, how? How? Yes. How will everything be all right? Every what thing? Is there anything I can do for Jon to obtain his testimonial? Why, yes. There is indeed. Come here. Come here, my dear child. My brothers and sisters in faith. If the Church is to preach true piety she must cease her dogmatic persecution... - Frid, I want it peaceful this time. - Understood. Nordin. I shall go in and check all the escape routes. My friends, the Church that claims to be the one true church is no church. No House of the Lord. But a House of Lies! A House of Snakes! Brothers and sisters. If the Church is to preach true piety she must, like the snake. Shed her skin. She is not the House of God! She is the House of Lies and Snakes! Do not fear! Do not fear! God is with us! Up! Go up! - I suffer from severe vertigo! - You deserve to suffer. Stay here until I come and fetch you. And this time. Obey my orders! When are you coming back? Dĺĺdh! Fall in! Stand still! "Quake ye not, ye little flock." Let's see how that works in the penitentiary! Out of the way! After him! Damn! Damn! I'll kill that damned priest! My conscience torments me. You must understand. Some... Some preachers conduct themselves... as if they were priests and preachers merely in order to enjoy earthly pleasures. I refuse to be one of them. I cannot, after all. Disobey God's commandment. There, now. Off with you. Oh. Heavenly Mother... Was that the last? Freund? Drunk in the gutter again? You're late. There's no one up there. We're finished here. Nordin. You called for me? Step inside. You displease God the Father. What do you mean? People are talking. I do not understand... I know very well what takes place in the salons when I am not at home. At your age. Surely you do not deem it appropriate? What did he tell you to do? Bless it by... somehow... suckling it. Suckle? Oh, my poor child. I have sinned. I did it for us, for Jon and me. And yet we still cannot be wed. Will I go to Hell now? I beg to speak to the pastor. He's not here today. Nobody's seen him. Burnt by fire. What the hell does this mean? That the bomber succeeded at his second attempt? May I take a seat? I wished him dead. Can one wish another person to death? Who? The pastor? Why did you wish the pastor dead? What if it was Jon taking his revenge on the pastor? I shall look into it. It was not you who took the man's life. You know that. My poor wife. Such a ghastly affair, this. Not even a man of the cloth is safe. My theory is as follows. With the ecclesiastical war now raging. Corporal Bang must be our chief suspect. Corporal Bang? Issue the order. It seems the pastor was earning a considerable income as a usurer. What if he was punished by our Heavenly Father? He vaunted himself. I can promise you that the one who did this was of flesh and blood. And what": more... the case has suddenly taken an unexpected and unpleasant turn. "Wahlstedt"? Ergo. Wahlstedt also had a motive. A debt of several hundred riksdaler. Was he not in rather a hurry to leave the inn... Hold your tongue. We're talking about a man who's devoted his life to justice. You know what desperation can do to a man... - So desperate... - he might well have been. The shame of being unable to repay a debt. Maybe the pastor threatened reprisals. Wahlstedt's office, reputation, family. Everything was at stake. It wouldn't be so bad, for you. If the Chief of Police was put in jail. Do you remember what King David did to Uriah to obtain his wife. Bathsheba? No bloody idea. Let us concentrate on this. Mats Karbin. And? It could be a military name. Our condolences. I am sorry to have to trouble you in your grief but I should like to ask you some questions. Does it not smell of fish in here? I suppose it is cook, who... It is time for dinner, after all. - Fish. - Fish. Do you know of a Mats Karbin? No. The name is unknown to me. When did you last see your son? Last night. - Just before bed-time. - And where was he? In his study. As usual. Did he have any enemies that you know of? Not as far as I know. Someone who might have wanted to harm him... It is his punishment. I suppose. He had angered God. If we assume that the bomb was made by a soldier... Karbin is a military name... As is Bang. And he was at the Jolly Arabia when the bomb exploded. Wasn't Bang sitting with someone... Freund? You stink. Unfortunately that damned windbag can prove that he was home all night. Let me speak to him. Leave it open. I am no killer. District Commissioner. As your batman will testify. But you were at the Jolly Arabia when the bomb exploded. With whom were you sitting? Was he... one of us? - No. - So who was it? - No one special. - No one special? And yet you sat drinking together. An old acquaintance from the army. Name? Bang... Mats Karbin. Karbin? Where can we find him? He's a farrier these days. Has a workshop somewhere on the south island. Thanks. Bang. Dĺĺdh. Dĺĺdh. I shall have a word with Nordin. See what I can do. I served with the artillery. But so did a few hundred other men. But they're a few hundred men who didn't borrow money off Pastor Verelius. I owed him money. But the kind gentleman gave me some respite. What did you do last night? I slept. - Alone? - No, with my wife. She can confirm it. Lisa. Lisa! Karbin! - He's locked the door. - Damn him! Nordin has arrested Jon. He says he's going to tear the truth out of him! Lady Wahlstedt. Let my maid talk to the boy. Or shall I return with my husband? You're bloody ugly when you smile. He was not an honourable man, but I would never have... Do you believe me. Johanna? I thought maybe you'd done it for my sake. For what he made me do. What did he make you do? Johanna, what did he make you do? Nothing. Freund... Yes? Gunpowder, fuses, shot. Horseshoe nails... He has a small bomb factory here. He kills to free himself from debt. His debts will be inherited, no? By his mother. I mean. She still has the promissory notes. I suppose. Until Karbin gets there... - We're looking for Lady Verelius. - Madam is not at home. It still smells of fish in here. Frida, was it? We need access to the pastor's room. Not there, it's his room. The pastor is dead. Fish glue. Where is Lady Verelius? In church. Oh. Mats! It's all over at last. - Nothing is over. - What? What do you mean? God will forbid it. Forbid what. Lady Verelius? Mats Karbin, you are under arrest for the murder of Pastor Verelius. You're wrong. Mr Dĺĺdh. I'm the guilty one. I realised... I could no longer let him continue tormenting the defenseless... and sin against the Most High. A facade of piety that concealed an impenitent soul. Step inside. You displease God the Father. What do you mean? People are talking. I do not understand... I know very well what takes place in the salons when I am not at home. At your age. Surely you do not deem it appropriate? Whore. There's no other word for you. And you? How do you live? Are you being insubordinate? Now that surprises me. I thought you knew me. Mother. I thought you knew my holy wrath. Help! Help me! Help me, woman! Help! Help me! Mother! I still wanted my son to be buried in consecrated ground. Mother... But the ground was frozen and that's when I thought of the ossuary. No love is worth a price so high as taking the life of one's own son. But the bomb at the inn was your work. Karbin? I am afraid that you both will have to follow me. No one has died except the pastor! He deserved it. You forget the innkeeper. I don't want to die! I did not come into this mortal life to be hanged! Move another inch. And I'll set this off! - Control yourself. Karbin. - I'm not going to be hanged! In here! - You solved not one case, but two. - No, thank you. Highly satisfactorily. Thank you. I'm wondering... You didn't happen to find a black notebook on the pastor? Do you mean this? I'm afraid the flames reached it before I could ascertain its value as proof. I don't deserve it. I will hear no more of that nonsense. Jon would never wed me if he knew... My dear child. How befouled I am. I now ask you. Jon Eriksson. In the name of the Holy Trinity and in the presence of God's congregation: Will you take this person, Johanna Westling, as your lawfully wedded wife and love her in sickness and in health? Yes. I now ask you, Johanna Westling, in the name of the Holy Trinity and in the presence of God's congregation: Will you take this person. Jon Eriksson. As your lawfully wedded husband and love him in sickness and in health? Yes.
