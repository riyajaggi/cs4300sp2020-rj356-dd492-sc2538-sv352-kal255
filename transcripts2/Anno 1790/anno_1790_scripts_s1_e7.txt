 Anno 1790 (2011): Season 1, Episode 7 - Ödets blinda hand - full transcript 
 A number of children are found dead in the great piles of excrement and rubbish that line Stockholm's shoreline. Daadh's investigation leads him to the Great Orphanage, but there they claim to know nothing about the bodies. One of the children from the Orphanage is chosen to carry out the drawing in the Number Lottery, a popular event where large amounts of money are in play. And to Daadh's dismay and anger he is forced to concede that a child's life is worth little when money is at stake.

 - here in the city. - It is not only a duty, but an honour. So have you had much to investigate recently. Godfather? Do not believe all you hear in the provinces. This is a safe city. Not much happens here. Here, would you care for a cake? Thank you. Lackleg! Get to work. I'm watching you. Many men would be happy to take your place. He'd drowned, the boy, but... was found on land. I've asked Nordin to search the archives

 for other missing children of the same age. - He should be here any time now. - Take a seat. Mr Dĺĺdh, you have proved an exceptionally skilled Commissioner. - I thank you. - But I wonder... how well you know your district. I'm getting to know it more by the day. In Odenstein's days it was the haunt of revolutionary rabble! Since you took over. Few arrests have been made. Have you an explanation for this current discrepancy? They might... of course have moved to other districts? But still this discrepancy. I daresay... it will be about this that His Majesty will be asking about. - His Majesty? - Yes. I have been summoned to an audience with the king. One child has been reported missing that fits the description of the boy. "Mĺns Bengtsson." Nordin... Do we know any more? - Like what? - How he disappeared. Who might have wished him harm. You can read there where his mother lives. You can investigate it, no? The Hiärn Manor. I thought Mans had just run away. Had he done so before? What made you think he'd done so this time? I told him not to meddle. He just wanted to protect me. Protect you from whom? His father. I should like to speak to your husband. Where may I find him? Mrs Bengtsson... He's dead. He died three years back. When did Mans go missing? It is the fifth winter now. We're seeking a boy who disappeared recently, not five years ago. This boy is not Mans Bengtsson. It's no secret that it's just drunkards who work in the archive here. It would be fitting if you took a bit more care, even if it is a child. I have said it before and shall say it again. This boy was the only one who fitted the description. How can a child disappear and no one miss him? There is no mercy for paupers and children. But this is no pauper child. Look at the clothes. This child had a home. Someone who cared. Such children don't just disappear. Burying a child in a dung heap. Despicable. Dĺĺdh... These blotches... - A poor diet. - So... So the clothes suggest prosperity... but the body, neglect. Yes? He was a child without a home... whom nobody misses. Lie still! Still! This will teach you... not to go creeping... around the pantry! Thou shalt not steal! Thus sayeth the Lord our God! My name's Johan Gustav Dĺĺdh. District Commissioner. A disgrace is what you are! Thou shalt not steal! August Krantz! I caught him in the larder. He was trying to steal food. Anton, is that right? How may I assist you. Commissioner? Are they hungry? Full or hungry, poor or rich. It does not excuse a sin. This is a sanctuary for all children. The ones who come to us would never have survived on their own. I see it as a great act of charity. So what can I do for you. Commissioner? I was wondering if you've lost a boy from here recently. - Do I amuse you? - Do you have children yourself? - No. - I thought not. They don't know what's best for them. They come here, we look after them. They run away. So you don't keep records of the children you have here? I count them every morning and I count them every evening. I cannot recall one day when those numbers did not match. Then I should like to ask you to help me in another way. This is Annarella. Director of the orphanage. - Good evening. - Good evening. Do you recognise him? Do you know if he was registered at the orphanage? When you've been there as long as I. All the faces... well, they merge into one. How long have you been there? My entire life. Commissioner. Mother died when I was eight and Father was... old and infirm. So I tried to get by on my own. But it's hard when you own nothing. So you have no idea who this boy is? No. Poor child. Can you show me? You must stay away from the pantry. - Were you hungry? - I wasn't looking for food. So what were you looking for? Some soap. What do you need soap for? He's coming tomorrow. If I look really smart he'll choose me. We'll never be parted. Anton... Mama and Papa are watching over us and will make sure we're never parted. You bloody little brat! Come forward. Come forward and I'll show compassion. I know you're in here. It'll be one lash of the whip for every step I have to take here. One... Two... Two lashes... Is that enough. Or do you want more? August Krantz! Where are you? August Krantz. He will be here soon! Where are you? August Krantz! August! And, er... What do you do? And you, how old are you? Speak when you're spoken to, boy! Most of them do not know their age. My name's Anton and my sister's name is Lisen. Is that so...? Well... Excuse me... If you don't mind, this way. Lisen, come with me. Come with me. I say. Come on. Off with you back to work! What is that smell? Straw and dung. I know what straw and dung smell like. This is something else. Corruption. Who found him? Lackleg. He's not here and no one misses him either. Lackleg? He has something wrong with that bloody leg of his. Says it prevents him working like everyone else. Show me where he was found. Down there. Why is there no one working here? They're superstitious. There's a curse on this dung heap. They say it was the Devil who took the boy. Is that what you believe? Pah! I know where you can find Lackleg. If he's not at The Cock. He'll be at Eggan's inn. We usually find animal remains in these heaps. This is from the species homo sapiens. What? A homo what? It's a human bone. A small human. There... There's at least one more body. - You have just the one man with you? - Yes. We need to excavate the whole heap. Take a pitchfork and get working. You have to help too. Jergen Lackleg? Jergen Lackleg? Over there. District Commissioner Dĺĺdh. This is Simon Freund. This is my only sanctuary. This is my lot. Which the Lord has given me. This and a leg. Which is of no use to anyone... Not that leg again! I know nothing. We have found three dead children. Three? Why did you sneak off? I didn't sneak off. You weren't at work today when you should have been. Where were you? I've been here the whole time. Ask anyone. Have you seen anything odd. There on the dung heaps? No. And never shall I set foot there again. Never. That place is cursed. I wish to speak to Mr Wahlstedt. What is that smell? Mr Dĺĺdh wishes to see to Mr Wahlstedt but he is at the wig-makers. - Shall I ask him to wait? - You smell of death and decay. I can come back later. Johanna... prepare a bath for Mr Dĺĺdh while he waits. That is kind, thank you. But I can wash at home. But you have no bath tub. I have a wash tub. You need a bath tub. I think. Johanna. Please prepare a bath for Mr Dĺĺdh while he waits. I shall take a walk with Miss Clara in the meantime. Clara... It is such a lovely winter's day. Shall we go out for a walk with Fidel? I am a little tired. You are not anxious about tomorrow? It is but a lottery! Someone wins, someone loses. It is no disaster if you lose. You will just have to get married next year. Thank you. Godmother. I shall keep that thought. Shall we go before the sun goes down? The waters are frozen. How wonderful. My dear Clara... whatever could be the matter? You do not have a fever I hope? I just want everything to go well. Maybe it would be best for you to rest. We can take a walk another time. I shall be downstairs sewing. Should you wish for company. Your clean clothes. Mr Dĺĺdh. Thank you. Johanna... Fetch a stool. Johanna... Fetch a stool! Take a deep breath... Lady Wahlstedt? I think you should be the one to examine Miss Johanna. You don't need a doctor. You need a midwife. Johanna! Do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions. I shouldn't want to disturb you. Ma'am. You wouldn't be disturbing me. A baby will be born in this household. Every child is a gift from God. Gentlemen! If you please... All the children were aged 10. Two boys, one girl. I'm assuming none of them died a natural death. Yet you didn't question that Lack... - Lack... - Lackleg. Lackleg properly. No, not in the way you'd have done. No, you said "Excuse me". "Sorry". "Thank you, thank you very much". As usual. - Lackleg knows nothing. - Gentlemen... Lackleg knows nothing. Do you know anything else other than that they were murdered? I know with certainty that they were paupers. What puzzles me is... the expensive clothes. I have been around the city... talking to tailors, but... no one knows anything. Yet you still think they're from the orphanage? Yes. Poverty and starvation is everywhere. But parents would miss their child. These children were not missed. I can think of only one time when orphans are dressed up. And that is? When the children have been selected to do the draw in the Royal Lottery. Anton... I'll ask Annarella to ask them if they can take you too. They told me I'm going to a big house. Far away from here. And you won't ever go hungry because there are apple trees and you can pick as many as you like. And they have horses there. I will never leave you. I promise. Now, my dear Goddaughter... Clara... it is late. Can we not play a while longer? Clara must go to her bed. It is a big clay tomorrow. - Goodnight, Godfather. - Goodnight, my dear Goddaughter. Goodnight. - Do you have something on your mind? - I should like to ask you something. Tell me. - Carl-Fredrik... - Yes. I should like to resume my work as a midwife. But you know that is impossible. So many paupers aren't being helped. Women are dying in childbirth. Wholly unnecessarily. You are in all truth a good woman. And I love you for that. It's not only that. I don't know how to busy myself! For many hours of the day I'm unoccupied now that Freund is here teaching the children. It is not suitable work for a woman of your status. It gets so quiet... Magdalena, you do a good deed every day just by being here. You give... You give me the peace of mind I need to work with justice. And that benefits everyone. Even the poor. Of course. Goodnight, my dear wife. Goodnight. "To you! ' And you! This will be exciting to watch. Have you never witnessed a Royal Lottery? Explain it to Mr Dĺĺdh. Magdalena. See that wheel? Around it are ninety small holes each containing a numbered lot. The winning lot can win 1.000 riksdaler! I see. And what number do you have. Miss Clara? We have no numbers. For each lottery, the county governors each choose a girl of marrying age. And she can win 100 riksdaler. "To encourage wedlock and procreation." Our king needs more soldiers! I hereby declare. In my capacity as lottery director. The 64th draw of the Royal Lottery open! As is meet. The blind hand of fate will choose the winner! Is everyone happy? Yes! Then let the draw commence! Spin the wheel of fortune and let capricious fate play out her drama! Bonne chance, mesdames et messieurs! The winning number, mesdames et messieurs... is number... 58! Who won? And while we await the winner to come up to the stage... Time for the name draw! I may announce that the young lady who... will take home a dowry is none other than... Henrietta Pontén from Ĺngermanland! Now, where is our number 58? There... Congratulations! - Jergen Lackleg! - Who? Lackleg. I have to talk to him. And now, for your entertainment mesdames et messieurs... Get ready... Where did he go? Who? Jergen Lackleg. Who the hell is Jergen Lackleg? - The man who just came up on stage. - He was in a hurry. - But they are innocent children! - I know what they are. My answer is no. If the murders have any connection with the lottery I must talk to everyone! His Majesty is the patron of the lottery. It is above all suspicion. I am personally acquainted with Mr. Retting the director. And I can vouch for him personally. Let me talk to Retting, discreetly. I demand you leave the lottery alone and keep it free from all suspicion. Do I have your word on it? Well? - Of course, you have my word on it. - Good. The results of the lottery may not be appealed. On your way! I am not here to appeal or... to cast suspicion on procedures... Director Retting, Sir. I do apologise. As you will understand. My business arouses strong emotions. Misfortune is a heavy burden for men to bear. So, how may I help you? My name is Johan Gustav Dĺĺdh. And I am district commissioner. I was wondering about the lottery archives. The lottery is under His Majesty's patronage, and the archives too. I need the names of the orphans who have been the hand of fate in the past few years. The archives. Peter Wilhelm? No, he's no longer here. Maja-Stina Olofsdotter? No, she's no longer here either. Carl? - Surname? - Magnusson. No. No longer here. Mans Bengtsson? No. - But you remember him? - Yes. An intelligent lad. Abraham Retting was very pleased with him. He did the draw many times if I remember correctly. Did you know his mother lived at one of the city manors? That doesn't surprise me. Do you think he returned there? No. You think he's one of the dead children? What do you think? - Was that all of them? - No. - Lise-Lott Ryd. - Lisen. August, fetch Lisen. This is Anton. Lisen's brother. What is this? Have you lost your senses again? She's missing. She's not on her cot. We must find her. The orphanage might be no paradise. But in this darkness anything can happen. - Lise-n! - District Commissioner! District Commissioner! - You must come! - What is it? I've found another. On the dung heap. Lisen! No! Where is she? She? I swear by all that's holy. Nordin. Don't play games with me. There. Lackleg! Lisen? Where is Lisen? - What are you doing here? - Shh! - Where are we going? - Shh! Be quiet! I promised I wouldn't leave you, didn't I? You bloody little brats. Try to escape will you...? Run. Anton! So Lackleg murders three children then goes himself to meet his maker. That cannot be right. What has happened to the girl. Lisen? - Killed by Lackleg. - And who killed him? One of his drinking cronies I shouldn't imagine. I still don't understand. Why would Lackleg have murdered all those children? Now, now, now... It is a good story and one I will tell His Majesty this evening. Mirror. Unless you've found some collaborators whom I may present to him. That is. I thought as much. Then so be it. A murderer is at large. Lackleg was the murderer and Lackleg is dead. Are you leaving now? I saw one of the orphans outside. So, what do you think? Like a... Like a Hercules. I can but agree. Magdalena! I never found out how it went for the young miss in the lottery. Fortune did not smile on us. Then I shall wish you a fine evening regardless. - Where is the book? - Here is the book. Where were we? "I called him Friday..." Hands off the food! Are you hungry? Would you like more? Freund... What were you doing out there all alone? We were going back to our parents. If you have parents. Why are you at the orphanage? They're dead. But if you get chosen for the lottery you get nice clothes and new parents. Who told you that? Lisen. And where is Lisen? I mustn't tell. Who mustn't you tell? Who told you not to tell anyone? Was it Abraham Retting. The lottery director? Anton, who told you not to say anything? Who are you frightened of? You know if you whisper. No one knows you've said anything. August Krantz. The janitor? If he finds you he whips you like this. Lisen! So you like flogging children? Don't hit me! Don't hit me. Please... Someone has to flog Satan out of them! Was that why you killed them? Because Satan was in them? I've not killed anybody. Three children have been found dead. For the past five years. Every child involved with the lottery has vanished. I've not killed anyone! I've not killed anyone! I was at war! I was at war for all those years! I swear I don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about! Annarella and I take care of these children. They would starve to death if we didn't take them in. Annarella? What have you done with Lisen? Nothing! I left Lisen... What have you done with Lisen? Nothing. I gave her to Annarella as ordered. - And where are they? - I don't know where they are. I don't know where they are. I just saw them leave. If you gentlemen could spare a shilling I could answer some questions. How can we know that you have the answers we seek? I see more than you might think. Have you seen Annarella? She was carrying buckets of water. She entered a door on Svartmannagatan. Retting's office. Did you notice if she had Lisen with her? Not then. But before that? Yes. Bring her over here. Bring her over here. I said. What separates people is money. That's all the matters. Without money, you're nothing. New there's only you left and then everything will be fine. That's right... - We should get help. - No time. Wahlstedt has expressly forbidden... involving Retting in this! So now when our searches lead us in to the finest rooms should we just sit there with folded arms out of fawning respect? We should await orders, go back to... Wahlstedt is with the king! It could be hours before he returns. Come on! It does not bode well to disobey Wahlstedt... Freund, the girl! What shall I do? I don't know what to do! Freund! Lisen? Here! Let her go. Shoot him! You have but one shot. You cannot shoot us all. I said shoot him! Don't make matters any worse. Shoot him! Shoot him. I said! There, there... it's not that serious. You can rest in the jail. What is your name? Mans. Mans Bengtsson. What's happened? They'd pushed her head under water and tried to drown her. Incomprehensible! How can one cheat the lottery? His Majesty is the patron! They probably used some kind of see-through blindfold. That is irrelevant. The pegs all look the same. It was one of the spokes. It had been filed down to look different. The right lot was in that spoke. It was still hard, though. But I could find it in the end. That's not good enough. How did they get hold of all the money? Mans helped Annarella select lot-buyers who could act as decoys for a share of the profit. But why Lackleg? On your feet! Was that not a bit risky bearing in mind what he had found in the straw? I didn't pick Lackleg. He came into the office one day. He'd found a blindfold alongside the dead boy. So Annarella decided to let him win. And then you killed him. Come... And director Retting... did he know anything about this? Mr Retting only comes in twice a month. Once to do the draw and once to collect his pay. So he was not involved, then. I am here to collect the prisoner. Not yet. Give me a second. I have met your mother. Your father is dead. He died over three years ago. Right, this way then. Mr Dĺĺdh... Say nothing to Mother. It's better if she believes me dead. His Majesty will be very displeased about this. They've just dropped off. Shall they be returned to the orphanage? Shall I take them there tomorrow? Let's sleep on it. I hope we have not kept you awake with all the running around this evening? Clara? Do not be sad. We shall help you in every way we can. There will be a wedding. I promise. No... I'm pregnant. Oh. Clara... Fortunately you are at least betrothed. I'm sure the priest will still give you his blessing... But he can't. Clara, what's happened? I was walking in the woods on the way to see Hĺkan when... suddenly they were there... Who? I tried to struggle. Then I thought that... if I was lucky enough to win the dowry we'd be able to wed before he noticed anything. I don't know how I could have been so stupid. Clara... - This is Lisen... - Good day. Lisen. And Anton. Good day. Anton. I'm Anna-Maria Bengtsson. But you may call me Mother. Go now... Come in and I'll show you around.
