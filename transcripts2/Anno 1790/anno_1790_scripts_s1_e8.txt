 What are you thinking, child? Magdalena? What's going on? - Nothing. - What was that noise? I dropped a plate. - Clara's washing. - Well... Magdalena... Please help me. You are a midwife, you're the only one who knows how to do it. You're the only one who can. It's too dangerous. You can die too, not just the child. It's a difficult procedure- And the person who does it can be sentenced to death if they're caught. I'm sorry.

 I'm sorry. - You received letters. - Letters? Perhaps an invitation to Mrs. Wĺhlstedt's birthday. Yes. What were you going to give her as a present? What would be considered appropriate? - A prayer book. - A prayer book? Or a flower. There is a winter crop in Vituna yard. Your senses fail you. I don't want to beat you, but it's gone too far. I curse you! - Is this the way to Vituna? - Yes, up here. So... Oh... Hello! - Who are you? - I want to buy a flower. Are you the son of the house? - No, I'm the servant here. He's my master. Oh, calm. - Where's everyone? - Edward's in the building. Mrs. Esperson and Miss Elouise are in the yard. I'll ride down the road, and bring them back. Come here. So, so, so. Come on. Come on. I found him like this. I'm sorry for your loss. There was a nail in the softest part of the hoof. Then I understand the horse was wild. It may have been an accident. I will give this to Magdalena. It can hang here. Although the horseshoe mark is random- - So I don't understand how an adult, healthy man didn't manage to escape. No. Perhaps you can hold it. Stranger things have happened. Up. No, down. The farmhand didn't seem at all surprised, and no one else either. A mishap. For an offense, someone must be prosecuted. Do you suspect murder? - I want to examine it. - Do so. - Yes. - "Allez." Well, Dĺĺdh... This is for you, as a little appreciation. For the party. - There is too much, Mr. Wĺhlstedt. - You can try it on at home. Of course. Thank you kindly. - What a juicy pheasant. - I was going to take Clara out tomorrow. To one of the islands. - It sounds like an excellent idea. - We'll be gone most of the day. - You are on your feet. Good! - Yes, thanks to your wife Magdalena. Go ahead, sit down. Magdalena told me about your planned trip. Yes. It'll be wonderful. I can't wait. Maybe I should go. - It sounds fantastic. - No, sorry. I can't do it. Take the opportunity and see all the beautiful places around here. And if Mademoiselle pleases maybe we can play controversy tonight. Yes. Do what you do, I'm not much for games. I'm such a bad loser. My father was buried today. Mother and Elouise are at peace inside. You can't just step in. Dĺĺdh must investigate your father's body. - Mrs. Esperson... Miss. - Commissar Dĺĺdh. This shouldn't take long. - I found what I was looking for. - Are we finished? No, quite the opposite. - Murder? - His hands were tied. - Who do you think did it? - I want to ask you that. Eberhard was a righteous man. He had no quarrel with anyone. - No. - Joel? - Yes, Mr commissar. - You are the servant here on the farm. - Yes. - You were sent to shop. At the grocer on Västerlĺnggatan. You can sit down. - We passed a house on the way here. - Crofters. We have almost nothing to do with them. - But you must know who they are. - Ĺberg. A man and his wife. - Are they good people? - I have never had problems with them. - But someone else has. - I didn't say. Has anyone had trouble with the crofters? Now they are here. Unfortunately, we have to go. I'm the district commissar, I'm looking for your husband. I haven't seen him since yesterday. He threatened to enlist. - You don't seem particularly worried. - He's too cowardly to be a soldier. He crawled for that pig. - What pig? - Eberhard Esperson, of course. - Eberhard. - He wasn't so popular. We'll ride back to the farm. This crofter, Ĺberg, did he have a quarrel with Mr. Esperson? - I don't gossip. - I'm the commissar. And he? The crofter cursed this place. He said if he didn't have to be drawn into the secrets- -He was pleased and grateful. - Do you understand the secrets? - No. "Everything was destroyed," he said. Dĺĺdh, come here. Do you see the tracks? They lead in, but not out. The tracks don't come from those we spoke with. Stop. No! still! Freund! Freund! Take the boy. - Where are you taking him? - To the city. - Is it necessary? - Who's the boy? They say he's a beggar child they care for. - They call him "Pimple". - "Pimple"? That isn't sensible. Well... Sven Ĺberg. - What should he be arrested for? - Murder. - Do you know where he lives? - He isn't there. - Where should I look? - Among the newly registered soldiers. The boy, is he suspected of anything? - Stop that! - Nordin, let him be. - He doesn't behave in any case. - Can someone lock up this boy? - I'll question him first. - Who goes there? - I do. - Clara. Did anyone see you? - No. I told Johanna to organize laundry. Come on. I'm just finished. So. Don't be afraid. Are you afraid? No matter what happens I'm grateful. It will go well. Are Magdalena and Clara back? They are down in the basement arranging the laundry. So there, dear Clara. Now the worst of the pain is over. Now you just lie still. Ma... Magdalena... Clara! Clara. No, no, no... Clara? Clara, wake up! Say something! No, no, no... Clara! She doesn't stop bleeding. Chocolate. As a confection. Taste. No. Were you in the stables when the accident happened? If you tell me what happened in the barn you'll get more chocolate. - Dĺĺdh, you must come. - What is it? - She's bleeding, it's urgent. - Who? - What must I do? - We have to get her up. She must be higher than the heart. Clara? Clara? I have lesson. I'll take him away. Just make sure he doesn't escape. - What have I done? - Mrs. Wĺhlstedt. - What have I done? - So... I'll be punished as a murderess. And my children... Magdalena, no one will know anything. We'll clean everything. It's all right. Clara? Clara... - She breathes. - Miss Clara? Please, fine... Everything is my fault. I asked Freund to get him. He saved Clara's life. Mrs. Wĺhlstedt did what she thought was the right thing. She forgot to ask if I were of the same mind. If I felt the Chief Constable's wife can perform... infanticide- -in a wash house! The penalty... Like this... No one will accuse Wĺhlstedt's wife. Never a word about this here. Ever to anyone. For the sake of both of you I'll never utter a word. Please go now, Dĺĺdh. Clara tried to hang herself in her room. It was so close. The child isn't her fault. She was assaulted by three men in the woods. Why did she walk in the woods? I'm sorry. Forgive me. I must see to Clara. Damn! He's here now. - Who? -The soldier you were looking for. Sven Ĺberg. He's waiting in the cell. She ran in the yard all the time. I wanted to know what she did. What did she say? She couldn't stand I crawled for that fellow. - Eberhard. - I was a coward. You wanted to prove the contrary. Yes, a woman's infidelity removes all the power from a man. - You went to see him. - He even denied it. And it made you angry. - You got angry and hit him. - Yes. - What did he do? - He laughed and said: "You can't scare me with blows. I'm used to it." - Everything went black. - You struck him. Then you drove the nail into the horse's foot, and waited. What? You killed Eberhard Esperson. - No. - He was the man your wife wanted. No, she didn't bother him. Mr. Esperson told me of her movements. - You said... - With his son Edward. The commissar. The commissar! Clara has awakened. I'll get ready for the birthday party. - I'm not ready yet. - But please, Carl-Fredrik... I'm ashamed, I have no energy to play games. You must have the energy. You should greet all your guests. You should laugh at their jokes. You will smile, and behave like the good hostess you are. Have I made myself clear? The farmhand told the truth. - Have you been to the grocer? - Yes. He remembered him well. Apparently he was there two days earlier and purchased the same thing. I asked the grocer if it was common to buy so much sugar. The answer was no. It was unusual. The farmhand was sent away because he wasn't supposed to be there. I'll make a trip to the farm tomorrow morning. - I saw your carriage. - One thing I don't understand. Why did the groom buy a new sugar-loaf when he had just done the same thing? I dropped it on the floor. So it was you who sent Joel there? Yes. Was it before or after you amused yourself with Mrs. Ĺberg? You don't deny it, I know. I hadn't planned to deny it. Did your father know about it? He knew nothing. How could he then tell Ĺberg about it? I dropped the sugar loaf, there's nothing remarkable in that. Was it you who sent Joel to the merchant? Yes. - Tell me about your husband. - He is dead and of blessed memory. Was he also blessed in life? Let the dead rest in peace. - What's wrong with your legs? - It is what it is. - I have to live with it. - I'm a doctor, I can help you. Ouch! What are you doing, man? - What happened? - I fell. I'm not always so steady on my feet. I don't think you will fall again. What do you think? I'd be very surprised. You're good with flowers. Yes. Have you seen the orchid? Isn't it beautiful? I got it from a man who wished me well. Not from your father, then? Did you know varieties of orchids multiply in hot and cold weather? When it's hot, they reproduce like other flowers- - But if it lives in the cold it pollinates itself. Its own pollen on its own pistil. Yet it's the most beautiful flower I know. In nature there is both beautiful and loathsome things. I just have a small question. Why did farmhand go to buy a sugar-loaf two days after he had bought one? It was my fault, I dropped it. Did you send Joel to the merchant? Yes. Did the father of the child you're expecting give you the orchid? No. Thanks, I have no more questions. Stolt. Ulfberg. We'll bring all three to Stockholm. Dĺĺdh, you know what your prisoner has done? - Sit down. - "Pimple" pissed all over the cell. All of you said you broke the sugar loaf. I don't care who it was. What I'm interested in is which of you killed Eberhard. Who? If no one confesses, I'll find a scapegoat. One who can't speak for himself. A child. I'll go and fetch the boy. - It was me. - Elouise, no. My father pushed me, and I beat him. - I struck father. - Edward. He had crept up on me and Anna Catherine. He grumbled about the Lord. He'd bang the Catechism into me. Don't listen to them, I had enough. Twenty years with that man. - They want to protect me. It was me. - It was me. -It was me! - That was me! - Enough! It's usually the opposite. One approach was used when it was the opposite. - I didn't think about it. - On what? It's a case where you let fate decide who's to blame. Two farmers were accused of killing a customs officer. The villains blamed each other. It was decided to let them roll dice to see who'd die. - It's completely arbitrary. - If we prove, after all, all are guilty. - Then all should be acquitted. - I think everyone should be executed. Unless people can trust in justice they will rise up. I apologize, Chief Constable. I don't think Dĺĺdh meant what he said right now. I think Dĺĺdh let his heart speak freely for once. Someone is guilty, someone should be punished. So! Therefore, it comes to a throw. The person getting the lowest number will be judged guilty. If no one wants to admit responsibility. All right, then we'll leave it to fate. Feel no duty to start? - What happens now? - Everyone has to throw. - But I got one. - It could be you, but all have to throw. Unless your sister wants to withdraw her confession. Then we'll throw once again. We have two left. - I want to see Elof. - Who? Her son. - This way. - No. Guard. The boy will have it good now. Father wouldn't let him inside the house. He forced Elof to sleep in the stables. If he came found mother bringing porridge to the barn he hit her. I'll bear the punishment with my head held high. Especially you... You mean you are guilty. It is my penance. What really happened? - I got carried away. - And the others? My mother saw what I had done but she wasn't angry. Was he dead when you carried him out? She has no guilt in this. Was he already dead when you carried him out? Guard, go to your post. I won't accuse your mother, I want know what happened. When he was alive? Yes. Edward, he became angry? I didn't know it then, but Edward and Mrs. Ĺberg... My father caught them. He beat Edward worse than ever He couldn't speak for several days. He has no guilt, I'm guilty. Your father was guilty, he won't leave you in peace. Freund. Welcome. Welcome. Fine. Adorable. Thank you. Come in. - I wish to congratulate you. - Thank you. - Unfortunately I have no gift. - Good, I don't want any more gifts. Adlar Kreutz, welcome. Thank you very much. Not only in Poland they confuse art with pork. Dearest brothers, sisters and friends! I would like to propose a toast. My dear wife. Those of you who know me a long time know- - That I called you the first time I saw you. As the prettiest and purest woman as a man could want. I proposed immediately. You immediately said no. But I asked again and again and again and again- And you said no, no, no, no. But I continued because I knew- -That you would stand by me- And I couldn't live without you. You said yes. Since that time You are the dearest thing I have. But there are also moments When you're my worst headache. You're like an errant child, Magdalene. You defy me! You put a strain on my patience, and I allow it because... I love you. If I were to lose you my life would be incredibly poor- And meaningless. Magdalene cheers... Your faults notwithstanding. Cheers! And now a little piece in your honour. Composed for you, dear wife. Yes? I'd like to discuss one thing with you. Dĺĺdh's behaviour at the dice. I don't know how wise it is to have a district commissar who is soft. And this evening... I noticed his behaviour towards Wĺhlstedt's wife. - How do you mean? - I don't know... It's as if they shared something, a secret. It would be wise to keep him under surveillance. - You leave Dĺĺdh in peace. - I'd like to... No! Now the end of it, we can't suspect each other. Of course. It was only a suggestion. How are you? I can't do this anymore. - All this theatre. - I understand you. - Trust me. - I know. You know. I can't be commissar anymore. Why not? The rift between the world I imagine and the world I see is impossible- -It's too deep. I no longer want. If you stop now, Nordin takes over. Maybe he should. And you leave me.
