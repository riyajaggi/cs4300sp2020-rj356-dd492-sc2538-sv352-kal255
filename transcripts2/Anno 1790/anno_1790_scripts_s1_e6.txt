 Nordin is watching you. Won't you come back? I find it hard to raise a glass to a neck that must be broken. He suggests you're the king's enemy; which you aren't, but... It's so easy to be denounced. - Nordin wants very much... - To see me hang. To take your place. But it's safe. Whatever you think about this spectacle, don't turn away. It's too dangerous. Play along with it. Is that what you're doing? - Mrs. Wĺhlstedt. - Freund... The children shouldn't witness the hanging. You may teach as soon as it is over. It's time. - Where are the children? - In the kitchen.

 They should be here. - Won't we spare the children's eyes? - Spare them? Bring them here. - Dĺĺdh! - Mr Wĺhlstedt, you stand and hang? Watch over 6000 live TV channels for  less than 8 EUR - www.TvTodo.online Long live the king! Death to the tyrant! - Cheers! - The King, one with his people. For the hanging? - What is going on? - It's to be dissected. The body is mine. I have the thing. - What's happening? - I'm Dr. Brodersson. The body is of utmost importance for my experiment- - But now it's to be dissected. - What is this nonsense? - It's by His Majesty's command. - I represent science. My moulds need young, healthy meat. What a triumph. Lilja's plans were quite far advanced. Now can our monarch breathe freely, for time being. There are more enemies. Lilja was the second to believe in these crazy ideas. What? That someone other than the king should govern the country. Brotherhood and freedom. That all human life is equal although there are the rich and the poor. No, you can hear for yourself how it sounds. What a joy it was. - Do you have something to talk about? - Yes. Lilja's corpse was to be dissected. - Yes. - I wonder why. The cause of death, there is hardly any doubt. You are aware, but it's not something I like. On the contrary, but in this case, your questions will remain unanswered. Of course. Sometimes only a narrow circle around our monarch knows what's happening. Will you close the door? "remove everything that worries, away with everything that troubles the heart" From the beginning. Mrs. Wĺhlstedt. - Have you encountered something? - Yes, I have experienced something. I ran into it when I was born, since I was a woman. Education of my children is my responsibility. It... It is my only one. Suddenly it dawned on me I have no control over it either. Children shouldn't see what they don't understand. You want to break free. My words mean as much as everyone else's. I wouldn't be silent. And I beg you, never be silent. I want to hear your thoughts. If it was only you who decided that. It's not your place, if I should keep quiet. So there, children. Dĺĺdh! - Yes? - Now all hell is loose. Come along. - Can I get that? - Oh hell! Someone has killed two men and stolen Pehr Lilja's corpse. Why kill to take a corpse? - It was Lilja's supporters. - Why do you think? - Revenge, of course. - They hadn't killed the students. You have high regard for the insurgents. Nordin, excuse us a moment? Of course. What I'll tell you doesn't leave this room. Pehr Lilja was arrested and sentenced for... Plotting a conspiracy against the king. I can't go into the evidence. - Do you know who the others were? - No. Any attempt to encourage Lilja to talk, failed. Believe me, we used all possible means. They said Lilja said there was a list of names. And Lilja carried it on him wherever he went. The body was be dissected to see- - if Lilja had invented a way to hide the names on his person. Those who stole the body and wanted to prevent dissection. - It wasn't necessary to... - I have more. Pehr said this was a paper that shouldn't fall into the wrong hands. - Have you read them? - No, Mademoiselle. I haven't been bestowed the gift of reading. - I will take good care of them. - Do you know who turned him in? It's dangerous times for those who speak of freedom. - Pehr gave his life for a good cause. - In death, his corpse is cursed. And I didn't get the ring. - What ring? My fiancé's ring. It was a nice ring with an emerald. He said it would be my insurance against poverty and distress. Your loyalty won't go unnoticed. Thank you. That's opium, a good remedy for melancholy. Here you are. - You showed interest in Lilja's body. - Yes, such a body! Strong, with the power of life. Imagine being able to grow mould on him. - Mould? - Of course, mould. Mould. Mould hides many surprising secrets. With these cells I come out of nowhere. The rot before I had time to make observations. Mushrooms need human cadavers. - What was that? - Nothing. It's only rats. - It didn't sound like rats. That's it. I can't get rid of them, the only way is kill them. - Who is he? - Just a vagrant. - What are you going with him? - A few experiments. It can lead to something important. - You think he'll soon be a corpse. - If you have some luck. - How many have gone to this? - No, God forbid. All corpses had been beheaded. By whom? The executioner? Axel Roslund? Does he sell the corpses? Roslund does great service to science, nothing else. - But this time you went without. - Yes. - The body was to be dissected. - Yes. But the corpse was stolen. What do you say to that? Is that why you came? I haven't stolen anything. I am the Lord's servant, I haven't stolen anything in my entire life. It would be too great a sin. - Where are your servants? - Here. I have a kitchen housekeeper, a maid and a manservant. Soon, you'll have another one. What is your name? Godfrey Palsson, but what will I do with him? So. No vagrants. Make sure to give the groom a real food before you put him to work. Nordin, Brodersson buys corpses from the executioner. You found out. - Yes? I went in. - It was my payment. - Was it eight kronors for a hanging? - Yes, that's right. Brodersson and you get along well. - It isn't against the law. - No. But it's against common sense to make money from a dead man. What do you think? How was a corpse that you sold, stolen? I know nothing about it. There. Why was Pehr Lilja hanged? I think Lilja himself asked for it. - Why would he do that? - I only kill people under instruction. If it was Pehr Lilja's own wish to be hanged, is it possible to confirm? Yes... There ought to be here. Royal petition. Here's the letter. "Hereby, I humbly petition" - "your Majesty grant me the grace to be hung" - "And not executed with an axe. Pehr Lilja." Good. Dĺĺdh... If you saw a blind man move towards a cliff Would you stand and watch or would you intervene? I'd intervene. Any sensible person would do the same. - Who is the blind man? - You. You are playing with lives. Mr. Wĺhlstedt. Just look at you and Magdalena To understand what is between you. Death follows in the wake of the passion visible as soon as you're in the same room. Freund. Do you think Magdalena harbours the same feelings for me? It's quite obvious. You can't understand how impossible it is for me- -To stifle the feelings for Magdalena. Don't you realize the magnitude of what love can do to a man? Why do you think I set out in the war? Why? You know that. Don't think you're the only one who suffers out of love. - What's the matter? - I can't breathe. So... Does it feel better? You are so beautiful. Where are my son's remains? The body was stolen. I can't discuss that matter now. I beg you, let me bury him. If not in consecrated ground, then in the earth. - Mr Lilja. - Who are you? I work as district commissar. Come with me. This way. Mr. Wĺhlstedt. Get up. Wake up. It wasn't his fault, it was those he ran with... the traitors. - Do you know what it was? - How could he be so blind? He'd probably argue you were blind. Now remind you of him. Who were they? He held me off. I stayed outside. We became insolvent, I couldn't protect him. - It was my fault. - Don't you know who he spent time with? Come in. I saw you on the square at Lilja's execution. - We planned to get married. - You were there with Miss Raxelius. - I don't know who she is. - I saw you. How do you know her? I don't know her; it was Pehr who knew her. Do you know others he hung out with around town? - No thanks. - I know nothing of Pehr's movements. Did he use to keep things here? What would they be? - Papers. - No. Or yes... His talk about the king. - Do you have it somewhere? - I burned it. Was there anything on his body? With written characters or words? He carried on him ...? Pehr is dead, let him rest in peace. - You haven't heard. - What? Two students were to carry the body to Uppsala, but they were assaulted. The students are dead; and your fiancé's body is gone. Who would do such a thing? I'm sorry. Pehr had a ring. An engagement one. It was worth a lot of money. No one could touch it; not even me- despite the celebration of our engagement. Thank you. The commissar... Sit down. When you brought Lilja to the gallows, did he wear a ring? - I don't know, it could be. - Think about it. - It's possible. - Many people were in the square. - Where Pehr Lilja's supporters there? - Not that I know. - You didn't behave differently? - No. What do you do when you don't hang people? - I 'm a saddler. - A saddler? - What did you do after the hanging? - I took a few cups. Someone murdered to get Lilja's corpse. Who? Brodersson? You can't believe it was him. I don't know. I swear, I don't know. - Why does she sit in the pillory? - Don't ask. - What had she done wrong? - You heard me. - Why is she there? - You heard the pastor's words. A marriage, ordained by God, demands unswerving loyalty. We need to go home. Hello there! It's the law to use a lamp after dark. - Dĺĺdh, accompany me. - I'm going to the police. Let me drive you there. - This night journey is dangerous. - Things have to be done in the dark. You are chasing the same thing as me. Let's hear it. What are you looking for? There is a list. If the list falls into the wrong hands- the people on the list risk having the same fate as Pehr Lilja. So? Your name is probably on the list. - Your name may also be there. - Nothing identifies me as a conspirator. No, some people stand by their ideas, others are silent. I don't applaud the existing order- -But I don't believe in bloodshed. Really? But you killed my brother. No. No! From now on I don't care whether you or someone else shot him. You can enter the heart of power. You can be the determining factor- if people are allowed to continue in the dark or into a new light. Do you sleep well at nights when you know you serve those in power? Above all is the rooster, the demon's enemy. Previously, he was a sacred bird, because he sits on the church tower. The woman at church was held fast in the demon's grip. So said father. Man is a weak, therefore, she needs God. What did the woman do to be punished? Mrs. Wĺhlstedt? Fornication was her sin. - Did she steal something? - She cast shame on her husband. She dishonoured their name and the name of God. - She broke her promise to God. - What kind of promise? What God joined together isn't made for man to break up. Good evening, Mrs. Wĺhlstedt and Freund. It's late. The lesson is over, you can go to Johanna. - I'm looking for the Chief Constable. - He isn't home, you may come back. Freund. - The lesson is over. - I'm waiting for Dĺĺdh. If there's anything you want to say, Freund, do so now or go away. I know... I'm concerned. I mean, I'm worried. - It would pain me... - If? Good evening. Mr. Dĺĺdh, I want to be left alone. Did I do the opposite? I can't be alone with you, never again. I want you to go. You are welcome here when my husband is home. Dĺĺdh! Are you hungry? Opium. I can't be alone with you. Freund! - How is your husband? - I'm a widow since March. Is he your friend? He seems to need your help. I wasn't completely in my senses. That sometimes happens. It looks like you need this. - Cheers. - Cheers. Don't take it so seriously. I was struck by your escapades. Do you want some good advice? Get a wife, Dĺĺdh. Provide stability for their lives. - I'm convinced. - With an honourable wife you'd avoid... Yes, you know what I mean. The itch of course sucks. "Au revoir." Magdalena? Couldn't you find- A respectable and charming woman for Dĺĺdh? He isn't particularly rich, but his face is attractive. - I can try... - But he's respectable. - Don't you know someone who'd suit him? - Please don't... Dĺĺdh's love life really doesn't interest me. You should think about it. - Adolfsson was murdered. - What? See. The chair! Incipient body stains. It must have happened last night. - The throat is cut with... - We can see well the throat is cut! Do you know who could have done it? The city is perfectly lousy with pigs. What did he do before? The last time he guarded detainees here. He watched Lilja. He watched Lilja. When Lilja was arrested before the hanging, Adolfsson was guarding him? Yes. Who came here and picked up Pehr Lilja? The executioner as usual. Roslund. Roslund. The Customs House has enhanced surveillance. Mr. Wĺhlstedt! Roslund is also dead. Murdered. - What? - The throat was cut. The culprit is Pehr Lilja. - Pehr Lilja? - He survived. A mock execution. - What? - Lilja lives. I know where he is. - This is the whole corps. - Gather the city guard. Open! - Step aside! - What are you doing here? - We are looking for a murderer. - At my home? Come in, Chief Constable. District commissar. Nordin, up stairs. - You're pitiful. - He's killed four. And how many died in the war? If you dig your own grave your end will soon be here. This applies both to the king as to his lackeys, district commissar. Pst! What are you doing up so early? Keep the pot warm. You'll come back for dinner? I have more questions to ask. Wait a minute! Good day, Madame. Good day yourself, Freund. I was surprised When I received your invitation to dinner. It was a surprise, a happy one. - Dinner with one. - Oh! - Well, we'll have company? - It is my master. He should be here now. He's a very pleasant gentleman, I assure you. - Can I pour you a drink? - Yes. - While we're waiting. - Yes. Thank you. I knew you were alive. So you are Mr. Dĺĺdh. District Inspector. I've heard a lot about you. - Your ring holds many secrets. - It teaches you not to spread further. Open, but don't let anyone in. Mr. Lilja, good day. - I... I need to talk to you. - It doesn't suit right now. - Who did this to my son? - You can't be here, you have to go. Let him. God in hell! Aren't you happy to see me? I couldn't die. I have too much left to accomplish. - What will you do? - Free the commissar. Please, father, I can't allow it. - Who are you? - The one you brought me up to be. Your fine master seems a long time coming. What shall we do in the meantime, do you think? - Madame isn't understood. - I understand men's intentions. They're often difficult to guess. No. No. My master goes about in suffering and anguish. He dreams of a woman he can't get. I've been asked... by God to help him from the dangers of temptation. Another woman might be able to... You're a good man, Freund. But you don't know a lot about women. Cheers for that. I don't understand. I saw you die. I saw it with my own eyes. You saw what he wanted you to see. He had a contract with the executioner. Roslund's device just made it look like he was hanged. But you didn't know you were to be dissected. So when you killed the students. - Then you learned it from the witnesses. - Is it true? Did you kill innocent people? You've never understood. The fight has its price. The king took everything away from us - And yet you persist to be his submissive lapdog! Stop! He's your father! You can sit here and regret you've betrayed your friends. Father, you will see. You'll be proud of my courage. You're a murderer. But what's one life compared to all the suffering coming from oppression? - Four lives. - Yes, there we have it. Precisely, the idea holds people back. The struggle comes at a price, you must understand that, promise? Yes. God! You're not a good man. - Promise! - We don't have time. You must get us loose. - Where is he? - Far away. He intends to escape from Haman's Cape. Mr. Lilja, you must alert the city guard. Haman's cape. They'll help you over the border and then off to France. Farewell, my friend. Thank you for your courage. "Allez." - Lilja! - Come on, Dĺĺdh! It's over. They're too far away. Stay away for your own sake. Lilja! Quiet! Not a sound to. You're silent Always when you should be talking. I ask you. The bullet could have killed you. You won't go anywhere! - You're a murderer! - I just spared your life. Come with me. So I can again see the gallows? I can bargain my life for the names in the ring. But it would be unjust. Do you want to create change? Then take your punishment. It'll create a stir. Call out what you want to change, inform people about freedom. You could be the spark so the fire will spread. Now, if you believe in word so much, why are you so quiet, then? How easy is it to kill when the mind is cold? What is your accusation? I killed a corpse? You serve your king well, very well. Where is my horse? - Where is my horse? - It's over there. Get it. Dĺĺdh... - Don't let me interrupt. - Will you meet Madame Ulfberg? It'll make me happy one day when it suits you both. Good night. Freund... Freund... Freund.
