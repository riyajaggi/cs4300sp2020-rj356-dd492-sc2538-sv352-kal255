 Rescue Me (2004â€“2011): Season 3, Episode 4 - Sparks - full transcript 
 After tending to an overturned bus and saving the lives of multiple children, the Reverend Al Sharpton publicly denounces the FDNY for ignoring the needs of the black community by choosing to rescue the bus on the way to help a black man with chest pains. The station, and the entire community are responding in interesting ways. Sean confronts Tommy about his relationship with Maggie and Tommy warns him that his sister is trouble. Franco continues his relationship with Alicia, and Tommy and Sheila's relationship takes an interesting turn, especially when Tommy informs her that he will be making a deposit the next day, and not at a bank. Chief Reilly takes the job at the bar, and finds it difficult and tiring. The guys at the house take advantage of his vulnerability by playing practical jokes on him.

I, for one, am calling For a full and thorough Investigation. He's kidding, right? Every once in a while you see Something going down and you Have to make a snap judgment Call. In this case, it was a man In distress. Chest pains versus A bus load of kids. And I made The call. I didn't stop to think What color the kids were. Black, White, green. They're kids.
