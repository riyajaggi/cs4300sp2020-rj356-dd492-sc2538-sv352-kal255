 - And now ladies and gentlemen, moving right along. Here's the terpsichorean artistry of Dan Rowan and the songs of the ever-lovely Dick Martin. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) - Well hello again, and a very hearty welcome to the Laugh In. - Yeah, I guess it's gonna be a ball tonight, huh? - Hey you're pretty chipper this evening. - Well, isn't everyday I get to be on a show with John Wayne (laughing). - John Wayne? - He's my hero. - Well he's not on the show tonight. - Backed out again? - Hey now, come on, you're gonna have to stop doin' that, people are gonna think that it's his fault. Now he wasn't suppose to be here. Leave him alone, he's a nice guy. - Well anyone who kisses horses all day can't be all bad. - John Wayne doesn't kiss horses. - You didn't see the end of the picture. - Well, forget about John Wayne for just a minute. Hey, now that we've been on a few weeks, you gettin' much reaction to the show? - You know it's amazing, last Tuesday about 15 or 20 people stopped me. - Oh really, what'd they say? (whispering) You're suppose to check those things before you leave the house. (audience laughing) - Well it was mighty embarrassing. - Yeah, well we're gonna have a lot a fun, hey, we got Don Adams tonight. - Hey, Don, I saw Don the other day. - Where? - Over at the phone company. - What was he doin'? - Buyin' a pair a shoes. - Buyin' a pair a shoes. (audience laughing) Listen, oh and Pam Austin's, isn't she pretty? - I guess so. You know if John Wayne ever saw her, he'd forget about that horse (laughing). - Yeah, I think you're right. - You kiss her, you don't get a mouth full a oats. (laughing) (audience laughing) - And of course we have the regular bunch, and The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's on here tonight. - And Danny Thomas. - There you go again, now they're not gonna see Danny Thomas tonight. - Well they certainly are, his show follows ours. - Oh, you're right. - See. - You're right, it does. Hey Arte. - Hi Arte. - Ladies and Gentlemen, this is one of our regular cast, Arte Johnson. (audience applauding) What in the world are you doin' Arte? - I'm ready for the shaving commercial. - I didn't know we had a shaving commercial. - We don't. - We don't? - No. - Sandy. (audience laughing) - Well, movin' right along now, you're such a nice group we'd like to invite you to a party. - I'll drink to that. - I thought you would. Come on, it's up this way. - Let's go, come on. (audience laughing) (big band music) - There's no such thing as a bad boy, just a lot of nice boys doing disgusting things. (audience laughing) (big band music) - My instinct about people is uncanny. Now take that man over there, something tells me he's not to be trusted. - Which one? - The one who's tearing the clothes off the hostess. (audience laughing) (big band music) - I was wearing turtlenecks long before they became fashionable. (audience laughing) (big band music) - Oh I'm not surprised that Frank and Mia broke up, I'm always been against mixed marriages. (audience laughing) - Roddy, why are you British so attached to the royal family? - Well I think it's the tradition and the pageantry. It's the life's blood of every true Englishman. Besides which, they do amuse our tourists. (audience laughing) (big band music) - After all this country was founded on a revolution, and we think it's time for another. Provided of course the government will subsidize it. (audience laughing) (big band music) - It is said, the heart of the artichoke, and the seed of the persimmon, shall never find peace in the jelly of the guava. (audience laughing) (big band music) - Poor Boris, he's working so hard lately. All day long he's at the CIA, then at night he's up in the attic with the shortwave radio. (laughing) (big band music) (audience laughing) - Oh I've thought about marriage, but I prefer the single life. What was good enough for my father's good enough for me. (audience laughing) (big band music) - I just love tennis, I wouldn't miss the finals at Forest Lawn for anything. (audience laughing) (big band music) - On the other hand, that man over there is obviously a bigot, a racist, and a hate monger. - How can you tell? - Well look at that sign he's carrying, it says I'm a bigot, a racist, and a hate monger. (audience laughing) (big band music) - I believe religion should keep abreast of the times, and the news, the Herald Examiner. (audience laughing) (big band music) - Just think, if Jonathan Rivers divorced Spring Byington, and married Joanie Sommers in the Fall he'd be a man for all seasons, uh. (audience laughing) - You know Roddy, one thing, when Americans get to England they are aggravating. - Oh on the contrary, I think in England they can be very charming, it's over here they're rather aggravating. (audience laughing) (big band music) - My father's idea of a bum trip is a weekend in Cleveland. (audience laughing) (big band music) - It is said the man who burneth incense within the confines of his own room shall never suffer the loss of a pomegranate. (audience laughing) (big band music) - Oh Boris and I have the most vile and political arguments. I say the defense of California begins in Saigon, but Boris says, "Better red than Shirley Temple black." (audience laughing) (big band music) - I've got nothing against getting married, but the way I figure it, why trade a headache for an upset stomach? (audience laughing) (big band music) - Now look at that couple in the corner, you'll never convince me they're married. - Which ones? - Over there, that priest standing talking to that nun. (audience laughing) (big band music) (audience applauding) (fast-paced, whimsical music) (audience laughing) - Fore! (audience laughing) - Merry Christmas to all my readers. - My name is Robin Hood. I rob from the rich, and I give to the poor. - Really? I'm a Republican myself. (audience laughing) Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me... - And now folks, it's sock it to me time. Sock it to me, sock it to me... (water splashing) Ha-ha. Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me... (water splashing) (audience laughing) - Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me. - Sock it to me? (fast-paced, whimsical music) (audience laughing) - Fore! (telephone ringing) - Hello. Oh, it's for you. - Waiter, waiter. There's fly in my soup. - I'll fetch a fork, sir. (audience laughing) - Would you believe Mister and Missus Jim Smith? - Darling are you sure you wanna go through with this? (audience laughing) (bouncy flute music) (whirring) - Well folks out there... - Whoop. (laughing) Why can't he cheer up? (audience laughing) - Well sports fans, moving right along now, it's time to spotlight the stars of tomorrow today, Laugh In's new talent time.

He's an invisible man. - I don't believe I've ever seen anything quite like that. - Well how could you, I said he was invisible. - Well is he here now? - Well, come on now. I'll bring him out for you. - Okay. - All right, ladies and gentlemen, I ask all of you to join me in welcoming Harold Nub. - Harold Nub? (audience applauding) - Good evening, Mr. Nub. - Good evening, Mr. Martin. - I thought you said he was invisible. - Oh I am invisible. - You're not, I can see you standin' there. - I am invisible, you can't see me. - See, I told you. Tell me Harold, how long have you been invisible? - Well, since I was 12 years old. One morning I woke up and I wasn't there. - Hm. - Obviously. - Absolutely fantastic. And you've never seen yourself since? - [Harold] No, never since, no. - Isn't that amazing. - Well we certainly wanna thank you Mr. Nub for showing up. - I'm over here, Mr. Rowan. - Oh (laughing). (audience laughing) - There you go. Lots a people make that mistake, constantly amusing. (audience applauding) - I told you they'd love Mr. Nub. - Well, you've done it again, boy.

He's doin' it in the total darkness, he can't see anything. - Well I know, but I still... - Well that's our new talent for tonight, folks. I hope you all tune in next week when the fickle finger of fate points at more stars of tomorrow. - The what? - The fickle finger of fate, what would you call it? - Well I might call it a... - The, maybe the fickle finger of fortune. - No, but I might call it... - How 'bout the fortunate fickle finger of fate? - Now cut that out! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) - This is your off-stage announcer, reminding you that this is your off-stage announcer. (audience laughing) - (screaming) Look, there's one a those cute guards, get a picture, Henry (laughing). I'll just fix his, excuse me a minute, may I fix your hat? Give us a smile for the camera.

(audience laughing) - Yes, but I... - And you can park a tank anywhere. - Anywhere? - Who's gonna ticket a tank? (audience laughing) - That's true, but they're pretty expensive. Can the average citizen afford one a these? - Are you kidding? You don't buy one, you rent. Don't buy, rent, rent a tank. Just put a little down then let 'em try to collect the rest. (audience laughing) - Well that'd be a problem all right. Well what happens when the lease runs out? - Well who's gonna repossess a tank? - Well I think you could get stuck with a lot of old tanks. - Oh no we won't, we've already got that figured out. You see when the tanks wear out, we'll just take them down to Tijuana, and sell them for cabs. (audience laughing) - Very interesting.

If your temperature was 118 you'd now be on your way to a better, to a happier world, where everyone does just as they wish. - Las Vegas? - Now, come on, you must admit your temperature wasn't 118. - Well I remember it distinctly. I put the temperature in my mouth... - You put the thermometer in your mouth... - The glass thing, the glass thing. I put it in my mouth, and then I took it out and I stirred my coffee, and I read it. - So your coffee was 118. - That's it. - You know, if you had a bad cold and it wasn't gettin' any better, you'd go see a doctor, right? - No, I'd have a couple drinks. - Well now alcohol isn't a cure for anything. - I'll drink to that. (audience laughing) - What if you woke up in the middle of the night with a sharp pain, then you'd go screamin' for a doctor. - I would not, I'd use my grandmother's old cure. - Your grandmother had an old cure for sharp pains? - Well I guess so. - No kiddin'? - Oh yeah, first of all you get a squirrel and you put it in a sack. - You get a squirrel. - Yeah, put a squirrel in a sack, and you put a three foot piece a string on it, and you whirl it around your head 37 times counterclockwise. And then you jump up and down on a snow shoe and sing sweet Sue. (audience laughing) - And that's a cure for sharp pains? - You're kidding, I gotta try that. (audience laughing) - What you do, you go see a specialist. - Well, my doctor's a specialist. - What does he specialize in? - Cigarette commercials. (laughing) (audience laughing) I bumped into him just the other day. - [Dan] Yeah, what'd he say? - Take two aspirins and call me in the morning. - And call me in the morning. (audience laughing) - You know you're makin' fun of a group of people that work night and day to keep you in perfect health. - Me? - That's right. - Why? - And every day they come up with somethin' new. Look what's going on today, transplants. - There's nothing new about that. - Wha'da you mean there's nothing new about it, it's brand new. - Ah, come on, a doctor in our neighborhood did one years and years ago. - A transplant? - Yeah, you see he was in a garage having his car fixed, you see. And this woman came driving in and she got out of her car and all of a sudden she had a seizure. - She had a seizure? - Yeah, right there in the garage. So he had to think quickly. - [Dan] Yeah. - Yeah, he operated on her. - What'd he do? - Well he replaced her kidney with an old carburetor. (audience laughing) - Wait a minute, the man put a carburetor in a woman for a kidney? - Well it was an emergency. - How did it work out? - Well, she's a little slow on hills, um... (audience laughing) - Oh come one, for crying out loud. - Her husband complains she's a little cold getting started in the morning. - All right. (audience laughing) Will you stop with that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. You know what a doctor'd say if you told him a thing like that? - Take two aspirins and call me in the morning. (audience laughing) (fast-paced, energetic music) (drum pounding) - Times have changed in the medical field. Years ago, strikes were unthinkable for nurses and doctors. Today, it's not uncommon at all. - We're here in the waiting room of Burbank General Hospital in beautiful downtown Burbank, with head nurse, Edith Head. The conditions here today are appalling. These people have been waiting for hours, no one to help, beds in the corridors. No fresh linens, meals are late, I don't even see a doctor in sight. It's appalling. - Well I couldn't agree with you more. But just think what it's gonna be like when the strike starts. (audience laughing) (fast-paced, energetic music) - Mod Mod World takes another look at the medical profession. - Mr. Frisbee, could I have one word with you? - Yeah. - Well it's very kind of you to come over here. I guess driving an ambulance is pretty exciting work, isn't it. - Ooohhh, it sure is, you know, 'cause you go careening through traffic, zipping from lane to lane, running through red lights, cars, bus, persons running at you at all sides, it's really exciting, it's exciting. - Taking all those chances just to get to the patient as soon as possible. - No, no, that's after I get the patient. Goin' there you gotta drive slow 'cause you can't be too careful you might get killed in an accident. - Oh, well when you arrive at the emergency, what is the first thing you do to help a patient? - Well, the first thing I do is I help 'em to fill out the form. - Oh, the form. - Yes, you can't do anything unless you fill out the form first. - I see, well what if he's in critical condition? - Oh, then you gotta work real fast, 'cause if I don't get that form filled out I'm in real trouble, you know. - I see. All right, so you've filled out the form, then what? - Well, well, then comes the most important part of my job. - What's that? - That's get the money. $22 plus eight for the siren, $2 for the... (audience laughing) (dramatic music) - What medicine really boils down to is a war against the germ. Tonight, we meet a noble, dedicated man who is fighting that war. Ladies and gentlemen, Doctor Edward Flowers. (audience applauding) - This is my life's work. A pill, containing a miniature, colored TV camera. Once this is inside my patient, I'll be able to see what the germs are doing. Swallow this. - Damn the penicillin, full speed ahead. Fire when you see the whites of their corpuscles. (audience laughing) - Oh where do you want these mumps, Mon General? (phone ringing) - What's that? Hold on a minute. Listen, they're short on chicken pox at the front, do we have any? - [Man Carrying Mumps] Ah, yes sir. - Well don't just stand there, drop your mumps and grab your pox. (audience laughing) - Sir. - Your light fell off, chief. (audience laughing) - That was strange. - Emergency, sir. A capsule just hit the cough control center. Look, there's the first tiny time pill now. (audience laughing) - Those butchers. All right, all units attack. UA's and flu germs, attack. Move out, charge. Commit the reserves. Fire, fire, fire.
