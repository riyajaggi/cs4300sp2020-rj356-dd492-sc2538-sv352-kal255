That's in the past you know. Now here's, um, - Dan. - Dan. - 1703, on returning to Moscow from the honeymoon, the czar and his bride announced their immediate separation. The couple refused to discuss the honeymoon, but it was noted that he referred to her as Catherine the Great, while she called him Ivan the Terrible.

Are you ready? - [Group] Yes. - All right then, heads it's legal, tales it isn't. - And now it's time for a Laugh-In news extra. Take it away somebody. - Many people suspect that our news is doctored in what is called the national interest. For a better understanding of the credibility gap, we take you to the official press office in Washington. - Hey Sam, listen to this bulletin. - Yeah. - An American destroyer accidentally hit and sank a Russian fishing vessel 75 miles off the coast of Labrador, 15 Russian fisherman were injured. - That's a good item. I think we can do something with that. How many Russians did you say were injured? - 15. - 15, Joe, that could be serious, we better make it 10 Russians. - How about five Russians? - Make it a couple. - A couple of ours. - Couple of ours? - Why not? - In that case then, we might as well make it five. - Make it 10, - Look, we might as well then leave it at the original number, 15, that way it's original, nobody will be bugged by it. - 15 American fisherman injured. Boy, that's terrible. - Where uh, where was this Russian boat anyway? - 75 miles off the coast of Labrador. - Labrador, nobody knows where that is. Make it New England. - 75 miles off the coast of Massachusetts. - Good, now round it out to 50 miles, 'cause I think that'll read better. - Maybe even 25. - Let's not quibble. Put them a mile off of Boston Harbor. - A mile, one mile. Boy those are fool Russians who don't know they're playing with dynamite, do they? - Wait a minute. - What? - Just a minute, wouldn't people see a Russian boat one mile off shore? - Sure, somebody would spot it. - Not if it was a submarine. - Of course, it had to be a sub. But tell me, how could an American destroyer ram a sub? - It couldn't. Ya know what? It's gotta be the other way around. Their sub hit our fishing boat. - Our fishing boat? - Of course, how else could 15 American fishermen be injured? - Lousy Ruskies! - How come the sub didn't see them? I mean, don't forget, a sub has a periscope. - That's right. An accident like that just couldn't happen. - Of course, you mean it wasn't an accident? - Of course not. They did it on purpose. - Butchers, dirty butchers! - Read it back to me. - All right, today a Russian submarine deliberately ram and sank a helpless American fishing boat one mile off Boston Harbor. 15 American fishermen are in critical condition. You know something? Those Russians must be out of their minds to think they can get away with a thing like this! - You're right.

(girls cheering randomly) Here we are in Mexico City Ain't nowhere not sunny and pretty You'll get in, just mention our names, Laugh-In for the Olympic games. Ole! - Many countries at the Olympics are unable to participate in all events, so they usually specialize in one sport. For instance the country of Croatia has long been known for it's fine basketball team, and tonight we have their coach and three of their star players. And now it's a real pleasure for me to introduce to you the former All-American, many time All-Pro, the great Elgin Baylor. Coach, leasure to meet you sir.

I wondered if you would mind demonstrating that running style for our television audience. - (speaks German) Uh, si, of course. - All right good, okay, on your mark, - I'll give the orders around here. On my mark, - Very interesting. - (Speaks German) (gun firing) (counts in German) (60s music) - As you may have read, there's been some problems in recent years with Russian winners of women's events turning out to be men. As a result, the Olympic committee as devised a sex test which the female athletes will be required to take. - This is an outrage. To take sex test is slur on my, my integrity, my country and my fenimity, now I ask you is this the leg of a man? I want results of test. - Well, Mrs. Petrovitch, I have good news and bad news. - Tell me bad news, I am strong. - I'm afraid I'll have to disqualify you, you're definitely a man. - Oh, and what is good news? - Congratulations, you're pregnant.
