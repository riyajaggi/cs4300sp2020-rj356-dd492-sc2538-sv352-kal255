 Good evening, we are very happy that you have tuned in this first show of our new series. Right? - Yes, and I'd like to add a further note if I may. In that each time that we have said these things, we have hoped that the noon is that has worn off has come through feeling that the long arm has gone through and brought back one that we could slip under the door. (audience laughs) - Yeah, well I couldn't have said it better myself. Hey how bout that, your name's in big lights up there on that marquee. - So's mine. - Yeah. That's pretty good huh, Rowan and Martin's Laugh In. - Starring Bonnie and Clyde. - That's next door. - Ooh. - Yeah. Yep NBC took the one hour special we did last September, now we're gonna do 13 in a row. - We can't do 13 hours. - Why not? - We'll be here all night. - No not every night every night. We do them every Monday night, once a week you know. - Ho ho ho oh. - Sure. You are happy about it aren't ya? - I certainly can. - Yeah well why, I think you should say something. - All right I, if I may I'd like to say that I'm very pleased and gratified to know that I will be on the air every Monday night. - Well I think you should say that. - Thank you. We'll be very pleased - No I don't mean - And gratified to know - you should say it again. I think that once was just fine. But you know, when you realize, when you think just for a second you know, there's gonna, every Monday night millions of people, millions right now watching you. What do you say to that? - If each and every one of you could send in one dollar. - No no no. (audience applauds and laughs) You can't say that, it's illegal. - How bout a dime. - No no no. You can't, you can't say that. - You can't shoot a guy for trying. - You cannot get anywhere by being dishonest. - Oh how bout Bonnie and Clyde, their name's twice as big as ours. - No no no. You're off on a tangent. - I had one of those, but it sprung a leak. - No no, I mean you're going in a different direction. This show is going to be a different show. It's not a regular variety show. You realize that you now have a chance, one hour a week, you can do anything, you can say anything you want to say. - You're kidding. - Anything that you wanna say. - You'll get a kick out of this one then. There was a... Anything the censors and NBC and the sponsors will allow you to say. - That does cut down the odds doesn't it. (audience laughs) - It narrows it a little bit. But there are a lot of subjects you can talk about like history. You like history? - Yeah. - You wanna talk about history? - Alright. - You know what happened in 1492? - No, but there was a great party in 1537 upstairs. - Oh, well why don't we go to that one. - You wanna go? - Come along with us.

(audience laughs) - You know I could have had the lead in I Spy, but they gave it to Robert Culp. (audience laughs) - It's not that Ronald Reagan dislikes education, it's just that he's not fanatic about it. (audience laughs) - You know I always say before two people can love each other, you really have to like each other. (audience laughs) - Boris says real rejection is trying to sell Support Your Local Police bumper stickers at Berkeley. Isn't he silly? (audience laughs) - As the Ram Chungulahoran once said, "When the lamb lieth down with the lion, it is then and then only, the pigeon will sit on the arm of the idol." (audience laughs) - When I asked Harry whether he'd rather watch Mission Impossible or kiss me, he said "What's the difference?" (audience laughs) - I say we ought to get bingo out of the supermarkets and back into the churches where it belongs.

(audience laughs) (audience applauds) - Moving along musically, here is the lovely Dick Martin with trees. (trumpet sting) (audience laughs) - The Feather, by Henry Gibson. The feather is a wonderful thing, without it the bird could not fly. In addition, it warms the old warblers and protects them when they are hiding. The police like the feather too because it helps them control the traffic. Well take for example the streets, which would be a mess if birds started walking. But most of all, it is cheerful and gay. If it were not for the feather, we would be without fluff. (audience laughs) When you're down and out Lift up your head and shout I'm down and out Oh I'm begging (audience laughs) (cheery music) (audience laughs) - Sock it to me. - And now folks, it's sock it to em time.

The very basis of man's happiness in today's world and Dick I'd like you to pay particular attention to this subject tonight. - Sounds interesting, I'm kinda sorry I missed it. - Well you haven't missed it, we're just getting ready to do it. - Oh. - Yeah. Now I want you to try and, now pay attention will you, now try and think of the American family as democracy in its purest form. Okay. - Yeah, - The father is the President of the family, the mother is the Vice-President. - I get it yeah. Now there was Hubert Humphrey is the father of his country, - That's right. - And the mother of his family. - No, Hubert Humphrey is the Vice-President of the country. - Well according to you then, Mrs Humphrey is the father of her family. - No you're not getting it this way. Let's start at the beginning. - Alright, good evening ladies and gentlemen- - No no. (audience laughs) Now look, family life began in America when a handful of pilgrims landed in a small boat and today they are 200 million strong. - How'd they get here? - In a small boat. - I'd like to get a nice girl, a small boat and fool around a little in it. - When you think of it, 200 million people living in happy families, while you go your wasted way along. - Well it's not wasted. - Well it is wasted, you have no-one to see to your comfort, no-one to bring you your slippers you- - I got a dog. - Yeah but you have no-one to tuck you in at night, and kiss you goodnight and cuddle closer. - I got a dog. - It's not really the same thing. Some day you're gonna have to realize that a man is only really happy in the bosom of his family. - Hey, I'll drink to that. - I want you to, can you get a picture in your mind. Picture this. You're with a woman you love. - Has she got a small boat? - Now this is a very, very special woman. - She's got a motorboat huh? (audience laughs) - Wait a minute, you're in there with her. Beautiful woman, special woman. Before you know it. (Dick laughs) Marriage. (Dick imitates vomiting) You started your family. - I have, in a boat? - Yes. Before long, before long you'll hear the pitter patter of little feet around your house. - Mickey Rooney's coming to dinner? - No. I just don't, I don't see how you can go along the same route. Why don't you change your routine, every night of your life it's a different girl, going from one party to the next, whooping it up and you think you're having a good time. - Yeah isn't that silly? - But you're missing half the fun. - They opened a new place? (audience laughs) - No they didn't open a new place, I'm trying to tell you you have, I, it it really, the mind fairly boggles at the dismal prospects that face you. I can see a long lonely vista for you. All alone, when the other families are gathered around the hearth-side, celebrating Christmas with their children and their grand-children, the sound of Christmas carols fill the air. What are we gonna hear from your house? Row row row your boat (audience laughs) But seriously folks. The cornerstone of the American family is the mother. What is the mother? To help answer this question, let's talk to the lady recently voted Mother of the Year. And now we take you to our man in Alaska, take it away Dan Rowan. - Dan Rowan here, I'm seated in the igloo living room of Mrs Nanette Umlock, the Mother of the Year. May I call you Nanette of the North? - Mush. (audience laughs) - Listen for the benefit of our viewing audience, exactly where are we? - Oh we're right here in suburban Scagarack. We moved here a few years ago from Nome. - Do you prefer it here? - Well there's no place like Nome. (audience laughs) That's a local joke. - Yeah I guessed it must have been. How does it feel to be the Mother of the Year, the first Mother of the Year from the North Pole? - Oh Harvey's not Polish, he was born right here in Alaska. - [Dan] No I mean, you have 24 children. - Maybe Harvey is Polish. (audience laughs) - 24 children, that must be some kind of a record isn't it? - Not here in Alaska, the nights are six months long. Dumb dumb. - You know that jerky's terrible. Nanette when you were named the Mother of the Year, the judges said something about your cooking. They spoke very highly of your cooking skills. - Well I do have a way with whale. - Well it shouldn't be too difficult. - Have you ever tried to defrost one? (audience laughs) - What do you do for entertainment? - Well we just sit around and chew the fat. (audience laughs) - This is Mother of the Year with 24 kids, you have any advice for the young women of America? - Yeah. Don't rub noses with the first guy who comes along. (audience laughs) - Say it's getting rather dark, I think I'd better be getting along. - Oh I'm afraid you've missed the last sleigh. Would you like to stay overnight with us? - [Dan] Well that's very kind of you but I thought you just said that the nights are six months long. - Mush. (audience laughs) - Right back to you Dick. (audience applauds) (jaunty music sting) (groovy music) In the area of family life, Hollywood has become more broad minded than ever. This is evident in such movies as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner where an integrated marriage is portrayed for the first time. We'd like to show you a scene from the sequel which is now in production. (easy listening music) (cups banging) - I'm getting fed up with this. Fed up. Your mother treats me like dirt. - What? - I said your mother treats me like dirt. - My mother? I thought she was your mother. (audience laughs) It's a mod mod world, A mod mod world It's a mod mod world. - If it's true that children learn by imitation, then so do families and where better to look for that good example than at America's present first family. Not so long ago... (twinkling noise) - Daddy. Daddy. (President mumbles) Mr President. It's me Daddy. (audience laughs) No it's your daughter. (President mumbles) Well it's three o'clock in the morning. (President mumbles) Well Daddy it's the only time I could talk to you. I've got great news for you. (President mumbles) No Daddy your popularity hasn't gone up, it's not that. I found myself a man. I'm getting married. - Well come on in, we'll talk about it. - Daddy I met him at the Young Republican's dance. (audience laughs) - Daddy, I've got to talk to you. My husband doesn't like my chili. - Come on in and we'll talk about it. - Daddy, what does Mama put into your chili? - Ah Mr President, Mr President. - The President recognizes a senior senator from Illinois, if you wouldn't mind Everett. - Mr President I know it's three o'clock in the morning, but I must discuss something. Mr President you must admit that as a statesmen, I have made quite a record for myself. - I know you have Everett, I bought two of your record albums myself. Come on in and we'll talk about it. - Mr Dirkson, do you know what goes into chili? - A lot of ex-Nazis from Germany. - Mr President? - Oh it's you Bobby. How's your brother Teddy getting on? - He's out getting over the headboards, here he comes now. The kids are right behind him. Yeah come on kids, bring the football. - [Teddy] Never been in a huddle in bed before. - [Bobby] Now move over there please. - [President] Everett, would you mind moving over there. Bobby would you sit over there, Teddy would you, Lyndon don't, my fellow Americans, it is with a heavy heart that I must ask you to get the football out of my pajamas. - [Married Daughter] Bobby, do you know what goes into chili? - [Bobby] Several ex-Nazis from Germany. - [Everett] I already told them that. (children shouting) - [President] Now why don't you all kinda quiet down. (audience applauds) A mod, mod world - The main concern of every American family is the children.
