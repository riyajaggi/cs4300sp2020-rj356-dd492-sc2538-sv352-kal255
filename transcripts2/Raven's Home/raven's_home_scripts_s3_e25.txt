 "Raven's Home" was filmed in front of a live studio audience. All in the fam in the house say, "Yeah!" Yeah. - What are you up to, micro machine? - Yeah, you figure out who you're gonna write your big Peanut Profile column about? Huh, Levi? Huh? Huh? There are a few possibilities, but I can't find anyone with that pizazz. We're right here, bruh. Uh, why is this happening?

 You remember that MeGram video I submitted to Psy-Key for their big contest to become their next influencer? I really want to say yes. Well, I won! Yes, Psy-Key picked me to sponsor! I've already got 500 new followers, and it's only been like 10 minutes! Yo, that's amazing! Their limited edition shoes are fire. I prefer their floral sports line. What? It breathes more freely than cotton. What? I'm a tastemaker. The best part is Psy-Key is all about giving back. So, for every item you buy, they donate the same item to a country in need. I get to be an influencer for a company that's ethically on point.

That's us. Episode Title: "In-Shoe-encer" Aired on: April 26, 2020 Okay, just-just move it right there. Come on, Serena, come on, girl. Ow! Oh, Venus! Venus! Come on, girl! Serena's doing all the work here. It's just you, me, and a really huge deadline. Work with me. Hey, Rae. Listen, ever since you broke your wrist, I've been extra careful lately, you know, watching every... every little step, yeah? - I get it, Chels, I get it. - Okay. And we're good! I brought you that gold lamé you wanted for that dress you're making. Actually, that's for the next dress I'm making for the grand opening of Your Best Dressed Life! Oh! You mean that strapless mermaid gown? Oh no! That's the other dress I'm making for the grand opening of... - You get it. - Yeah. You know, Rae, I'm looking over the schedule here, and, well, it says you should've been done with those dresses, like, 45 minutes ago. Does that schedule say anything about breaking my wrist? No. Yeah, right, 'cause the schedule has changed. I sent you a text message. No, you didn't. You sent me, like, a blurry picture of your elbow, and a whole bunch of gibberish! I only have one working hand. That's your texting hand. All right, fine. What's the new schedule? So, instead of putting the finishing touches on all of the dress forms at one, packing them up and transporting them by three, and then putting them on the mannequins at four, I'm just gonna sew until, like, noon tomorrow. Okay. We open at ten. I know, Chels! Come on! It hurts! Ow ooo. Hey, you know who has two hands, a free schedule, and took Ms. Steinberg's third grade sewing class? Who's also gesturing to herself? Desperate times call for desperate measures. Yes! Ha! Let's do this! Yeah, let's do it. Okay... Just stop... It's like a ride! I mean, I have some nice kicks, but these are like next level. Tess, do you feel like we're kind of taking advantage of Nia's influencer fame? We could give the shoes back. No, I said... I said kind of, Tess. Wow, Nia's got that fame flame. Have you ever seen her look so happy? Well, the one time, I threw a soda can in the trash, then took it out and put it in the recycling bin, yeah, she happy-cried for hours. Wow. I have never dealt with this level of popularity before. I mean, you get used to it. My new followers take me so seriously. I posted this cute cat video and everyone thought I was starting an animal rescue campaign. I mean, I just thought it was cute, but then I started an animal rescue campaign! And I bet the rescue campaign was super cute too. With Psy-Key's help, I really am making a difference. Yeah, you are! These shoes are so comfortable, I feel like they actually make me more relaxed. A scuff?! This is why we can't have nice things, Jamar! Great work, people. Even you, Carl. Ah, now that's the sound of a good scoop. Are you working on your Peanut Profile of Nia? I'm actually looking into the company that's sponsoring her. Psy-Key! They have a wholesome reputation. Well, I did some digging, and I'm not sure they're as wholesome as they appear. Ooh. Tantalizing tale! Well, I need a couple more sources. I'm still fact-checking. Take all the time you need, but make it fast. If what you're saying is true, this could be pretty juicy! We can't sit on it for too long. I'm on it, Chief. All right, Chels, we're gonna start with something super simple. Oh, this is so exciting! I get a little glimpse into your, you know, creative process. - Exactly. All right, step one! - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Turn on the machine. - Okay. Ah! There, that wasn't so hard. Look at you! You're a natural. Yes, I have very accurate button-pressing skills. Now, I want you to do a blind hem stitch on this dress. Oh, all right, Rae, if you... if you think it'll help. Just follow my lead, okay, Chels? Okay. - Put your foot on the pedal. Yeah. - Okay. - All right... Oh, see? - Oh! - Yeah. - Careful! Got a lot of power! - I want you to go a little straight, - Okay. A little up... - ...and then a little back, all right? - Got it. - Okay, up... - No, just a little bit, a little straight. A little up, and then a little back. Okay, I'm gonna try again. Straight, up, back, and then you gotta follow... Don't go to the left 'cause you gotta make sure the fabric... Ow! - I got it, I got it, I got it. - Ow, Venus! Hey, Rae! Hey, um, I was thinking, why don't you and Venus, you know, go take a rest or something, huh? Chels, if I go back in that room, I'm going to sleep. Perfect, right? I mean, we're fine out here. This machine practically does everything itself. I'll finish up sewing and then go to the work space and set up, huh? - Really, Chels? - Yeah! Thank you so much. Thank you so much, thank you. Aah! Well, I don't hate it. Guess who got a new swag box! - We did! - We did! All right, Nia, come on. Tell me what's in the box. Come on, tell me what's in the box. Tell me, Nia! Okay, look, I'm not great at the whole patience thing. I'm gonna open this live on my MeGram page. Unboxing videos get tons of views. - But I'll let you know what we get! - Okay, okay, okay. She gon' go do that right now, Tess, right? She's gon' go unbox the box, and then tell us what's in the box, Tess? Please tell me, Tess! Okay, you're, like, up here, and you need to bring it down to here. You guys, where's Nia? I don't think Psy-Key delivered to countries in need. Uh, so? They fell behind a little. I mean, it must be hard keeping up with so many deliveries. Yeah. I mean, how many have they delivered so far? According to my source, nada, zero, zilch, one minus one! Those poor people in need. They could be looking so dope. Levi, I don't think you're right. I mean, the majority of Psy-Key's success is built on the fact that they give swag to countries in need. Well, I'm afraid my source says they haven't delivered anything. Everyone, post about your donations and tag Psy-Key! What'd you see? I saw Nia donating and talking about Psy-Key. They must be legit. That's why Nia looked so happy. Levi, I don't trust your source. Check out all of the swag! Oh, I never thought being an influencer would have such an impact! And not just online but at school too. - Oh, word? - Word. So many people have joined the composting club and are volunteering at the homeless shelter because of me. And somebody even made a Carver Peanut statue out of recycled plastic bottles. Oh, nothing says success like a trash statue. Being an influencer is so rewarding! Levi, I agree with Booker. I've never seen Nia so happy, and she's doing so much good! I don't think you should say anything until you are sure it's true. Okay, I'll keep researching, but you guys keep Nia from posting about Psy-Key. If I'm wrong, no harm done, but if I'm right, you'll have saved Nia's reputation. Ah, please let Levi be wrong. Oh, please let Levi be wrong. Okay, so we just need to distract Nia from posting while Levi does more research on Psy-Key. No problem. I mean, how hard can it be to keep a teenage girl off her phone? I'm sorry, what? Okay, I'm ready for my close-up! Actually, not too close up. I wanna get my shoes in it. Uh, Nia, wait. Um, your hairdo is looking a little hair-don't. Let me fix it. Okay, um, here you go. Oh! - Let me fix your makeup. - Okay... Tess, what are you doing? Oh, girl, you look a mess. Yeah, you don't want any of these. Oh! These are hilarious! Oh, they're so candid. I'm totally relatable. Yeah, well, you know what? Let me post them for you. Okay. Oh, man. The MeGram app just disappeared. Oh. No, no, you just accidentally deleted it. No worries. I'll re-download. But I think I'm gonna keep my hair like this, Tess. It's very edgy. Oh, it's ready. Right... ...and post! Thank you, guys! Man, looks like it is impossible to keep a teenage girl off her phone. Did you say something? Oh, wow. Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Chels! Chelsea, I need to talk to you! Chels! Boo! You should be happy I only have one good hand. Come on! I was just having a laugh, but I scared you though, didn't I? - Didn't I? - Not as much as these outfits! Chels, these are not my designs! Is that... your... shirt? Yeah! Yeah, I put a little bit of myself into every design. Which reminds me, I think we need to refill the first aid kit. Thanks, Chels. I appreciate you for helping out, I really do. - Thank you. - Come here. We're just gonna have to postpone the opening. What? No, no, we can't postpone, Rae. Everybody's RSVPed! Oh, then we're gon' have to lock the door and put a sign up that says this building is condemned, 'cause I... Hi! Hello! Hello! Chels! Chelsea, we gotta get... Alexandra, I need to talk to you about the Psy-Key story! Gonna be huge. You were really onto something. Well, I'm gonna need some more time. I just need to fact-check a few more sources. Go ahead, Levi. Take all the time you need. Thank you. - Because I already wrote it. - Wait, what? I looked into Psy-Key, and you were right. I knew it would be a conflict of interest for you because you're a really good brother, so I did the heavy lifting. We're sharing a byline, Levi. You're welcome! We have to stop the article. It can't go to print or post! Levi! It's done! The Peanuts have a right to know the truth! I love all the MeGram comment love I've been getting. Hey, check this one out. "Thought you cared about the world, Nia. Guess not." That wasn't love. - That's harsh. - Hey, you know what? Trollers gon' troll. - Yes, they are. - True. All right. I'm sure the other comments are nice. Let's see. "You are a fraud." Hey, guys, what's up? - Hey wait. You don't think they know? - No. How could they? All right, next one! Let's see... Oh! Great, here's a good one. Let's see, it's a link to the Peanut Post. Levi must've finished his article about me. "Psy-Key, More Like Lie-Key." Wait, this says Psy-Key hasn't donated any items to charity! Ever. Oh my gosh, guys, this is horrible! - Yeah, horrible. Awful. - Terrible. That's ridiculous. Why would Levi write this without telling me? I should've been the first person that he talked to! Nia, I need to talk to you! Oh, now you wanna talk to me? Yes. There's gonna be an article... - Levi, it's too late. - She found out. Wait. You all knew? How could you keep this from me? Well, I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't until I had all the facts. Yeah, and me and Tess tried to protect you and keep you from posting, but... But the more we messed with you, the better you looked. - Yeah. - It's actually very annoying. Everyone is calling me a fraud. And they're right. I thought Psy-Key was great, but they're not, and I put my name behind them. But you used your new audience to speak up about things that matter. You couldn't know what you didn't know. I mean, she could've known if we would've told her. - Yeah. - We didn't say nothing. Yeah, that's on us. We definitely could've... Exactly. Like, "Hey! Hello!" "An article's gonna come out." Like, yeah, yeah. True. But it's also on me. No, I should've looked deeper into Psy-Key before accepting that sponsorship. Nia, listen to me. You cannot let those comments get to you. Your intentions were good. Those people don't know you like we do. Well, they will. I need to make this right. Yeah, but we get to keep the stuff, right? I mean, it's already been worn. So, who's with me? - Too soon. - Come on, man. - We sold everything, Chels. Everything! - I know! Even your stuff. We sold scrap fabric as headbands! You're welcome! And my life coaching is so on point. I even convinced this woman who's afraid of the dark to get into the closet, turn the lights off, and shut the door! - No way! No way! You did that, girl? - Yes way! Way! I did that! - How long was she in the closet for? - Oh, no. Hey... Claire! Claire! Good work! Good work, huh? Listen, um, this one's on the house. Oh. Okay, we sold a whole bunch of janky clothes, you locked a woman in the closet for I don't know how long... - Yeah, that happened. That happened. - We can do no wrong! Yeah, I guess two wrongs do make a right. Or our business. Just like our friendship. Wabi-sabi. Yeah, Rae. That's what we are. We're wabi-sabi. What does wabi-sabi mean? It's Japanese. It means that there's beauty in the flaws. Aw. We were so worried about making this opening and everything perfect, when, in actuality, the mistakes is what made it perfection. Oh, Rae. I love that. - Wasabi, Rae. Wasabi. - Wabi-sabi. - Wabi-sabi. - Wabi-sabi. So, I'm officially not wearing or promoting Psy-Key in any way. Psy-Key weaves a web of lies, and everyone hates spiders. Dang. She's really giving it to 'em. I don't know what she means, but preach, girl! Okay, guys. I'm reading your live comments. "You're only apologizing 'cause you got caught." No. I'm apologizing because I found out that Psy-Key is dishonest, which I didn't know. "That's not enough, fraud." - You're right. - You know what? Nia believed Psy-Key was doing good. So, we're going to do what they didn't. We're gonna donate all the swag Psy-Key gave us to charity. We are? I-I mean, that's what's up. I'll miss you. - Book, I love that idea. - Okay. Um, so post photos of what you're donating to charity, whether it's Psy-Key's swag or just something you don't need anymore. And Psy-Key, it's not too late to fulfill your promise to donate to charity. Everyone, post about your donations and tag Psy-Key! Read this one. "Wow, you're inspiring." That's really sweet, but we're just kids trying to do good. Bye, guys! Thank you guys for defending me and for coming up with that idea. Well, I had a vision of you donating, so I was like, we should donate. Wow, your vision came in handy! That's happened, never. Nia, we've got a new angle for your Peanut Profile. Levi, I think I'm gonna stay out of the press for a while. You've inspired so many people. We're doing a story focused on how you've encouraged people to take action and give back. You're welcome! Oh. Thank you, guys. This feels good. My shoe game has taken a step back, though. But I feel good. Well, Mom, I heard your grand opening was a great success. Oh! Who told you that? You-you did. That's right because sometimes you gotta brag when you do something special. Oh! Well, then Nia should start bragging, huh? With that new sponsorship from a conscious company? Thanks, Aunt Chels. - Yeah. - And Mother Earthwhile checks out. They use recycled materials to make products that help you reduce waste. So, you don't have to worry about that one. Isn't it awesome? I mean, they're not kicks. They're better! - Thank you. - What?! Oh, great! Metal straws? Ah. Saving the world one sip at a time.
