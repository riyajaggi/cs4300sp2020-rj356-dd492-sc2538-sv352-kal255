 Raven's Home was filmed in front of a live studio audience. Okay, we haven't had Chelsea's cooking in months, so we're gonna drink this milk to coat our stomachs. - Everybody ready? - Yeah. Okay, bottoms up! Okay, I thought we'd start with an amuse-bouche. These are medjool dates stuffed with goat cheese. Aunt Chelsea, I'll pass. I don't eat anything I can't pronounce. I don't eat dates, I just go on 'em.

 Staring at Rihanna posters isn't a date. Listen, you guys, I know I was a horrible cook before, but on the cruise ship I studied with, like, all the famous French chefs, including... Chef Pierre. Anyway, um... Bon appetite! - Come on, guys. Let's give it a try. - Yeah. - This is delicious! - Yeah? Who are you? And what have you done with my mother? - Hey, Aunt Chelsea, this is bomb. - Yeah? Aunt Chelsea, as the French say,

 this is yum-yum-yum! Thank you! Really, Chels? It took you six months to learn how to stick some goat cheese inside of date and call it a amu-am-am, call it a ama-ama...

That better be good enough to win that 25,000 dolla-dolla bills, y'all! Ignore the camera. I'm getting BTS. That's "behind the scenes" in director talk. Behind the scenes of what? I mean, we don't even have a name yet. Uh, we do have a name. "Booker and the Bookettes." That's funny. Oh, you're serious? - No. - No. And they're not even called "groups" anymore, you know? They're more like "collectives." - Like a collection of talents. - Oh, that's what's up, Nia! - Yeah, we take... we take "Chicago"... - Mm-hmm. And "collective," we put it together... - Yeah? - And we're the "Chi-lective." - Oh! - Yeah, I bring the beats. - Okay. - Nia brings the vocals. And, Booker, you bring the swag. And, Levi... what do you do again? I'm gonna direct the video. For free. Okay, let's get started. How long do we have your place for? Yeah, don't worry about it, small fry. My mom's working a double, and my dad's got a night drive to Georgia. Wait, you mean, you have the whole place to yourself, without any parents? Yeah, but let's keep that between us. Okay? 'Cause my parents don't want anyone up in our business. Hey, I love it. No parents, and we can hang here and finish this. Yeah, I mean, Mom is definitely not gonna love it. - Yeah, well, Mom's not gonna know. - Agreed? - Okay... - Okay? Good. But first, some ground rules. Don't... spill... or touch... anything. Can... we... breathe? Oh, Rae, we haven't laid out like this in forever! - Just us girls! - Yeah! So, what's the haps, huh? What's the tea? Spill it. Okay, well... oh! My dad came to visit. I'm sorry, I just got the funniest text from Nikos from Mykonos. Anyway, what else happened? Oh, well, um... One Halloween, Booker and I, we switched bodies for a minute. What? That's crazy! - I know! - No, Nikos just sent me a text of the sunset we shared on the Canary Islands. Guess what. No canaries. Like I was saying, um... Let's see... I switched bodies. I had a huge fashion - show, too. - Oh! Nikos is a fashion model! Yeah. Or he plays one and his evil twin on a Greek soap opera. - You know what's funny about that, Chels? - What? I didn't ask. Wow, Rae, you seem really stressed. On the boat we would use mindful meditation to relax. - You know what we do in Chicago to relax? - Hmm? We dream about being on a cruise, but we can't because we're raising a bunch of kids. ♪ Uh, yeah ♪ ♪ Okay, okay ♪ ♪ Yeah, uh ♪ ♪ You know what it is, uh ♪ ♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh ♪ ♪ Uh, yeah ♪ ♪ Boom ♪ That's all I got. I'm gonna need you to get a little more. Guys, I just had a vision. Nia, you were dancing around in smoke. Smoke? Well, that's bad. No. No, no, no, but you seemed happy. - What do you think it means? - Booker, that wasn't a vision. That was inspiration. Yeah, that's what we'll call our song. Like a smoky flow. ♪ Yeah, I got that smoky flow ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm 'bout to let 'em know ♪ Okay, okay. All right, ready? All right. ♪ Yeah ♪ - You... you take it. - Okay, yeah. ♪ We... We got that smoky flow ♪ - Hey! - Okay, okay. Um, thought about takin' this one. Is that okay? ♪ Yeah, we 'bout to let 'em show ♪ - Okay! - Oh. - All right. Can I? Can I? - Go on. - Your turn. - All right. Words, words. ♪ We got that smoky flow ♪ - Yes! - Nice. ♪ And we're about to let it show ♪ Guys, I seriously thought we were gonna have to borrow something from Drake. Yeah, I thought I wasn't gonna get a word in, but I did. Hey guys, I found a smoke machine. Hey, a smoke machine. Uh, maybe that's what I saw. - Let's use it in the video. - Yes! Booker, Levi, dinner's ready. - Come on, we gotta go. - What? We just got our flow on. Hey, if we don't go over there, Mom's coming over here. Hey! Did you get my text? It's time for dinner. What are we gonna do? What if she finds out we're here alone? - I got this, I got this. - Great. - I'll just be my mom. - Okay, okay... Cool your jets, all right? What y'all doin' in there? We're just saying bye to Mrs. O'Malley. Bye, Mrs. O'Malley! Kids, get outta here! I gotta make a pizza for my daughter! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Hey, Rae! - Hey! Hey, I noticed you cleaned out the closet. Did you move my wedding dress? I can't find it. Oh, uh, which, um... which... which... Which wedding, uh... which wedding dress are you, uh, speaking of? The only wedding dress I have. I wear it every Valentine's Day. Right, right. Hey, Chels, remember that jacket that I made for the British girl group Little Mix? Oh yeah, yeah! Those jackets with the Alencon lace. What? Wait, no! I repurposed it. You're welcome. How could you do that?! Easy, with some scissors. No... You know that's not what I meant! I'm sorry, Chels, while you were sunbathing on a cruise, I was here with the kids, trying to raise them and stay afloat. Listen, I know my seminars were kind of unsuccessful, but I did send back some money. Yeah, and I used that to buy the scissors. You know what? Whatever, Rae! Hey, where's my panini press? I can't find that either. Where's my 13-course meal, huh? French cooking is a mood, okay? And right now, I am not in it! Seriously, where's my panini press, huh? Huh? What did you do? Did you cut that up and make a helmet for Lady Gaga? - You know what? - What? Great idea, Chels! I wish I did! Listen, what is going on, okay? I thought we had all that bonding time on the Jet Ski. - I thought we were cool. - I thought we were going to die. Listen, all I know is I was excited to come back, you know? Levi and my bestie? But what did I come back to? A cut-up wedding dress, you know, a missing panini press, and just a whole lot of stress, okay?! You know what? Why don't you answer it, Chels? Go ahead and answer it. I'm know Nikos is probably texting you. Oh, Nikos... 'Cause even when you're here, you're not here, Chels. Mom, that's not Aunt Chelsea's phone, that's mine. Tess just wants to know when we're headed back over. I think now would be a good time. - If you'll just excuse me. - Wait a second. Hold up. Wait, wait, hold on. Hold it! Hold it! Now, Tess's mom seemed really annoyed. Are you sure it's okay that you guys are shooting that music video over there? - Yeah, she just keeps to herself. - Mm-hmm. If anything, it's almost like she's not even there. Hey Levi, what are you working on? I'm sketching out my ideas. That's what us true artists do. Yeah, a true artist doesn't draw stick figures. Actually, Picasso used stick figures in Don Quixote. - All right guys, focus. The lyrics are good. But are the semi-finals good? Smoky flow, big picture. What is the story we're telling? The who, the what, the why. Um, maybe it's about the creative flow that we've got between us. You know, when I think of smoky flow, I think of smoke. And, and... I think of flow. And how we spit that hot fire. That's it! - How we spit those flames! - Yes! Yo, Levi, give me a beat. ♪ I'm the GOAT ♪ ♪ Call me LeBron James ♪ - Of course. - Will do. - ♪ My flow so hot ♪ - Yo, ay! - ♪ I'm spittin' flames ♪ - Ay! - Ay! - Ay! All right, hold on.

Uh, listen, Rae. I was... Okay, so that's how it's gonna be. All right, well, you're gonna have to finish that magazine eventually, and then you'll have to talk. Rehearsal's up!

This video's gonna be on fire! Yeah! That's not the only thing that's gonna be on fire. It's okay, my mom stocks the fridge when she's away. Uh-oh. Oh, your mom's not here? Ooh, y'all gonna get it! You guys were in here alone? You could've burned the whole building down! I wanted to tell you that Tess's parents are working all the time... but they told me if I did... I couldn't direct the video! What? We did not say that. And now you're lying about lying on top of lying. Sometimes my priorities get mixed up! Hey, Levi, cool it with the fake tears, bruh. Yeah, your Auntie Rae's right. - We're not buying it. - Why did you kids lie? Mom... We didn't lie. No. I mean, Tess impersonated her mom, and she lied for us. Nia, did you just throw me under the bus? Hey, sometimes a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do, Tess. I need everyone to go home. I need to talk to Tess. That's right. Come on. Move it, move it. Move it, move it. But we have to figure out our outfits for the video. You're talking like somebody who's not in trouble. Get out, get out, get out! Tess, where do you think you're going? - With them. - No, sit down. What is going on with your parents, Tess? And why didn't you tell me you were here alone? I don't know. I was embarrassed. My mom had to work extra shifts at the hospital to help with the bills, because my dad isn't making the money he used to. Tess, that's nothing to be embarrassed about, sweetheart. There's a lot of people struggling. But what I don't understand is why you didn't tell me you were here alone. You could've stayed with us. We're struggling a little bit. My parents, they don't want anybody to know. We're not anybody, Tess. We're your family, and we love you. So you're gonna stay with us until your mom and dad get back, cool? - Cool. - Okay. But I'm not gonna get it like Booker and Nia, right? Oh, no, you gon' get it! I don't get disciplined too much. - Thanks, Ms. B. - You're welcome. Chelsea, listen, I am tired of the silent treatment, okay? I'm sorry I ripped up your wedding dress. Oh yeah? Well, I'm sorry you only have one wig. No, I don't. I got like... - Oh, really? - Yeah. That's okay, that's okay. Just from this point on, we have to promise to be open and honest and stop keeping things from each other. Okay. It just got to be too much, Rae, you know? I lost everything. My money, my house, my marriage. I could've come back sooner, but I... I stayed on the ship so long because I... I needed to get away, you know? Thank you so much for taking such good care of Levi. Yeah, listen, um... Now's a really good time to tell you that while you were gone, I, um... I left Levi at the mall for two hours. I wasn't trying to get away. I just... I just drove away. Well, the important thing is, you know, you went back to get him. The cop had to drop him off at home. Rae... While we're being honest, right? And, you know, the rest of the time, I took real good care of him. Yeah. Well, it looks like a lot's changed in the last six months. - Yeah. - But you know what hasn't changed? You're still my bestie, Rae. Always. - Always. - Always. And I would do it all again. I love you. I love you. Okay, so show me Nikos. Okay, all right. Let me get a picture. Hold on one second. - Yaas. - Yaas!
