 - Refresh, please. - It's not refreshing. Ow! - Pin. - Pin. - If it was refreshing... - Just try it again. Ow! Mom! You know, suck it up. Fashion hurts. Yeah.

 How much success do you need? Easy with the poking. The poking is not on me. The poking is on y'all. You need to stay still and put your phones down. Sorry, mom. But we're trying to get this raffle going for school. We're in charge of this fundraiser. But so far, we're not raising any funds. No one's buying tickets. I'll buy one if you'll stand still so your mama can work her magic. I'd wait 'til you see the prizes. Hey, Nia. People donated more prizes to the raffle. Great. Let's hope this box has better stuff. It doesn't. What is that? Principal Kwan's homemade peanut hand.

 - Weird. - Better weird than gross. I give you the Guntz's used trumpet. It's not that gross. Oh! Still filled with Guntz spittle. I'd donate that dollar just to make it stop. - Make it stop. Make it stop. - Yes, yes. Why do we even bother? We're never gonna sell raffle tickets with these prizes. Is there anyway we can just cancel this thing? Ow! All right, you did that one on purpose. You can't prove that. But you two made a commitment to both me and the school, and you're going to stick to both. Ooh, time for us all to head down to Fashion Now! offices and meet with our celebrity emcee. Ooh. Celebrity. Who is it? What? Can I tell them? Can I tell them? - No. I wanna. - I wanna. - I wanna. - I wanna. I booked him. Yeah, but I hired you to book him. Can we do it together? - Yeah, sure, sure. - Okay. We can do it together. On three. Ready? Three. Lil Z! - Lil Z? - Lil Z? - Lil Z? - Lil Z? Like, the MeTube star? We watch "Keeping it Real with Lil Z" all the time! He's always calling people out when they're not being real. We've even got his "Dang" app. "Dang" app? Daaang! Daaang! They got an app for everything. Mom, this is huge. He's like the ultimate social influencer for kids. He's got like, what, nine million followers? That's why I booked him. Just looking for a little pat on the back. Good job, Sebby. Ow. Ooh! My bad.

Coming at you from the Fashion Now! Headquarters. Gettin' a little bit of swag for my swagger, you know. There he is! It's really Lil Z. I can't believe it. We're gonna meet Lil Z! Not if you keep acting like that. He can see you. Oh. Now remember, this is big for Ravenous. And Lil Z likes to keep it real. So whatever you were just doing, just... don't do that. That's right, we're cookin' up something that's gonna be served up hot Saturday night. To find out what it is, check out my channel to see me keepin' it real. - Perfect. - Thank you. Raven, good to see you again. Good to see you too. Kids, this is LaTonya, the event coordinator. LaTonya, the crew: Booker, Nia, Levi, and my assistant, Sebastian. Nice to meet you all. And I'm sure you know who this is. What up? I'm Lil Z and this is my assistant, Loretta. She handles all my scheduling, my meals, wakes me up in the morning... That's 'cause I'm his mother. Come here, you got a little something. Wait, mom! Just keepin' it real clean. Thank you so much for emceeing my show. No problem. When I checked out Ravenous, I was like, "Daaang, that's hot." Daaang, that's hot. Daaaang, you sound just like me. Daaang, I do. All right, we've got some details to iron out for the fashion show. Why don't you kids get to know each other. So... 'Sup? - 'Sup. - 'Sup. - 'Sup. - 'Sup. I should probably be in that meeting. How come moms are always licking their fingers and wiping our faces? It's embarrassing. Or, how about when they drop you off at a party and then yell out the window, "Make good choices!" Right. Or when you forget your lunch and then they show up at school in a robe and house shoes. Mine too. Are my fuzzy wuzzy's bothering you? I heard that. Y'all are pretty real. I like you guys. And our mom said you wouldn't like us if we did this. She was right. I'm just playing, man. That was pretty funny. Let's take a selfie. Mind if I tag you? It's not keepin' it real to tag without asking first. - Yeah. - Please. Tag away. Wow. I can't believe you guys actually met Lil Z. Nah, nah. We didn't just meet Lil Z, we're gonna hang out with him. 'Cause we tight like that. Ooh. I wanna be tight like that with Lil Z. Okay, all right. Nobody's gonna be tight like that with Lil Z. We need to figure out how to raise money, so we can get better dryers for our school bathrooms. Oh, yes! I am tired of doing this. You know what I would buy ticket for? To be tight like that with Lil Z. Yeah! Great idea. Lots of celebrities donate their time for charity. Yeah, I'd love to grab a seltzer with the guy and talk shop. What kind of shop are you gonna talk? I got plenty of shop to talk. Guys, I want dry hands and a face just as much as anybody. But I don't think Lil Z is gonna wanna do that. Really? Or are you not actually tight like that with him? Yeah. Maybe that picture was fake. Why would Lil Z fake a picture with us? If anything, we'd fake a picture with him. You said it, not me. The picture is real. We just can't make having a seltzer with Lil Z a raffle prize, okay? Now, let's think. Smoothies on the roof? That's what's up. But we can make having smoothies with Lil Z on the roof a raffle prize. - Ooh! - Ooh! - Ooh! - Ooh! Booker. What are you doing? You know, we haven't even asked Lil Z. He doesn't even like to be tagged without asking. Look, I just had a vision. This could be our chance to save the raffle. Now, who wants to buy raffle tickets to hang out with Lil Z? - Me! - Me! - Me! - Me! - Me! - Me! And the winner of the smoothie with Lil Z is... Sienna. - Awww. - Awww - Awww - Awww. - Awww - Awww Yes! I'll be tight like that! Oh, yes! Hey, hey, hey. Hey, I like your R. Hey, man, your "Z" is pretty cool too. - You wanna trade? - You wanna trade? Yeah. - You gotta, uh... - Yeah, I got it. Here you go, kids. Ooh, are those homemade? Yes! Yes, there are. I opened the box at home and made them appear on this platter. Mm! These are bomb Miss Ravey Rae. Thank you very... Ravey Rae? I got a nickname from Lil Z. You know what? I'm gonna call that my beachwear line. But then wouldn't that be Wavy Rae, Miss B? Eat a cookie, Tess. Booker. When are you gonna ask him about the raffle? Let the man finish his hat selfie first. Okay. I gotta hit the studio. But it's been cool hanging out with y'all today. I haven't even posted since I've been here, and that's big for me. Uh... Yeah, we should do it again sometime. How about tomorrow? Sounds great. Booker! He's leaving. Ask him now. And... And speaking of tomorrow... You know? Usually when I hang out with folks, sooner or later, they hit me up for a favor. But not y'all. Y'all are givers, not takers. - Yeah. - That's us. - Givers. - Deuces. This is not good. Yeah, he's got us all wrong. We're totally takers. But how are you gonna get him to give without him knowing you're taking? Sienna's expecting smoothies on the roof with him tomorrow. And that's what she's gonna get. We just have to make sure Lil Z doesn't know that he's a raffle prize. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll have Sienna up to the roof, and tell Lil Z we're keepin' it real on our community rooftop. Well, welcome to our community rooftop. Yup. The community loves it up here. And you can't keep the community away. Y'all sure say community a lot. But that's a real word. I like that. Community. And sometimes the community likes to kick back and enjoy it with smoothies. Smoothies on the roof? That's what's up. That was my vision. So, Sienna, even though you're the winner, there are a few ground rules that you have to follow. Lil Z likes to keep it real. So whatever you do, just don't bring up the raffle. In fact, just don't talk at all. Seriously? I can't talk? Well, you can say a few words, but no full sentences. He hates chit-chat. Good looking out. 'Cause I can get a little chit-chatty. Oh, look! Here comes Nia with a member of our community right now. O-M-G! - There he is! - Chatty. Um, Sienna, this is Lil Z. Lil Z, Sienna. Hey, what up, Sienna? Excited. Okay... So, you go to school with these guys? Excited. She sure is excited. She just wants to get right down to the smoothies. Hey, that's real. Hello, community! Oh, look! Here comes the community smoothie girl. - Why are the so small? - Oh, no. They're not small. They're lil'. You know Lil Z likes to keep things lil'. Cheers to community friends. Hey! All right. Uh, that was fun. Yeah? Let's wrap this up. - I'm not finished. - Uh-uh. Lil Z don't like lil' sippers. And we're done. Wait. Just one thing. It was fast and weird and I'll never forget it. Dang. That Sienna girl just tagged me without asking. Oh, it's probably nothing. Don't even... Don't... No. Best raffle prize ever? I'm a raffle prize? Is that what this was all about? Daaang. That's cold. Why would you all do that without asking? Well, we wanted to. But we didn't want you to think we were takers. So you lied? Well, would it help if we said it was for a good cause? What good cause? New hand dryers in the school bathrooms. Man, you all can't just keep it real and go like this? I thought y'all was different. Gusy, we really messed that one up. Well, at least he's still doing your mom's fashion show. Oh, and tell your mom and LaTonya I'm not doing the fashion show. Wow. That just got real, real fast. I got Lil Zs voicemail again. What are we gonna do? I don't know, but until we figure something out, Booker, you can't tell mom. Shh! Here they come. Here they come. Don't worry about me. You stay strong. You're the one that's always caving. I don't cave. You do tend to cave. Well, I'm not gonna cave. I got this. My time has come, everyone. I finally get a chance to walk before the fashion world and hear Brava, brava! Brava, brava! It should be a lot louder than that. But ah! You guys! Are you guys ready for the biggest night in all of our lives? We are, Mom. Everything's gonna be great. No it's not. We ruined everything. Caver! What are you talking about, Nia? Ruined everything? - I... - Nothing's ruined. Nothing. Well, I hope not. I mean, I don't even want to hear the word ruined on my big night. - Oh, hey Miss B. - Hey. I'm sorry everything's ruined. What? Oh! They didn't tell you yet. Is that my mom calling? I gotta go. That's the second "ruin" tonight. What's going on? Spill it. We raffled off Lil Z without his permission, and now he's mad and now he won't do your show. What? Excuse me. Excuse me. No, no, no. Shh. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - One more? - I think so. I just need... Mom, we're sorry we messed up. But LaTonya doesn't know Lil Z backed out. So we still have time to get him back before tonight. - Right. So we figure if we... - No, no, no. You all are done figuring, all right? I have worked too hard to give up now. I gonna go find Lil Z and my show is happening. - Preach! - No, you're staying here. The preach? Was it too much? No, I just need you to make sure the kids get down to the show, so they can be ready to model. - Preach! - It's too much. Okay. We need to do something to fix this. We made a commitment to make your mom's show a success, and we're gonna follow through. But she told us to stay out of it. Oh. And you're choosing now to listen to her? No. No, no, no. In case your mom doesn't come back with Lil Z, we're gonna be ready with a backup plan. Daaang. We messed up. Why y'all eyeing me like that? - Mm. - Mm, just one... Okay. - Mm-hmm. - Oh! Daaaang! Guys, guys. The coast is clear. Come on, this way. Do you really think this is gonna work? Are you doubting my extreme makeover skills? I'll have you know, I once won a Halloween costume contest as the Rock. Like The Rock or a rock? I've actually done both. Just remember the plan. In case your mom doesn't get the real Lil Z back the show must go on. Booker's going to keep it real and pretend to be Lil Z. Not to be Negative Ned, but if Booker's gonna be Lil Z, who's gonna model for Booker? That's right. This suddenly became a very bad plan. Lil Z! There you are. Daaaang, it's me. Did you get shorter? Our plan just got worse. Uh, well. You know... The other day I had on platform shoes, but that wasn't keepin' it real. All I know is it's getting real late. Has anyone seen Raven? She's just fashionably late. It's kind of her thing. Well, you kids need to get dressed, and you need to get out to the DJ booth. And you need to get to hair and makeup. Where's Booker? -Uh, he's closer than you think. Is this neck hole getting smaller? Hey, what's up? Welcome to your Scut ride. I'm your Scuter... Ravenaldo. Um, where to Lil Z? - How'd you know my name? - Everybody knows your name. I mean, um... Just keepin' it real. What kind of accent is that anyway? It's... international. So, um... um, er a-aren't you supposed to be keepin' it real at the Ravenous fashion show? Wait. Wait. How'd you know about that? Because it's my fashion show and you supposed to be keepin' it real there. Ravey Rae? How'd you know where I was? You live stream everything. It wasn't difficult. And what are you doing in a Scut ride by yourself, without your mama? You're only 13. I've got nine million followers. I don't need my mama. Oh, you need your mama. Did you call my mama? Oh, I called your mama. Daaang. That's cold. Well, listen, Mr. MeTube, you might tell nine million followers to keep it real, but you need your mama to tell you how to keep it real. - Preach, mama. - Oh, I'm preachin', girl. But if you wanna get in on this sermon, you go ahead. Oh, I'll sing in the choir on this one. Listen here, Lil Z, now I taught my kids to keep it straight with people and they weren't with you. That was wrong. And there's no excuse for that. But you made a commitment to this lady here. And it'd be wrong of you not to honor it. ♪ Wow! ♪ Dang! It's the attack of the mamas in here. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Guys, this isn't good. Mom isn't here with Lil Z yet I'm gonna have to go on as him. Okay, nobody panic. The show is about to begin! Okay, everybody panic. - What am I gonna do? - Don't panic? Are we panicking or not? - I am! - Me too. Booker, you can do this you have to do this. All right, now we're gonna get changed and we're gonna do this together. Yeah, but I'm the one out there alone, Nia. Man up, bruh. Come on, it's showtime! Where is your mother? This is Fashion Now! Not Fashion when you get here. Levi, Levi. No, no. Sebastian. Sebastian, Nia! Nobody panic. We're here. LaTonya: Hello, beautiful people. Oh, looks like we're just in time. There's two Lil Zs. Now can we panic? Yeah. Can't breathe. Ahh! Fashion Now! is always on the cutting edge and today is no exception. Here to emcee the Ravenous fashion show, is MeTube star, Lil Z! What up? Ha ha! - Booker? - Oh! Uh, Booker? I'm not Booker. I'm Lil Z. Dang, that's cold. Booker? Ha ha! What you doing, man? I'm making bad choices. - What up? - Wait a minute, What up? - Ha ha! What up? - What up? What's going on, Nia? Why am I seeing two Lil Zs on stage? It's all part of the show. Thank you. Here's what's up! Here's what's up. There are two Lil Zs, right? Yeah, but only one Lil Z can be real. And like Lil Z, Ravenous is real. You know, it's real fashion for real kids. So, security, help us keep it real and take away this faker. Hey! Take him out, you know. - Hey, wait! - No, no, no. Not him. Littler Z, right there. Daaang, Nia. That's cold! Thank you. And now... Ravenous! ♪ Gonna set it off ♪ ♪ Gonna set if off ♪ ♪ Gonna set it off ♪ ♪ Gonna, gonna, gonna set it off ♪ ♪ Gonna set it off ♪ This is the kind of vibe we love at Fashion Now! - You did it, Raven. - We did it. Thank you. What happened to your shirt? ♪ Set it off! ♪ There's only one thing I can say about this. Uh, mind if we do it? We'd understand if you wouldn't. Nah, your mom explained it. There's only one thing they can say about this. - Daaang. That's hot! - Daaang. That's hot! Couldn't have said it better myself. And now, for the lady behind it all. She's full of passion and fashion, I know her as Ravey Rae. But we know her as mom. So give it up for the talented Raven Baxter. Thank you so much, everyone, for coming and helping me launch my fashion line, Ravenous. Because when fashion is this tasty, people get ravenous. We are so proud of you for following your dreams, Mom. You're our inspiration. Aw, I love you guys. Well, kids, sometimes you have vision and... sometimes your dreams come true. So, um... Does this mean we're going to be rich now? - Yeah, does it? - O-O-O-O..... Yeah! Come on!
