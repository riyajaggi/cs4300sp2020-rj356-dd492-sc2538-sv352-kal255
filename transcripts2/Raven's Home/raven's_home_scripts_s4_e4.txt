 Any other questions? Me! I got a question. Where you do you guys expect to get all these fun funds from? - We're gonna get jobs. - We're gonna get jobs. This is the part where you tell us that you're proud of us? Oh, oh, oh! Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is just like the last time you wanted to play soccer, and you wanted a gerbil. I mean, the soccer ball is in the closet, and the gerbil, well, he's in a better place now. Mom, you're wrong. We can get jobs. Yeah, and we can keep jobs. And then we can have all of our fun.

What about mowing lawns? They're already mowed. - What about babysitting? - All the kids have been seated. Well, keep up the search, guys. I'm sure you'll find something. Yeah! They're doomed. Oh, mistaking an onion for deodorant. Been there. First of all, ew. Second of all, no. - My client Priya's coming today. - Oh, the superstitious one. Well, she's not necessarily superstitious. It's just when she speaks publicly, she wants everything to be exactly the same way all the time. Yeah, so superstitious. - Tomato, to‐mah‐to, onion, on‐ion. - What? The last time I saw her, - I had just come back from the gym. - Oh. Why not just go to the gym, Mom? Why don't you just mind your business, boo? Priya started from nothing, and she became a coffee shop queen. She is my most consistent and lucrative client. Priya, how did I know you were gonna be standing right there? You know me. That's why I love you. Now close the door so I can knock. You know that's how it has to happen every time. - Yes. That was perfect, and exactly what I needed, because everything else is going wrong today. What, what could be going wrong for someone so brilliant and talented as yourself? Oh, Raven, you're too kind. But the only reason I am talented and brilliant is because I follow my rituals to the letter. Yeah, Priya, hey. Hi. I wanted to talk to you about‐‐ Hey, Chels, why don't we let the talented and brilliant lady speak, and I will meet you at work. - Okay, but this is not over. - Okay. I agree. Yep. - I'm going to the office to do some life coaching, - to help people with bad habits. - You should. ‐And I feel so... ‐You should definitely do that. I agree. Please. Continue. My assistant quit. And I don't have time to follow my hiring procedure, and I have to speak at the opening of my 500th coffee shop, for Brew It, Can Do It tonight. I still don't have my lucky charm, my coffee, or my traditional pre‐ceremony salad, but how can I get them now? Nia, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yep. Picking up some stuff. How hard could it be? Hey. Hey, Priya, how are you? It's nice to see you. Booker. Nia. The last time I saw you, you were tiny little babies. Raven, get some babies. Yeah, well, we're big now, and we're super good at getting paid to, you know, pick up coffee, lucky charms. Salads. Well, that sounds like exactly what I need to restore the balance. You're hired. Raven, cancel the babies. Babies canceled, trust me. Listen, come over here. You cannot back out from this. She is a very important client, and I will not have you embarrass me. No, Mom, don't worry. We are in it to win it, right? Yeah. If my name isn't Booker "No Back‐ster" Carter. Get it? 'Cause I'm not backing out of this one, huh? I'm still workshop‐ing it. You ready? Let me give you my coffee order. Okay, just a real quick itty‐bitty thing. Um, how much did your last assistant make, per day? - Yeah. We have some fun to fund. - Two hundred dollars. Two hundred dollars? Nia, that's like, 50 for you, 150 for me. Okay, I brought my camera. What do you need? Congratulations, meatball. You have been selected to direct my video application. Wow. - Really? - Mm‐hmm. How many other applicants were there? Doesn't matter. You beat them all. Now let's get started. Great. What are we doing? I'm applying to Campus Champion. It's the top D‐1 feeder program in the nation. It could change my life. I have been working forever for a chance like this. - Great. When's it due? - Today. I'm sorry, did you just say "today"? That's a lot of pressure, Tess. I do my best work under pressure, half‐court. Now, let's get started. You just roll the camera, and I'll do what I do best. 'Kay. Ready, and action. Huh. Uh, must just be nerves. Let me try again. I'm gonna stand over there. I'll use the zoom. You know, I'm just gonna stand behind the door. Uh‐oh. I wasn't sure about this place, but I have to say, the energy is perfect. Okay, so let's recreate the day. - Ahem. - First, I showed you a lot of options. - In rainbow order. - Roy G. Biv. Oh. Hey, Priya, I, I wanted to ask you, this need you have to repeat everything exactly the way it was, what's that about? The first time Raven dressed me for a public speaking event, I landed a multimillion‐dollar investor. So now every time I have to speak in public, I recreate this day. It's really been working for me. But has it been working for the people around you? I can answer that. It's not. But I think we could work on that today, if you just step into my office‐‐ - Here you go. The coffee that you ordered, made fresh. Priya, I think this is something that could definitely work for you‐‐ Raven, I am so sorry, but there is cream in this coffee. It's okay. I can, I can make it work. I can make it work. See, um, a little is, is an accident, but a lot... ...is a design. Imma call it... "Aroma Wear‐apy." I'm workshop‐ing the title. I'm so sorry. I thought you said that you wanted cream. No, I said I wanted room for cream. Yes, yes, yes. And then we put the cream in the room that was left. Okay. But there's a difference. - These kids are always quitting. - ...quitting... Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, yes, yes. Room for cream, but with no cream, coming right up. Nia, I just had a vision of Mom telling Aunt Chelsea that she knew we were gonna quit. Oh, no. That is not gonna happen. Mom would never let us live it down. - Hey, if this is too much for the two of you... - No! No, no, no. No. This is not soccer, and this is not a gerbil. - This is our jobs. - Right. Which we love, so, so, so much. We will be right back with room for cream. All right? Okay. Now that I've got my rhythm, let's do this, Half Time. Sure thing. Take 47. And... action. Yeah, I'm gonna do you a favor and call "cut." Huh. Maybe if I get a head start? I'll just start shooting, and then you can record. Gotcha. This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. And I share a room with Booker. Could I make a suggestion? Please! Campus Champion already knows you can play basketball. So... what if we try something different? Different how? What if you make your video about all the non‐basketball moments that have made you into the player you are today? Fine. We can start here. When you look at this rooftop, you might see some garden boxes, and... a decent view. But I see a court. I came up here to practice before I ever joined a real team. Oh, sorry. I forgot to hit "record." And... action! Priya, I know you love wearing wedges for your event, - so I brought you a few options. - Mm. One. Wow. Girl! Va‐va‐voom! Which one would you say I normally wear? Girl! All right, listen, Priya. Um... Public speaking is about having confidence, right? And nothing says confidence like... Va‐va‐voom! I'd rather not toy with fate today. Plenty of room for cream, or no cream, or whatever you want. Mm. Perfect. You can really taste the room. Now you can go collect my lucky grass clippings. Your, your, your... Your lucky what now? Grass clippings. You're talking about grass clippings. Yes, she is. Grass clippings. The clippings of grass. I mean, if you guys have reached your limit... - No. No, no, no. - Then you need to go do something else. We're just, um, we're trying to understand, right? Still waiting. On the day I landed my multimillion‐dollar investor, I strolled through Millennium Park, and smelled the freshly cut grass. And now she carries around clippings with her to all of her major events. Yeah, that's totally normal. - We‐‐ That's totally normal. - Yeah. That's normal, and we can go take care of that for you. Okay. All right. One jar of special lawn clippings, at your service. I shouldn't smell them until right before the event, or all the luck will wear off. Although... Wait a minute. You collected this grass from the west side of the park. I need grass from the east side. But, but, but in the end, isn't it all just lawn clippings? The sun rises in the east. If I want my company to rise, I need rising grass clippings. The wrong grass clippings could sunset my career. Rising grass clippings. Okay, we're on it. All right. Oh, and pick up my lucky lentil and beet salad from Beets by J on your way back. I was eating it the day I landed my million‐dollar investor, and now it fuels me to run my business. You got a million dollars, and you spent it on beets? He means... He means that we will be right back, all right? It's unfortunate that Beets by J closed down, but luckily I found this recipe online. Now, can you taste this for me? ‐Thanks. Thank you. ‐Okay, okay. I'm eating it now. Ew! Okay, if their most popular salad features beets, it's no wonder J went out of business. I bet if we recreate this recipe, Priya will never know the difference. Now, can you think positive thoughts into these lentils for me? Oh, Nia, I don't have positive thoughts about lentils. They taste like dirt. Agreed, but it was kind of a crunchy granola restaurant, so, it's on the recipe. Nia, the recipe also calls for a ritual dance. And we're not doing that. I mean, I'm down if you're down. Do we just, like... like that? Start off slow. ♪ Oh! Oh! ♪ ♪ Oh! What's happenin'? ♪ ♪ What's happenin'? Oh! ♪ This is gonna be the best salad she ever had, Nia! This... is... ...the best salad ever! Woo! Yes! I can feel the positivity in the lentils. No one speaks positivity into lentils like J. No one. Mm. I can feel the luck filling me up right now. Or it could just be the lentils, and your vivid imagination. Chels, let Priya have her process, and let me get my profits, okay? Your dress is ready. Mm. Why don't you two take it with you? I'll need the dress and my grass clippings in the changing room before my event. Oh, and you know, I just remembered. I had another salad after I landed my investor. As a celebration. So, you're saying that you want another salad? You, you know that one had beets in it, right? Yep. The exact same salad. Tell J it's for P. ‐Okay, so the thing about J‐‐ ‐The thing about J is that, he can't wait to make another salad for you, right? We'll be back. And now, I'm about to show you the most important room of all. The kitchen. I know this fridge like the back of my hand. And I know these cabinets... like the back of my foot. Yeah, you do eat a lot of meals over here. It's not just about the food, Baby Bok Choy! You Baxter‐Carter‐Graysons have fed me in so many different ways. Like, how Ms. B keeps pictures of me on the fridge. Uh, look, Nia and Booker aren't even in this one. Or how your mom makes my favorite foods when we lose a big game. She always has the ingredients on hand, 'cause she shops with me in mind. You guys are always looking out for me. You've... nourished me here. And cut. Good use of the word "nourish." Campus Champion's gonna love an SAT word. Wait. Tess? Tess? Okay, we got lucky the first time. I mean, we had fresh beets and fresh lentils. Now we got canned lentils and jarred beets. Nia, she's gonna be able to tell the difference. No, Booker, think about it. Priya's not gonna eat this salad until after her speech. After she's paid us. It won't matter. Wow, Nia. What a Booker thing to say. I think we just come clean and tell Mom we're not gonna be able to do this. No! You know what happens if we give up? Your vision comes true, and I am not letting that happen. Come on, don't you believe that we can do this? Nia, this is too hard. We're never gonna be able to pull this off. Well, no. Not with you thinking negative thoughts at those lentils. You, you... Fine. Hey, lentils. 'Sup? Hey, uh, you're good, lentils. - You're doing a great job, lentils. - Yeah. You are. I believe in you. - Yes, lentils, you can do this. - Yeah. And you know what? So can we. - You're right, Nia. - Yeah. - Yeah, we can do this. - We can. This is easy. Yeah, this is easy. We can do this! - We are not giving up. - No! And you hear that, beets? We are not giving up... - No, no, no, no, no. We cannot let beet juice get on that dress! Oh, get the bag off! Get the bag off! Okay, okay, okay. Okay, come on. Get, get it out! Oh, thank goodness. Oh. Gosh. Okay. That was too close, Booker. Okay, we have to get these two things as far away from each other as possible. Good idea‐‐ No, no, no, no, no, no! Why? Why would you walk into the living room with beets? I don't know. Why are you walking to the kitchen with a dress? You know what? We, we can fix this. We can fix this, right? We got this, right? Booker, I don't have another pep talk in me. Aw, man! You want to talk about it? I love basketball, Levi. I love making threes. I love breaking ankles. I love saving the day with buzzer‐beaters... None of those words mean anything to me. But I'm listening. Playing a great game can make you feel alive. But I don't know if I'm ready for basketball to be my life. That explains why you were so camera shy. Are you sure you want to go to Campus Champion? No. You having me relive all the non‐basketball moments in my life... It made realize that my life is here. Even though it's a G‐1 meter program? You mean D‐1 feeder program? Look, if you understood what I meant, what's it matter? See? That's what I'd miss out on if I went to Campus Champion. Hey, there's no crying in basketball. Or is it football? - I can't remember. Soccer, maybe? - Mm‐mm. Hey, Nia, Nia, I think it's working, you know? It's less purple. More light purple. No, no, Booker, that's a cream dress. It needs zero purple! Okay, well, then it's not working at all! - I think we should just give up. - No. No, no. We're not gonna quit, all right? We're just regrouping. Hey. Hey, you, you remember when Priya got coffee on Mom's clothes? Oh, yeah. Hand me those beets. Go. Yeah, a little spill is an accident, right? But a bigger spill is a design. - Okay. - Okay. And here goes nothing. - Oh! - Okay. Now, now where's the design part? Listen, Priya. Sometimes in life, we want things to happen a certain way. But when they don't, we adjust. You know, like, did, did I see my ex‐husband running away with all my fortune? No. You know, but did my mother and Raven? Yes. The point is‐‐ My stuff is here. - Surprise! - Surprise! I... I... They're speechless, Nia. Is that a good sign? No, no, no, no, no. This is wrong! - It's a bad sign. - Okay, we're sorry. All right? We had everything that you needed, but then we had a little bit of a collision, which turned into confusion, which, uh, turned into inspiration. Voila! This is a catastrophe! I'm ruined! Priya please. Just calm down, okay? My kids worked really, really hard, and they deserve to be recognized for that. They did everything that you asked. They, they got your coffee with room in it. They got your grass clippings from the east side. They even got your salad from J‐‐ ‐Well, actually‐‐ ‐I'm on a‐‐ ‐I'm rollin' right now‐‐ ‐The point is... I should have listened to Raven on my wedding day, and you should listen to her now. You've always been someone who works hard when times get tough. And that's exactly what my kids did. You didn't need your lucky coffee, or salad, or grass clippings to be good at public speaking. You just needed some confidence. The same confidence that helped you build this company. The same confidence Mom and Aunt Chelsea used to build their business. You guys, I didn't even get to tell you how proud I am of you. I honestly didn't even think you gon' make it. Oh, oh. To be fair, I, I didn't think you were gonna make it, either. - Right? Right? - No. I was just telling Chelsea today, - "These kids are always quitting." - She did. She did say that. She said it over, and over, and over, and over‐‐ I think they got it, Chels. I think they got it. I'm glad I was wrong. You guys worked really hard. - Yeah. - And this dress... ...is not half bad. You're right. They did work hard. An maybe I don't need any of that stuff. Now you're getting it. I just need to come to you guys, and you can fix everything for me. Mm, you were so close. I built my company, Brew Can Do It, by hustling. And you guys hustled today. So, here's the money you earned. Plus a little extra... ...to say "thanks." - You're welcome! - You're welcome! And that's when I realized the Baxter‐Carter‐Graysons are all the champions I need. Oh! It's, it's hard to swallow my salad around the lump in my throat. Well, it's hard to swallow your salad because there's beets in it, Nia. Look, Tess, I know you would have gotten into Campus Champion, but I am really glad that you're staying here with us. Me, too. You're the only one with creative nicknames for me. "Bruh" doesn't count. Well, salad must be working, 'cause I feel pretty lucky. - Bring it in. - Aah. Mm. This salad may be lucky, but... It is not good. Come on, Chels. You gotta take time to hype up the lentils. You can do it. You're amazing. You're number one. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Ack! No!
