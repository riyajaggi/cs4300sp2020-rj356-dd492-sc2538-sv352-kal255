 Raven's Home Was filmed in front of a live studio audience. Oh, Rae, did you need help? No, Chels, I was practicing my juggling. Aw, well good for you, Raven. Keep at it, huh? Why do you have all that stuff, though? Little z hired me to make jean jackets for his dancers for his new music video. Did you hear that? I'm gettin' the check. Signed by a 13-year-old, but it's still a check. Yeah.

Oh, yeah. Sure. What, uh... what am I permissing? Oh. Our class is taking a field trip. We're going to volunteer at the recycling center. Oh! Booker, where's your permission slip? Oh, oh, no.

Except for the one where I show up to school with no pants on. Whew! Guys, if we want to win that contest, we need to focus on coming up a with a theme for the video. We'll talk about it later. Bye. Hey, Booker, I thought you'd be a lot happier about this. Come on. Yeah, I would be. If I didn't have to deal with this. Ooh. Uh, any chance that "D" stands for "Darn good grade"? And the worst part is, my mom has to sign this. Otherwise, I can't take the make-up test. No more Chi-lective. You're finished. Finished, finished... Okay, new plan. My mom can't sign this. I just had a vision. If my mom sees this, she's not gonna let me be in the group anymore. I have to keep her from finding out. Well, that's not gonna happen. Your mom knows everything. She probably already knows about this conversation. Go, go, go, go, go! Booker, you better not be putting your sweaty gym clothes in my locker again. It took a week to get the smell of stale potatoes out. Okay, for the record, that was only because it was French fry Friday, you tater-hater. - Anyway, Nia, I need a favor. - What's up? I need you to sign mom's name on my test paper. Raven Baxter. As in Raven "You gon' get it" Baxter. Booker, what makes you think I can sign her name? 'Cause you both do the B's with, like, the small stem and the little loop-de-loop. And it took me years to master them. You think I'm gonna use it for evil? So, you're on the fence about it. Booker, I'm on the "no" side of the fence. I'm not forging mom's signature. Please, Nia. You're my sister. - Help me out. - Nope. Uh-uh, no. You were supposed to study for the test, but you didn't. Why? I don't know. Maybe I'm just bad at taking tests. I-I studied a little, but it's a lot to remember. Please just sign the test. It's not a big deal. It's a very big deal. Forgery is a crime. What are you talking about? You do it all the time, Tess! Hey. Hey, hey. This isn't about me right now. Besides, my mom taught me how to sign her name so that I'd stop bothering her while she's watching one of those lonely housewife shows. I'm not doing it, Booker. Then I'm gonna get kicked out of the group. We're not gonna kick you out of the Chi-lective. Oh, you won't have to. According to my vision, mom's gonna do it. That's why I need you to sign this test. Look, show mom that test, and I'll help you study for the make-up, but I'm no signing it for her. Bedding. Clothing. Delicates. Dang it. Cat man clark. Hey, Mr... No, Mr. Clark, hey, you can't use all three machines. - It's one per tenant. - I am not aware of that rule. I'm just saying. It's common courtesy. Oh. Well, I was here first. And my 12 cats need their pajamas cleaned. Who puts their cats in pajamas? Oh, like I'm the person who made up the phrase "the cat's pajamas"? Could you just remember to clean out your machines when you're done? I don't want to put a label on my clothes that says, "may contain hairballs." meow! May I remind you of last month's melted candy bar incident? That chocolate permanently stained whisker's lederhosen. Are you implying that I'm not smart enough to take my delicious chocolate bar out of my... I mean, what... wait... Lederhosen? He's a German short hair. Good, 'cause it was a German chocolate bar. You guys, so the host of radio eclipse live just announced that the winner of the competition will not only win 25k, but they will also sign a record deal! - A record deal? Are you serious? - That could change our lives. Can you imagine the exposure I'll get for directing the video? Wow, minnow. A little less about you, and more of us. We're the only ones repping Chi-Town. We have to bring this home. - Whatever it takes. - Yeah. Yeah, Nia. Whatever it takes. I am not signing that test for you. I think Nia's right. There's no real reason for us to cheat like this. There's three reasons for us to cheat like this. $25,000. A record deal. A trip to Cali. Yeah, that's three reasons. You know, just like the third amendment. Which is... Mm. Uh... "Do what you need to do to get what you want." Oh, come on, Nia. He is more than a week-long project. So you guys want me to go against everything I believe in, and forge mom's signature? - Yes! - Yes! Oh! So now you wanna hear my ideas? Nia, come on. We could all use this. Just think how much we could do with that money. Please, Nia. Come on. It's just one small signature. One small stem and two little loop-de-loops. No, Booker. I can't. Come on, Nia. I'll owe you forever. Look, we're twins. We shared an umbilical cord. Maybe. I'm not... I'm not sure how biology works. Please. Fine. I'll do it. You don't think I know what's going on, do you? You don't think I know. Cat man Clark wants to use all the washing machines. But I got a surprise for him. I'm about to wash everything in this house. Take off your school clothes, 'cause I'm washing 'em. Hey, good session, myron. Making a lot of progress, huh? Next time, you'll put on that other shoe. - Same time next week, huh? - All right. Hello? Yes. Hi. Yes. We are on schedule. - Oh, wow. - Oh. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Chels. That was little z's dad-ager, big z, and they're moving up the deadline. What? I'm in a problem-solving mood. - Thank you, because I... - I think I'm gonna call up myron and help him put on that other shoe. Chels. I need your help. Oh. Oh, well, I guess I could make the call from the laundry room and wait for one of the machines to open up. Huh? You would do that? Thank you, Chels. I don't know what I would do without you. You are my ride or dry. Chels? Chels, did you get lost? The laundry room is that way. It was too loud down there. I couldn't hear anything. Chels, I have a deadline to meet. I gotta wash my stuff. Yeah, well, I've got my own business to run, too. Wow. I thought you were my ride or dry. Turns out you're just dry. Rae! No, no. It's okay. You know what? I'll do it myself. I'm gonna sort through Booker's clothes, then I'm gonna head down there. Rae, listen, I'm still your ride or dry. Okay? What is this? Booker got a "D" on his test. Maybe "D" stands for, you know, "Darn good grade." Why are you acting so surprised? You signed it. Let's just write a song about being criminals. 'Cause apparently that's what we are now! Come on, Nia. Focus. Okay. Okay. All right. What do we want to say musically this time around? Look, everybody knows that we can dance, and that we have a good flow, but what's next? Well, we should try to do something totally out of the box. What about a massive food fight? Those are always fun. She knows! Run! Get downstairs, now. Mom, I can explain. It's all my fault. You know, I should have studied for that test. And then I tried to hide it from you. Well, that part is clear. The true mystery is, who signed my name? I did it, I did it! I forged your signature. Uh, that does feel really good to get off my chest. You do know that forgery is a crime, right? You know, everybody keeps saying that. Boy! The ice that you're on right now is so thin, it's cracked. All right? What got into the two of you? Mom, we didn't wanna ruin our chances for the competition. I am so tired of hearing about this contest. You know what? In fact, no more Chi-lective. You're finished. - Well, there's my vision. - That goes for both of you. Mom, we could win a record deal. No, you can't. Not now. 'cause you kids need to be reminded of your priorities. But mom, that's not fair. You always said you'll be supportive of our dreams. And right now, you're not supporting us. Booker, I will support you and your sister in whatever you choose to do. Except for lying to me and failing out of school. - Mom, we're sorry. - Yeah. You should be. And now you have to deal with the consequences. You can forget about that field trip. - But mom... - I don't want to hear any more out of either of you. Go to your rooms. What? Hi, big z. - I can't believe mom caught us. - Really? Even though you had a vision that she caught us and threw us out of the group? You are the worst psychic ever! Okay, I had a vision she was gonna throw me out of the group. I didn't know she was gonna kick you out, too. Yeah, that's exactly what the worst psychic ever would say. I told you to go to your rooms. Not go to Booker's room. You know what, since y'all just wanna do whatever y'all wanna do, why don't you tell me what else should be your punishment? I... I don't know. I-I-I think we've been punished enough. But, but, but we could, um... Lose our phones for, like, a day. Two weeks? Uh, we could stop watching tv after school. And... and I guess no more fork-knife. I would have stopped at the phones, but yeah, tack all that one, too. I'm not just mad. I'm disappointed. There's not enough punishment for that. Uh-oh. That's an unhappy face. What's wrong? I don't know what I'm gonna do about the Chi-lective. Oh, yeah. I heard that was a no-go. But it's not fair. I worked just as hard as they did, and now it's all over. I know. I know. Listen, I usually save my sage advice for my paying clients, but I'm gonna do this one pro-bono. All right? Unfortunately, Tess, - life isn't fair. - Wow. And people pay you for this? Well, I wasn't finished. Okay? And I'm doing the free trial version. Listen, Booker and Nia did wrong. You know? And now, they have to pay the price. Okay. Guess you get what you pay for. Yeah. Too bad you couldn't figure out how to fix your own problem by coming up with a way to do the video and help Booker with his studies at the same time, huh? Wow. That's it, Ms. G.! That's some good advice. Why is everyone so surprised by that? It's my job. Chels. Chelsea. Chelsea. Chelsea, look. Look! "Out of order." what are those signs for? I'm gonna put 'em on top of the washing machine. Oh, that's a shame. The machines are broken, and now you can't wash your stuff. No, no, Chels. No, no, no. Other people can't wash their stuff because I made the signs. You broke the machines on purpose? Okay, I need you to just follow along. - All right, sweetheart? - Okay. I made the signs to put on top of the washing machines, so nobody else uses them, but me. Okay, listen, I think your whole plan is out of order. - I mean, you could get in trouble. - Pssssh. - By who? - Uh, property management? They'll never know. Aah! Chels, answer the door so I can hide the evidence! - Is Ms. B. Here? - Mm-hmm. I think I came up with the perfect solution to our issue. - Really? - Tess. You knocked. So I guess the way this is gonna work is... You knock when you need something. Kinda. - Ms. B... - I don't have time for this. Okay, Rae, Rae, Rae. Listen, you punishing Booker and Nia affects Tess, too, right? The least you could do is hear her out. You got one minute. Okay. So, I was thinking, what if Nia and I help Booker study for his make-up test, by using his history lesson as inspiration for our video? And why do you think that would work? 'Cause he says he has trouble remembering stuff. But he remembers lyrics for the Chi-lective, no problem, so, if we turn lessons into lyrics... Yeah, yeah. Wow. Wow, Rae. Look at that. - I don't know, Tess. - Our first priority will be to make sure Booker passes his make-up test. - I promise. - Come on, Rae. What do you say? Okay, but he has to pass that test, and they're still grounded. If he doesn't pass the test, I don't wanna hear any more arguments for the Chi-lective. You got it, Ms. B. I hope this cat had nine lives. Not nasty. Oh, not nasty! Ooh, I'm about to use these until the cats come home. Ha ha! You guys think this is gonna help me pass the make-up test? It better. Or else I'll have to face your mom. We'll all have to face her. - Let's hear it, Booker. - Okay.

I'm sorry. Look, as your sister, I am supposed to push you to be the best you that you can be. And going forward, that's what I plan to do. And I'm gonna do the same thing for you. Really? Well, I mean, one day you might mess up, too. Mm, no. Look, Nia, I'm sorry I asked you to forge her signature in the first place. I had a vision I was going to get in trouble. I shouldn't have dragged you into it. Well, I...

You know I like to call it the Booker-plus, but I passed, - I passed. I passed. I passed. - You passed. You passed. - I passed. I passed. - He passed. He passed. Who at the door? Who at the door? Who at the door? Aah! It's... it's the Cat man from the second floor. Hey. Hey, Mr. Clark. What happened? Uh, whiskers escape again? For the last time, he does not escape. He power walks. Now, did you litter the laundry room - with these fake signs? - Mm-mm. Wasn't me. Mm-mm. I don't know who would do such a thing. Really. It sounds like someone is suffering from amnesia. I am so sorry. Well, in that case, I'm not Raven Baxter. She's down the hall. Bye. No, no... Now, before we go any further, I would like you to know that they have cameras in and outside of the laundry room. Mm, what's the matter? Cat got your tongue? No. We're gonna talk about this right now... Now, please, help your momma. Help your momma! - We're gonna talk about this later!  - Mm, bye! You have anything you want to tell us? I plead the fifth. The right to remain silent. Aw. You learned something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Write a song about it. You can go on your field trip, only because it's for school. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess! Tess. Tess. Guess what, guys? We got the results back from Radio Eclipse live. Okay. And the Chi-lective made it to the finals. That's amazing. - They didn't even... - Hey, what's going on? We are going to LA. Sync corrections by srjanapala
