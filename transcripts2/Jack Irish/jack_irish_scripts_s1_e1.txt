 This is a great opportunity, Jack. I don't want to die not knowing. I've never understood that. So you're about to get hit by a bus and you think to yourself, 'Oh! At least I now know how I'm gonna die.' How is that helpful? I'm taking a chance. I get an office, support staff, some terrific apartment in the heart of Manila. I won't be tied to one paper, one editor. Selina, she's guaranteed she'll use all my stuff. Yeah, but why Asia, why Manila? Asia's the new Middle East. Like we need another one of those. I wanna know why a guy from Ivanhoe who went to the same uni as me is trying to set up a sharia state in the Philippines.

 Ever been to Ivanhoe? This is not about us not having kids, is it? No, no. It's not. It's fine. I'm over that. The bigger question is why you won't come with me. I don't have a passport. What are you, American? Admit it - you're just too gutless to break from your petty world of old men and footy. I don't knock your career. You don't have a career, Jack. You've hardly got a life. I'll just be a sec. Me leaving is convenient for you, isn't it - no big break-up, no need to make a commitment. Don't put this onto me! You're the one doing the leaving. Yeah, but just once, you could have tried to stop me. Mm. No, the taxi's waiting. I'm already late. I'll be quick, you know me. Come on - up against the wheelie bin. That's an attractive offer. Just five minutes, mate. I guess we're not stopping at all stations, then. We don't need to, do we? Careful. You might get that child you never wanted. Anyway... Bye, Jack. My bags. I'm late. You have to marry them or they go. She has a career. They only want careers if you don't commit. I met my Ava one day, proposed the next. Sex every night. Then the Berlin Wall goes up, her one side, me the other. No more sex. The wall came down in '89, Charlie. Didn't want sex by then. Some men are never ready - not for marriage, not for kids. Gives it that special lustre, knowing these have been close to your balls, eh? Hello, Sue. Janene! Sit, please. Everyone makes such a fuss over coffee - the froth, the type of machine, the country of origin. Yet they often give we poor tea drinkers a tea bag. I hate paying for things if I know exactly how much they cost to make. A tea bag is, what - 10c, 5c? Milk and hot water. Tops, 15c a cup. The real thing here. You seem tense, Janene. No, no, no. I'm... I'm fine. How are we going at the prison? I reckon there's a few potentials. Um, refresh my memory. Strangled his girlfriend or something? Yeah. Manslaughter, five years. That's right. May I have a look? He comes up for parole next week and his passport's current. Yes, that seems like a very good choice, Janene. Tell me, have you heard from our Tina at all? She's still overseas, isn't she? No! She's back from the Philippines, apparently. Left the mission without a word. I thought you would have heard. We're not really in touch. I thought you two were close. That's funny. I was sure you would have been the first person Tina called. One for the road! You would tell us if she had, wouldn't you? Of course. Tina, call me, wherever you are. Sue's asking questions. Tina, is everything OK? Can't miss her. No! No! No, no! Shut the fuck up. Pick her up. Bruce, come on, mate! Bruce! Bloody stop, would ya? Shit! Argh! Bruce! Jessica! Jessica? Come on! This sort of spectacle's not doing either of our profiles any good, mate. I don't have Harry's money. I'll pay him as soon as I can, I promise. It's a food chain, Bruce. You're a single-cell organism, I'm barely plankton and Harry Strang's learned to walk on land. If you don't pay him, he doesn't pay me. I got bills to pay, mate. I'll pay you another way! I don't want a bloody horse, mate. It's a goody. You could sell it. A bloke called Chink has the papers. Show it to Harry. Show it to Cam. They'll tell you. Chink. Right. Sid's funeral was a funeral. Best last year, for mine. Not just sandwiches, actual cooked food. You can't have a funeral at midday and not feed people. Bloody Roy! Tighter than a Murray cod's arse. - Who died? - Roy Dexter. You know Roy - he was on the statue committee. You're not still talking about doing that statue for my old man, are you? He's been dead for 40 years. Well, now seems a good time. While he's still fresh in everyone's memory. A cold one, Stan. Yes, mate. I'm sorry to hear about Roy. You'd be sorrier if you'd gone to his wake. If the wife goes before the husband, don't go to the wake, because they never cater properly. He's the one in mourning. Woman troubles. Oh. You know that beautiful Chinese woman I was dating after Stella shot through with my cousin? No. You do. Mai Wong. Mai Wong? Yeah. I showed you photos of her. Met her on the internet. Been going out for months, and it was getting serious. She wanted to meet. You hadn't met? Oh, we'd exchanged photos. She liked what she saw. I was ready to commit. What did she see, exactly? How old was the photo? But we didn't want to rush it. We needed to be sure of our feelings. So I sent her money for a plane ticket, and you wouldn't believe it - it was a bloody scam! A scam, on the internet? I got a notice from my service provider. Apparently, I'd been talking to some bloke from the Russian mafia the whole time. Heartened to see they've finally introduced a dress code here. And I really thought I had a connection with this woman. Except it was a man, a Russian man. Well, a connection's a connection, Jack. Customary in the racing world to respect the dictates of the clock. Myself and Cam have been standing at your place for a good ten minutes. This is how the last bloke you had me chase wants to pay you, and by default, me. We don't want a horse. That much I know. It's a mug's game! Oh, I know. Feed, agistment, vets fees. People think they know what they're getting into. Coffee shops, hairdressing salons, nags - mugs' games. We're in furious agreement, hence, I don't want a horse currently chewing grass in Traralgon. Look at the white markings on the off-side fetlock, and the forehead. High neck. Who's got this horse? - Some bloke called Chink. - Chink? Chink has this horse? You sure he said his name was Chink? Yeah. But I don't want a horse. It's a while since I've been down Traralgon way. Tina, where are you? Pick up! I got your message with the number. I don't know what you want me to do with it. Call me. Please. If you don't, I'm going to go to the cops. Tina, where are you? Pick up! I got your message with the number. I don't know what you want me to do with it. Call me. Please. If you don't, I'm going to go to the cops. Is the traffic always like this? No, sometimes it's busy. We thought you were coming next week. I sent someone called Orton all the details. Surely he got them? Uh, Orton... Orton doesn't read anything. It was 12 words. Orton doesn't really come in much. Yeah, yeah... I think I've got some money in here somewhere... Is this apartment central? Yes. Close to shops? Uh, yes. This is where you're staying. You're joking? No. Is this some special saint's day? No, it's church. Open 24 hours. Here, I'll take that one. You can take this one. Just this one. I'll take them all. Give it! Uh, OK. This way. Right. See? Close to shops. Great. When does this market close? Oh, Christmas. No, no - what time does it close? Christmas. You have many, uh, cases. Yeah. I'm here for a while. Are you sure? Yes. So how many floors up is it? Uh, four. OK. What about the lift? Uh, lift is broken. Hello! Apparently, it's broken. Here. Miss Linda, this way. Here. We're here. Someone lives here. Uh, yeah. Sam. He, uh... He's in Vietnam this week. You're very lucky. Who or what is Sam? Sam, uh... Sam lives... This is his place. Yes, I can see that. What am I doing in it? Um... It's... It's a okey-dokey place. Enjoy. See you, Miss Linda. Right. OK. OK. What number is Janene's apartment? 12. OK. Let me. She is my problem. Alright. I'll wait here. I'm trusting you, Wade. Quietly. Ssh! Ssh. Ssh. We have to go, now. Stedman's out the front, and he's onto you. How? 'Cause I fucking told you to stay away from Tina. Have you heard from her, is she safe? I don't know! There's no time to pack. Come on. Well, let me put some clothes on! Shit! ..aware of the danger to this community. We have a proposal before Council to build a mosque right near to a local primary school. A primary school, for God's sake! With a park nearby, where kiddies play! This is clearly not in the best interests of our broader community. Surely, we can find many other, more appropriate, places to put their temple. Beauty, eh? Hey, Chink! For Chrissakes, don't shake his hand. It'll crush ya. What? Found him in a paddock with a rotten blanket on him. Knew right away he was a thoroughbred. Bit of wear on the legs. Yeah, well. Bit of decent tucker and a workout, he'll be right. So why didn't you buy him off Bruce? I wanted to. Couldn't afford the upkeep, you know? I tried everything, even selling my own sperms. No takers. Let's see it move. Come on, boy! Go! Yeah, that's him, alright. No question. Care to fill me in on this universe of equine knowledge? Lost Legion. 16 starts, 4 wins, 3 places. Then he got a leg problem, slowed up a bit and scratched a couple of times. Behavioural issues. Broke the leg of a stablehand. Kicked the shit out of a float, then bit a steward. They just gave up on him. A loss to the world, forgotten. Here in a paddock. Seems OK now. He's a lot better than OK, trust me. Jack'll take him. Bruce's debt, squared. Will I now? That's great! Congratulations. Alright, I'll be back in a minute. Get us the papers, Chink. Jack here can run a legal eye over them. What happened to hairdressers and coffee shops? Shit! Cam and I will come in with you, but for the sake of appearances, it's yours. Don't want our names bandied around. We'll never get odds at the track. The Lord could smile on us for saving the beast. Good day, in all. Yeah, yeah. Tops. Three-hour drive, purchase a psychotic horse, then get my hand crushed by Gippsland's least-wanted sperm donor. Irish. Sorry, who is it? Tessler Building, level 14. Jack Irish for Travis Dilthey. Please take a seat, Mr Irish. Travis is just finishing with a client. Travis, Mr Irish is here. Driscon Holdings. How may I help you? Mm-hm. Mr Irish? Travis Dilthey. Good to meet you, sir - the man who brought some very big names in this town to justice. How'd you find me? Took awhile. Through your former business partner. Drew Greer, is it? Ah. What does your company do? You've seen those protective covers for mobile phones? You make those, do you? No. We import the clips that attach to them. I'm trying to locate my younger brother. Mm-hm. I should just make it clear, Travis, I'm not a private detective. What are you, then? Well, I'm more a, ah... I mean, I trained as a lawyer. I was a lawyer. But these days... Why don't you just tell me about your brother, eh? Mm. Not much of a family resemblance. There wouldn't be. Wayne was adopted. He came into my life when I was ten years old and he's been a giant pain in the butt ever since. A lot of anger, drug problems. Had a spell in prison. But when he came out, he seemed to change. He reconnected with the church and met a girl, Janene. Had a job, of sorts. And now? Disappeared. He hasn't shown up at work or collected his car. No phone call, and he hasn't been to his apartment. You don't think that maybe he's, you know, just gone fishin'? I know something's wrong. You go to the police? He's still on parole. Now, I understand that you only normally deal with major clients. Almost exclusively. How much do you charge? 350... An hour? An hour. That's $2,800 a day. Wow, I'm in the wrong business! But fair enough. You get what you pay for. You probably want a week up-front as well. If you leave your banking details with Annie at the front desk, I'll make sure that you get it today. Great, great. So money is good in the mobile-phone clip thingy business, then? Not particularly, but I made a vow to my parents that I'd take care of him. God knows, he makes it hard. Please - any time, day or night. So could Lorna find out anything, mate? Mate? I sent you a text about anything you might have on a Wayne Dilthey. Ah, no. You sent me a text saying, 'Wayne dithering.' No, but I corrected it. Yeah, to 'Wayne filthy.' Oh, did I? Bloody predictive text. I need to get into your court database. Is Lorna about? She's stepped out. What are you trying to do, mate, apart from break my computer? When's she coming back? She stepped out two weeks ago. Oh. Bit of a long lunch, then? According to his brother Travis, Wayne's done some prison time. I bought her this little brooch with a small ruby in it. I just need some names, somewhere to start. A character reference at his trial? It'd be stylish, if I still gave Lorna the brooch, wouldn't it? Do 24-year-olds wear brooches? 25. And yes, I think they do. She was an amazing typist. I used to love to just watch her, tapping away. I'm sorry. I just find it sexy - watching women's fingers. It's erotic. No! That's not what I want. You did save this, didn't you, before I got on? Oh, that's the court. Dilthey, Wayne Ellery. Five years for armed robbery. A year in remand for racial violence, attempted murder. Charges dropped. And two-year revival tour at Whitehill for aggravated assault. He's cute. Out for three years. Found work as part of the Whitehill Prison Outreach Program. The only person who spoke up for him was someone from the church. You can always count on them to speak up for you. With both of us single again, maybe we should go on the prowl, hunt as a pack. Yes, to all the secretarial colleges! Phwoar! Think of all those typing pools, mate. Jack Irish invites me out for lunch, and naturally, after all the favours I've done him, I figured I'd be going to Florentino's, upstairs. But no. What do I get? Schnitz and tits. And soggy. And half the people that work here, I've arrested at some point or another. Fucking shoe leather in crumbs. Listen, does the name Wayne Dilthey mean anything to you? Vaguely. Dangerous? If riled. But no, just a stormtrooper. First-wave stuff, you know - legs are running but the brain's some distance behind. He works here. Good for Wayne. But he's gone missing. Probably ate the schnitzel. His brother's worried about him. It's like he knows something he's not telling me though. Close your legs, love! I'm not a gynaecologist. What do you want, Jack? Maybe just track his license plate? Popeye! Could have been a judge but got off on the wrong foot. Barry! Long time. How's the famous schnitz going down? Oh, yeah, gourmet stuff. Listen, help Jack here, will you? He'll fix up the bill. No charge, gentlemen. No, I insist. He wants to pay. I notice you've got half of Whitehill Prison working here. I guess they'd be used to prison food. Popeye. I'm, ah... I'm looking for this bloke. Yeah. Wayne came here as part of the outreach program. What program's that? Whitehill's, in conjunction with some churchy thing - giving blokes who've done time a fresh start. Ah. In a strip joint. Gentlemen's entertainment venue. We're very respectable. Wayne's working as one of our drivers, escorting the girls safely home. You're spoiling me, Judy. More sensual, Taylor! I want to see genuine chemistry. Jack here is looking for Wayne. Yeah. His brother's worried about him. Ah, well, he turned up for work a couple of days ago, then some bloke picked him up in a black four-wheel drive with tinted windows. And there's a woman he was seeing. That's Janene Ballich. Girls talk. Still not feeling the love! You remember her. Yeah. JJ. Nice kid. Bit raw. Judy showed her a routine. Has a mother in Coronet Bay, I think. Hello? SHUT THE FUCK UP! You Mary Ballich? Yeah, yeah. Hurry up, come in. Front room's almost warm. Taken all bloody day to warm it. Shit, my slipper. Fuck! So you're a lawyer? I was, sort of. It's your daughter Janene I'm trying to track down, Mary. You and every other bloody sod on earth. Little heart-starter. Oh. She's not doing that sort of work anymore. What sort of work is that? She was a model. Has her mum's legs. Tough work, modelling, eh? She was doing a bit of escorting work on the side, between modelling jobs. When was the last time you spoke to her? Day after my birthday. Not telling you the year. Ticked her off for forgetting, but she seemed real upset about something. It's actually her boyfriend that I'm trying to track down. Wayne? Mm. He's bloody stuck on her, he is. Head over heels. Bought her this beautiful diamond-studded cross. Real diamonds - not your diamante shit. Wow. He must be worth a bundle. Yeah. It's got the fuckin' neighbours rethinking what they thought about us. Must have cost him a packet. That's Wayne. Good chest, bit like yours. Can I top youse up? Oh, no. Driving. You're welcome to stay over if you want, get an early start in the morning. I'll tie the dog up. Who's the other woman in the photo? Tina something. Up herself. From money. Can I borrow this photo, just to make a copy? I'll pay you for it and bring it back. Settle down, sweetness. It's only a photo. Anything else you want is on the house. In my business, you charge for your time and you pay for other people's time. Bit like escorting. Do you know where they might go if they got themselves into trouble? Could be anywhere, but Wayne'd need to be near St Kilda 'cause he still needs his methadone. Miss Linda. Are you looking for Orton? You wanna try the rooftop? OK. Ah, I take it you're Orton? You run, I'm really grasping here for a better word, this establishment? Yes, I have that honour and duty. I was promised an apartment, a driver, an office and whatever resources I needed. Who promised you that? Selina Chase. Linda something. Hillier, right? Is Selina a friend of yours? Yeah, she's my editor on two papers. Last story she published from here was 45 cops getting shot on Mindanao. That was two years ago. I need proper facilities. Federated Press would be your best bet. They've got a coffee machine, the real thing. They do sandwiches, drinks on Fridays. Have you ever been a journalist? What, a real one? No. No, I more or less devote my life to managing offices. Well, I'm a serious journalist. I've won awards. I'm here to do proper stories and I need proper facilities. Asia's in an epoch-changing period of massive transition, and I'm here to... Wow! Is that what Asia's like? You picked up quite a bit on your drive in from the airport. You speak Filipino? No, but English is... Mandarin, Thai, Laotian, Hindi, Urdu? I have a little Italian. Ah! You're set, then. You sure Selina didn't send you here to get rid of you? That is how I secured this much sought-after posting. Please. OK. Let's start with a desk. Follow me. Right... All here to cover this epoch-changing period of massive transition. I know the story I'm covering. The terrorist, Hadji Adhib, he grew up in Melbourne. Uh-uh. Mm. Adonis, you can... Plonk yourself here. No shortage of stories. Getting the West to buy them will be a problem, unless you're lucky enough for a Westerner to get killed while you're here. Trade-weighted death - they love that. Best to use the internet around lunchtime. Doesn't crash as much. Right. Please tell me you aren't here because of a bastard relationship. That's a deeply offensive remark you wouldn't say to a man. Pete, why are you here? Wife pissed off on me. The further you run, the more significant the relationship you're running from. Manila has to have been one hell of a serious one. Please, can you just get me a proper flat? Mm-hm. Right. How's the glamorous Asian lifestyle? Actually, I've been so busy, I've hardly seen my place. I bet it's fabulous though, right? Oh, yeah. It's a great view. How's your glittering career? Oh, you know - completely and utterly satisfying. I'm actually hard at it right now. Gotcha. It didn't take us long to get to this stage of a distant relationship, did it? I suppose not. Call me if you can think of anything to say. I will try very hard. Travis Dilthey, Driscon Holdings. Travis, it's Jack Irish. I reckon I've located your brother, mate. Ah! Good man, Jack. Where is he? He's at the Palms Motel on Glendon Street in a ground-floor room. They said you were good. Who's 'they'? Look, I'm caught up with something right at the present. Could you give me 20 minutes, and I'll call you straight back. You'll call me back? You want to meet me out here or what? Just let me check, and I'll call you back. Check with whom? He's close. The Palms Motel, ground floor. Wayne? My name's Jack Irish. Your brother Travis sent me. He's a bit worried about you. Yeah, just a tick. Hi, mate. Alright! Alright, you've got family problems. Alright. Travis died two years ago. What? I said, my brother died two fucking years ago. Who bloody sent you? Wayne! Wayne, don't hurt him! Someone who said he was your brother. He makes clip things for mobile phones. He paid me to look for you. You're lying to me. I'm not, mate. I saw you tailing me in that bloody Yank tank. He's not armed! He wouldn't have come knocking if he knew anything. Listen to her, mate. We've both been set up. Who would tail someone in a Studebaker? He might be able to help. Fuck! Get up. Shut your mouth and get in there. Hey, listen - you two really need to get out of here. He's not part of it, Wayne. He's wearing a cardigan! I'm not, Wayne. I mean, I am wearing a cardigan, but I'm not... Shut up! Alright. Go and start the car. No, better - take his car. You're not taking the Studebaker, are you? Come on, mate! Oh, shit. Hey, Wayne? I can probably track down who's behind this, you know. I found you, didn't I? I know who's behind it. Well, do you want to fill me in? Don't worry, you'll meet 'em... ...any tick from now. Wayne. I am genuinely filled with sadness. We are a brotherhood committed to a cause, and you know there's only one way to resign. Shit! Stop! You can come out now, Janene. Clean this shit up. She's driven off. Shit. Who's he got in there, then? That would be you, Jack Irish! Shit! Get in after him! We've got to go to the police. And tell them what, that you just rang me from a phone box which is by a motel with a dead body in it? I didn't do it. Your DNA's all over the room of a bloke you've been stalking. Looking for. Then he ended up putting an extra centimetre of lead in his brain. You're the lawyer. Did anyone see you? No-one will admit to being there. This place is like a resort for people wanting to wreck their marriages. These guys knew my name. I've been set up. Now this chick's driving around in my Hawk. You also have to sort out a proper stable for your horse. Can't have it wandering around a paddock. It's a thoroughbred. He is joking, isn't he? Life goes on. It's not all about you, Jack. So where are we dropping you? The Tessler Building, in the city. Tessler Building. Level 14. Do you know if it's got chilly outside? Sorry? Yeah. Yeah, it's a bit cold. Dear. I didn't bring a coat. Winter surprises me every year. You look a little roughed-up. And did you report your car stolen? My phone was in the car. Exactly when did you notice that it was missing? Exactly when I went to get in it and noticed that it was missing. Who is she? Misunderstanding - I ask the questions, you answer. Your pride and joy goes missing, you don't think to pop to a police station and report it. That's odd. Is it? Why'd you kill Wayne Dilthey? Misunderstanding - I didn't. Sir? Excuse me. We have an eye witness who saw someone of your description leaving the building with a gun. That's bullshit. I've never met him. What reason would I have to kill Wayne Dilthey? I would have thought $25,000 deposited into your bank account this morning would have been quite a reason. You're making this up as you go along. I think he's answered enough questions for the moment, Ma'am. I need a brief word with my client in private. So... ...what's happening here? Clearly being done over by experts, mate. My car's been stolen, I've lost a client and now they're trying to pin a murder on me. Apart from that, all good. All good. So... ...any alibi of any kind? I'll settle for anything at this point. OK. You're free to go, Mr Irish. I am? Your girlfriend came forward. Linda's here? No, the new model, the one that you were humping at the time of the murder. Ah. Yeah. She's waiting for you. We'll need your passport. I don't actually have one. That's good. 'Cause I don't think you're ever going to use one again. I need that paperwork on my desk first thing tomorrow morning, Tregear. You will tell me what the fuck's going on some time very soon, won't you? As soon as I know myself. Come on, babe! Let's get you home. You poor thing! What a day you've had. Do you want to tell me who you are? Where's Tina? Who's Tina? My sister Tina! I don't know where she is. I don't know what you're talking about. What, really? Yeah, really. None of this is making any sense to me. I don't know who you are. Well, then, you're useless to me. Really? Tina. What is it you most fear? My husband, when he's been drinking. I fear the world, at the moment. When I saw my bedroom door open when my uncle was staying over. I mean, girls used to call me that at school, and I kept thinking... I guess, losing Joanne... ...my wife. I don't watch the news - all this violence. I... I sense something terrible is going to happen. Tina, I want you to share with us your greatest single fear. You're safe here. You're among friends. OK. My greatest fear, um... It's a really stupid one. These numbers here - 76703 et cetera, et cetera. What do they mean? Are they a bank account, a phone number, a locker somewhere? I must have pressed them by accident. They mean nothing. OK. Who's Pier Okant? It's a Dutch guy that I was seeing. Dutch? Hm. Where is he now? I don't know. He left. He, um... That's why I texted Janene. Thought that she might know. I would never betray them. OK. I believe you. We just had to make sure. So go on, you can piss off. Take your shit with you. Go on. Your bag's over there. Just let her go, OK? Go down the track a couple of K, you'll come to the main road. You can hitch a ride from there. I just want to be someone who's good and brave. When I was a, um... When I was a kid, this really mad, vicious dog - just came out of nowhere and... - Come on. ...he jumped on me, and they couldn't pull him off, and... ...it almost killed me. So yeah. Dogs are my greatest fear. It's all in the past now. You're safe here with us. Captions by CSI Australia So who was she and why did she alibi me? Sarah Longmore, daughter of... What, the Attorney-General? Hello. Was wondering when you were gonna show up. How do we know who to trust? Where's Tina? I know she's back. Janene, isn't it? Why don't you just come past my office? Like they'd let me get to you. What is Janene Ballich doing on my doorstep at 7am asking questions about Tina? You made quite a name for yourself as a journalist back home, didn't you? Quite the troublemaker in Australia. Who are you again? See, troublemakers, they don't do well here.
