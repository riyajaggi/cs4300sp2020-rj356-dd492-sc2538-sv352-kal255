 Everyone connected to my stitch-up
has been murdered
 or died in an accident -
Wayne Dilthey, Travis Dilthey,
 Janene Ballich,
and Sarah's sister's still missing.
 We found Tina.
It's connected to a prison...
 Fuck!
..to the Church...
 How do we know who to trust?
 They're only powering Christian
towns.
 Boyd, Fraser.
 This is a very different country
to the one you're used to.
 Troublemakers,
they don't do well here.
 Listen, I need to go to Mindanao.
 I'm meeting a contact who says
he can get me to Hadji Adhib.
 ADONIS: Villagers are being
driven out of this region.
 By a little outfit called
Holman-Dang.
 (Heavy blows on car roof)
 So, who was throwing rocks at us
last night?
 Not the terrorists. We'd be dead now.
 Scared locals, more likely...
 ...people who don't want this
to happen to them.
 What happened here?
 Nothing good.
 People either fled or got killed.
 And the bodies?
 LINDA: Hello.
 Hello!
 I'm Linda.
 What's your name?
 Where's your mummy and daddy?
 Are you hungry,
do you want some food?
 Something to eat?
 Come.
 (Both speak local language)
 Linda!
Linda?
 Linda!
 (Rifle clicks)
 (Speaks local language)
 Boss? (Speaks local language)
 (Shouts)
 (Both speak local language)
 Come.
 Kneel! Kneel down.
 Police, police!
 Move! In the car!
They'll be here any tick.
 In, in!
 In!

 (Cheering)
 Um, everyone here
knows my young son, Josh.
 Come on, stand up, Josh.
Give them a wave. Say hello.
 Now Josh once asked
his dear, old nan
 whether she'd prefer to be buried
or cremated when she died.
 Quick as a whip, she replied,
 'I don't know.
Why don't you surprise me?'
 (Laughter)
 Now, life is full of surprises,
isn't it?
 So when someone as young as Tina...
 ...as beautiful, inside and out...
 Well, it's a shock.
 It's hard to fathom.
 Get it together, Rob.
 Your wife and children are sitting
right in front of you.
 But I don't know why
we're feeling so sad.
 I mean, Tina certainly isn't.
She's partying with Jesus himself!
 (Cheering)
 We know she is!
 Like everyone here. You are paid-up
members of a special club. Why?
 Because you believe.
 OK, you're on.
 ♪ I love Jesus... ♪
 Apparently, this was the service
your sister wanted.
 She was 35,
and mauled to death by dogs!
 She was back on the drugs.
 I don't believe that.
 The autopsy was unequivocal -
it was all through her bloodstream.
 And you believe that, unequivocally?
 Please. I don't want to argue.
 Yeah, you're right. Let's not.
 If that creep in there would like
to meet Jesus, I will help him.
 Sarah! Well,
someone needs to care about her!
 You'll join us at the cemetery?
 Ah, serve for Jesus? Could you?
 Sure, yeah.
 Here you go.
Oh! Ah...
 It's... It only takes notes.
 Oh, right.
 You and Tina... Were you close?
 Ah, I'm a friend of her sister's.
 Oh.
 She was very kind, Tina,
when I was having troubles.
 We're having a good-grief meeting
here for her tomorrow.
 A what meeting?
Good grief.
 It's where we turn our grief from
a negative force into a healing one.
 Ah. I should come along.
I could do with a bit of healing.
 Technically,
it's only for Level 2s and above.
 But given you're family,
I'm sure you'd be very welcome.
 Oh, OK.
Is Pastor Rob going to be there?
 No. Pastor Rob wouldn't have time
for a little group like ours.
 Right. Alright, see you then.
 Cheers.
Ah...
 ♪ He's alive, alive. ♪
 It's catchy.
You OK?
 Yeah, I'm alive!
 No, I've got my own chauffeur.
 Oh, why are funeral processions
so slow? God, they're dead!
 They don't have to worry about
having an accident.
 Oh, Tina would have hated this!
 She would have hated it.
 (Toots horn) Come on, come on!
 Pull over.
Huh?
 Pull over. Can you stop the car?
What? What's wrong?
 I want to get something
for her wake.
 What are you doing?
 I need something in a lime green.
 Is that her favourite colour?
 No! It's the colour she most hated
in the whole world,
 and she'd love it
that I wore it for her.
 We don't have anything
in a lime green.
 Oh.
 Oh, hang on...
 Oh, that's disgusting! (Laughs)
 She would hate this!
 Is your change room through here?
 (Chuckles)
 Sarah? We're going to be late.
 What do you think?
I think we're going to be late.
 Come here.
 Hey, hey! Let me take you home.
 It's fun!
Let me take you home.
 Come on, take a risk!
You can look in the mirror.
 I think you're being...
 What, unstable, unhinged?
 I was going to say, sad.
 Hm?
 I'll just find someone else.
I don't want you. I don't need you.
 Listen...
No. Get out!
 I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere. Hey, hey...
 It's OK.
 I saw you talking to your father.
 You saw me standing with him.
 Thought you might have been
burying the hatchet.
 There wasn't one handy.
 Is he really that bad?
 Don't you read the polls?
 No.
 There's only so many bloody-minded
decisions you can make
 before your soul chucks it in.
 Well, there is no shortage of
father issues in the world, is there?
 Mine was killed starting a pub brawl
when I was a kid.
 Is this the same footie legend
 that I'm being asked to immortalise
in bronze?
 Yeah.
 Well, you know -
you kick 112 goals in a season,
 and they'll forgive you for anything.
 No way!
 Struth! Is this really
how we want Bill Irish remembered?
 No.
 What exactly did you promise her?
 Yeah. Maybe there's a way out of it.
 I just said, 'The job's yours, 100%.'
 I gave her my word,
on my wife's grave.
 There's not much wiggle room
in that, then, is there?
 It's upside-down, surely.
 You reckon that might be the head
there?
 Eh?
 'No.5.'
 I still can't work out what club
this bloke played for.
 Five'd be Bernie Quinlan, surely.
 Bernie Quinlan?
Then it's a bloody desecration!
 Hm.
 TV: It's going to boil
for about 45 minutes or so.
 It really depends on how fresh...
 (Switches TV off)
 (Knock at door)
 It's me. I found these...
 I found these at the market.
I figured she'd be size 5.
 How is she?
 Yeah, the doctor's been back.
She's still in shock.
 She seems physically OK.
 Adonis is getting nowhere,
trying to find any family.
 Truth is...
 ...daughters aren't as valuable
as sons, in some parts.
 (Speaks Polish)
 I understand enough Italian
to know that that was Polish.
 Was it?
 Drink?
Sure.
 From what I gather,
asking around the island,
 that was the only village
that wouldn't sell to Holman-Dang.
 Fishing is a dead-end game
if you're not near water.
 They held out -
ten generations of fishermen.
 So they held out,
and now they're gone.
 Here.
 Could Holman-Dang be a bank
for Hadji Adhib?
 He has to fund his operation
somehow.
 Could be him.
 Could be warlords.
 Or could be the power plant.
 Why the hell would any of that lot
be sending 25 grand to Jack Irish
 in Fitzroy?
 Miss Hillier?
 Glad to see you in one piece.
 Bloody dangerous place you chose
to go sightseeing the other day.
 Good news travels fast.
Lucky for you it does.
 I'm the one who sent Fraser
and the boys out looking for you.
 Can't tell you how thrilled they
were, heading into Hadji territory.
 You think it was him
who destroyed the village?
 Who else? That kid waving a gun
in your face was one of Hadji's.
 But wasn't it a Muslim village?
 You're looking for reason and sense
from terrorists.
 If they're not shooting at us,
they're shooting each other.
 And none of them think much of
journos. Get back to Manila.
 I'd love to, but I'm
following a story about a bank.
 The Holman-Dang Bank.
You heard of it?
 Yeah, I've got
a Christmas account with them.
 What are you talking about?
 Don't you want to go home?
 I can't get out of this shithole
fast enough.
 Someone logged on to my computer
at 10:30pm the other night.
 Well, rules me out. I clock off
at five. It's a religion.
 Why are you sniffing around
the Tina Longmore case?
 Well, I'm nothing if not thorough.
 She was a druggie. She was on heroin.
 She was a druggie four years ago.
 That's a long time, between now
 and sitting on a beanbag,
listening to Nirvana.
 So? People go back.
 Yeah. You know she was a friend
of the late Janene Ballich?
 Stop trying to make this sound
more interesting than it is.
 Believe me, I'd like to.
 Oh, and Barry?
Mm-hm?
 Keep your arse off my chair.
 (Phone rings)
 ANSWERPHONE: You've called Jack
Irish. Leave a message after the
beep.
 LINDA: Ah, hi. It's me.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
 Listen, about this bank...
 Hi. You OK?
 There's a link, this
Holman-Dang Bank thing of yours.
 It may be more complicated
than I thought.
 They're operating here in Mindanao,
but I have no idea what's going on.
 This young boy was
shot in front of me,
 and there's this gorgeous girl...
 Ah, shit. Are you alright?
 Not particularly.
 Listen, I just need you to tell me
everything you know.
 I know bugger-all, really.
It's connected to some
 happy-clapping church here, I think,
but I don't know how.
 I reckon you should get out of there.
 Right. And go where? You've taken
my name off the answering machine.
 Well, people kept leaving messages.
 Look, it's sort of late. Do you
reckon we can talk about this
tomorrow?
 'This?'
 Is someone with you?
 What a bloody mess.
 (Phone rings)
 Yeah?
Fuck you, Jack!
 I have been sitting here, wanting
you, wanting to hear your voice,
 thinking every day about
getting on a plane and coming home.
 And now I'm up to my neck
in your Holman-Dang shit.
 I mean, I've hardly cleared Customs
and you've moved on. Fuck you!
 Was that her?
 Yeah.
 Do you still feel anything?
 Yeah.
 Good.
 An arsehole wouldn't.
 So you've never lived anywhere
other than Fitzroy?
 No.
North Fitzroy, but that wasn't right.
 I could never live
on your side of the river.
 Have you been thinking about it?
 The less they see of you, the better,
so will you wait in the car?
 Yeah.
So, in the car?
 Yes, in the car. It's not hard.
 No.
 MARK: We're here, Jesus.
EVERYONE: Praise be his name.
 Let us release Tina with words that
describe our loving memories of her.
 Jess?
 Kind.
 Courageous.
 Truthful.
 Warm-hearted.
 Janene Ballich...
 ...she was a friend of Tina's, right?
 I was just thinking how...
Well, how weird it is,
 that she died the same week as Tina.
 She was a member of this church too,
right, as Tina?
 Yeah. Yes, it's very sad.
 We weren't really close with Janene
though.
 She was a Level 3 and didn't really
mix with anyone below that.
 Tina always did.
 Sorry, a Level...
3.
 I've just been made a 3 too.
 Despite everything,
you made it, Mark.
 Why? What...
 Ah, my wife kind of fell out with
the Church,
 and she made a bit of a fuss.
Ah.
 Is your wife still...
 I don't have any contact.
 And the Church helped me realise
that, for my own sake,
 I had to cut off all ties with her
and my son.
 You're kidding me?
 I'm sorry,
who makes the call on these levels?
 Pastor Rob
and the Council of Elders.
 The higher up you are,
the more time you spend with Rob.
 And that's all based on
your time with the Church
 and your good works and...
 Money?
I'd imagine money comes into it.
 Yes, we do pay a tithe -
10% of our salary.
 Now,
could we return to releasing Tina?
 Yeah! Yeah, carry on.
 Tina, I release you from our love
into his.
 It's just that a wife and child
is a pretty big price to pay for...
 Please! Jack...
 Sorry. Yeah, I... I release her too.
 Pastor Rob wants a private word
with you, Mr Irish.
 Oh! Well.
 Wonder what level that makes me,
then.
 All in less than an hour, as well.
 He just talked himself into
some sort of grief meeting.
 He's with Shand now.
 I don't know!
He just asked him up there.
 Yes, we are monitoring it.
 I'm on my way.
 Where to, boss?
Via Crucis, fast.
 (Starts engine)
 Ah! Jack, isn't it?
Please, come in, take a seat.
 Can Bev get you a cup of tea?
 I'd love a cold one,
if you've got any beers.
 (Laughs) No, we're dry, I'm afraid,
but we have all sorts of teas.
 No, it's OK.
 So, what do you make of
our humble abode?
 Well, there's money
in them there Jesus.
 (Laughs) Believe in him,
and he will share his riches.
 Oh. I reckon
I must have read the wrong Bible.
 It was all, original sin and
the fires of hell when I was a kid.
 Oh, no, we don't go in for that
much here, no.
 One of our core beliefs is helping
people to flourish in God's embrace.
 The gift of wealth we see as
part of his blessings to us.
 Ah. So the more money,
the better for you guys, huh?
 Success and wealth, he reserves for
those who truly believe.
 But I get the sense you have
a less than charitable view of us.
 Oh, nah...
 I'm forming an impression.
 Tell me, would you trust me enough
to answer a few questions honestly?
 Sure, as long as you answer
a few of mine, honestly.
 Question for question.
 We find that people can't hide
their true feelings from a camera.
 Do you do this for everyone?
 Ah, yes, we do, in fact.
 I want you to understand, Jack,
that we have nothing to hide.
 Well, I don't mind being filmed
 as long as I can
turn that thing around on you
 and film you as well.
Delighted to. OK.
 So let's start with,
what do you believe in?
 Ah, that they hike petrol prices,
 and that the Lions are a no-show
for the Grand Final this year.
 You see,
the key to this is to be truthful.
 Right. What do I believe in? Ah...
 That weight for age, there are
more decent people than arseholes,
 but for some reason, the arseholes
seem to inherit the earth.
 So you're a cynic.
Mm.
 Do you believe in an afterlife?
Hang on, Vicar. My turn.
 Do you think it's odd that
three people from your church
 all disappeared within the same week?
 Um, sad, yes. Odd, no.
 I have pastoral care
for over 30,000 people.
 I think I see too many deaths.
 Why does someone with a Law degree
 work as a bagman
and a debt collector?
 Well, I prefer the company
of honest men.
 You seem to know a lot about me.
 You're avoiding the question.
What are you trying to achieve?
 Just a little bit of peace, you know?
 Tell me about your Whitehill Prison
outreach program.
 Well, we've reduced the recidivism
rate by 90%
 by finding them gainful employment.
 As what, thugs for hire?
 Why'd you choose me?
 Why was I set up?
 I... I don't know
what you're talking about,
 but I do know that
we choose ourselves.
 Come on, let's do this for real.
 What's your greatest fear, Jack?
 Isn't it true that
you lost your wife?
 Would it be fair to say that
 losing someone
who's very close to you
 and being powerless
to do anything about it,
 that is your greatest fear?
 Obviously.
 Yeah, I reckon losing someone you
love is as bad as it gets.
 That would be my greatest fear.
Isn't it everybody's?
 Well, it's certainly mine, yes.
 Right. So Tina's death
would have really rattled you, then?
 The death of any parishioner is...
I'm not talking about
 any parishioner,
I'm talking about your mistress.
 OK. Let's do this at another time
when you're less confrontational.
 Or better yet, why don't you
come to one of my sermons?
 You can see what this place
really brings to people's lives.
 Ah, Lazarus is back,
come to show me out, I assume.
 I thought I asked you
to wait in the car.
 SARAH: I AM in the car.
 But I'm in the car park.
 Oh! You wanted me
to stay in the car park as well?
 You should have made that clear.
 Tell me, where did you first meet
Travis Dilthey?
 Ah, the Tessler Building. Why?
 Right. Do you want me to come
and pick you up?
 Yeah, that'd be good, if you're,
you know, not too busy or anything.
 She was at the church...
 ...and she followed me
all the way here.
 I'll bloody do it!
I'm not frightened.
 I'll walk up to her
and say it straight -
 'Now, look, you're a nice girlie,
 but I think you should
head back to art class.'
 That might damage our friendship
with Jack.
 The cost of war! The committee can't
grant a commission of this magnitude
 to a sheila who makes someone's head
look like a cow pat.
 Yeah.
 Hello! Three gorgeous men.
 They've seen my exhibition,
haven't they?
 Yeah, I'd put money on it.
 So, the Tessler Building -
did you go inside?
 No. Thank you.
No, you told me to stay in the car.
 I followed Dale and this other guy.
 What'd the other guy look like?
 Buzz cut, older.
You wouldn't mess with him.
 Mm.
 I've got the feeling
he's the one who urinated on me.
 Oh. Incoming.
 You should just
put them out of their misery.
 Absolutely no way.
 Look, it might be better
if you broke it to her, Norm,
 because you'd be gentler with her
than I would be.
 (Grumbles)
 Round 2?
Mm.
 I think he's going to ask you
for a date.
 No, no.
 I thought I might have
dropped something, but...
 Round 3.
 Jack, Jack? Could we, ah...
 Could we have a private word
with ya?
 Certainly, Wilbur.
 Ah, it's about your father's statue.
 Sarah is so excited.
She's brimming with ideas.
 You've seen her work,
you know what she's capable of.
 About the work...
I knew it would speak to you.
 It does, it does. But...
 ...do you think it might be
a bit modern?
 Not for us, but for the older
members of the club.
 Yeah.
They're not as up on art as us.
 I think, with your passion,
you'll be able to talk them round.
 Just tell them it was the same
with the Sydney Opera House.
 She's so excited!
 I hate the bloody Opera House.
 I want to give you this.
 You can have it.
 I thought you'd be
on the first flight out.
 Well, they pay me by the word,
 and I think there's a few words
in this one.
 She's going to be a handful.
 International headstamp code 314.
 That would be March 2014.
 'MIC' will be some bullshit name -
 Military Industries Corporation
or something.
 That won't exist.
 It's the way reputable arms dealers
 flog their stuff
to known terrorists, I suppose.
 Yeah, I know, but nobody's talking.
 You know we can't take her with us?
 What's her name?
 Fatma.
 MAN: Hi.
 Can YOU tell me where I am?
 I fly in, I fly out.
I never know where I am anymore.
 Really?
 It's on the towels.
 (Gunshots, screaming)
 Excuse me.
 You're OK?
 It's fine. Come on.
 Hey?
Yeah?
 I bought you something
to mark your horse's first outing.
 Oh! But it's just
a little country meeting.
 Yeah,
but it's important to do it right.
 All famous horse owners have one.
 A trilby.
 Wow. If you're not wearing one,
no-one will take you seriously.
 Really?
Mm-hm.
 Look at that.
 Thank you very much.
 Come on!
 Stick it on your head.
(Laughs)
 (Wolf-whistles) Beautiful!
 And the hat wouldn't make sense
without the jacket.
 (Laughs)
 Who are you, buying me this?
 Harry would be very pleased.
 Why don't you come with us today?
 Might be nice for you
to be with someone.
 I WILL be with someone.
I'm having dinner with Charlie.
 You're having dinner with Charlie?
Mm-hm.
 I've worked for that German
for 15 years,
 I've never been invited to dinner
once.
 Maybe if you got your joints right.
 (Phone rings)
 Thanks for the hat and the coat.
 You look gorgeous.
 Irish.
Jack, darling? Sybil.
 Who?
Bobby Warburton's agent.
 Ah, yes.
I've tracked down that payment.
 I was wondering
if we could catch up.
 I'm actually heading out for the day,
 but I could certainly
send my secretary,
 um, my associate, to come and meet
you instead, if that's alright.
 (Sighs) Memory lane.
 All this rich history.
What a legacy he leaves behind.
 'Life is but a walking shadow...'
 You told Jack, my junior associate,
that you found something.
 Ah. Your junior was right.
Bobby went behind my back.
 He was paid off the books.
 I've been his agent now
 since I first saw him play
one of the Ugly Sisters.
 Then, of course,
there was the production where...
 You said you had a name, an address?
 No, but he definitely received
an amount of $15,000 -
 he never mentioned it-
from someone called Holman-Dang.
 Ha! And I never saw any of it -
not one red cent.
 Holman-Dang.
Yeah, we know about them.
 So nothing else? There's no
booking name or no contact?
 But if you do locate the person
who booked him, I would like my 15%.
 I can't stay mad with him!
I never could.
 '3rd January.
A wintry, wintry summer's day.
 Another opening night looms.
The old fluttering begins.'
 Oh, you'll love this -
'And I stand, centrestage.'
 Oh, Jack. Sorry about the wait.
 Takes longer than my second marriage
these days.
 Ha! Very good. Nice touch.
 You look like an owner.
 Now, remember -
we have no interest in your nag.
 I want distance between us.
 We don't know you,
you don't know us.
 How much did you back him for?
 We didn't.
Not the time to show our hand.
 Expectation is the enemy.
 What about prize money?
 $800 for the win.
 It cost 1,000 bucks to get him here.
The long game, Jack.
 Eyes on the prize -
 the McGrath Cup.
 That's why we're trialling him out
here - minimum chance of being seen.
 Harry, Cam?
 Jack?
Clive!
 What brings you boys
all the way out here?
 The hot dogs.
 (Piss off!)
 RACE CALLER:
Started good, in a great line.
 African Prince came out of the gates
like a bullet
 and went straight to the front.
 Greta's Dream coming after it,
then came Boozy Lunch,
 and Lost Legion
from a long way back.
 Muscle memory kicking in,
competitive juices flowing.
 Lost Legion takes the lead,
and at the 200m mark...
 Come on. Come on. That's the way.
 Obsidian Dragon next,
but this is a big lead.
 Lost Legion, from the back,
storms to victory...
 Yes!
 ...and wins it
by two or three lengths.
 '29th April 1990.
Saw Branagh's Henry V.
 Frankly, he was not up to the role.
 Crucified the pentameter,
and as for...'
 Sorry - do you have all his diaries?
 Compelling, aren't they?
He left them to me, the whole set,
 with a view that, one day,
we'd publish.
 Do you have this year's?
 Didn't exactly light up the track.
Pretty average field too, I reckon.
 (Mobile rings)
A win's a win.
 Sign of a true champion -
runs just as fast as he needs to.
 Hello?
What day did you see Bobby Warburton
 playing the part of Travis Dilthey?
 Ah, Tuesday the 3rd, I think.
 So it'll be in and around that date.
 I might have an address.
 Is this where people usually come
for auditions?
 Yeah, Cynthia.
Um, let's look at Race 7.
 1,800 on a heavy track is no
walk in the park. Who do we like?
 I know that guy.
 Oh, I know him as well. That's, um...
 Ah, Warren, Warren...
 Warren Tissot?
 I met him at the Tessler Building.
 What's he doing here?
 (Dials)
 Aloha.
 I'm in Bali, not Hawaii,
and I can't talk.
 I've got an airline shuttle bus
coming.
 I'll be home tomorrow,
and I need my car back.
 How's it going?
It rained.
 And how's married life?
 He's in the toilet. This is
the eighth day of his 24-hour bug.
 (Toilet flushes)
The bus is coming in three minutes!
 SIMON: Coming!
 I'm outside of an address,
and there's no name on the building,
 nothing on the gate.
I want to find out who owns it.
 Ask them?
Not really that sort of place.
 Get on to the Council - find out who
pays the water rates, electricity.
 I'm getting on a plane.
(Vomits)
 Right - what's the address?
 Jack, not John. Am I right?
 That is you. What are you doing
out here, stalking me or something?
 Something, yeah. What about you -
what are you doing here?
 Just delivering keys to tenants.
This is another building of ours.
 Oh. Who are the tenants?
I don't know.
 I'm just told to deliver the keys.
None of my beeswax, really.
 This isn't the lot that you had
trouble with, is it? Strange mob.
 No hellos, no how-do-you-dos. You
meet the gamut in my line of work.
 I know you're not meant to
judge someone you first meet,
 but as old Napoleon would say...
I should go.
 Good to see you, mate.
Right, yep.
 (Mobile rings)
 Irish.
The address you're at is a factory,
 but I have no idea what it makes.
It's very odd.
 There's firewalls, security,
but as far as I can find out,
 the building is registered to
a church, the Way of the Cross.
 Ah, now there's a familiar name.
Thanks for that.
 Ah, do you mind
if we follow this truck?
 Boss? Is the track going to be
heavy or not?
 We'll take that as a yes.
 (Knock at door)
 I got us a flight back to Manila
tomorrow at 11am.
 What about Fatma?
 Adonis couldn't find
any of her family.
 But there's this orphanage.
It's pretty basic...
 No, no. I'm not leaving her here,
no way. Not in this place.
 I thought so.
 I got her a ticket too.
 It's borderline kidnapping,
but we'll worry about it later.
 You better get packed.
 Hello?
 My name's Linda Hillier.
 Whoever owns this phone
recently tried to kill me.
 I'm an Australian journalist, and I
would like to interview Hadji Adhib.
 He can call me on this number.
 What about Here Comes The Man,
Race 3, Moonee Valley?
 This little excursion wouldn't have
anything to do with the urinator?
 I suppose letting it go
is out of the question?
 Yeah.
Genetic impossibility, I'm afraid.
 So 500 on Race 4, No.6.
 What was that filly you liked
at Warwick Farm, Cam?
 Honduran Cigar.
 Where the dickens are we?
 I hope you're going to fix me up
for petrol.
 Hi. I'm a bit early.
 I wanted to see
if you had a piece of wood that...
 Oh! Sorry. I didn't
realise you had clients here.
 They're not clients.
 They're from the bank,
aren't they, Charlie?
 I haven't had time
to prepare the Himmel und Erde.
 Oh, well, that's alright.
I don't mind.
 I wanted to make a sculpture
for Jack in memory of his car,
 so I need to make a stand for it.
 What's his favourite timber
to work with?
 Should be chipboard.
 Well, what's your favourite timber?
 King Billy pine. Very rare.
 It wasn't
before he started working with it.
 MAN: Thanks. Cheers, mate.
 Come.
I'll find you a piece that survived.
 Are you wanting to sell?
 Not that much.
 Where are they taking us?
 No idea.
 How badly do you want to know
what's in the back of this truck?
 Well, we've come this far.
 Stop here.
 Look.
 Yeah, yeah.
I saw it finish in Race 3.
 Harry? Could you pass me
the briefcase, please?
 Stay here.
Should we just back up and go home?
 Probably.

 (Switches music off)
 (Mobile rings)
 I think that might be for you.
 JACK, ON RECORDING: Yeah,
I reckon losing someone you love
 is as bad as it gets.
 That would be my greatest fear.
Isn't it everybody's?
 Take me back straightaway.
What?
 Did you ever meet Jack's wife?
 Once. She came in to buy a table.
 Good eye for detail, like yours.
 He must have been a complete mess
when she died.
 He's not a mess now?
 I've been trying to call you.
Will you give me a buzz?
 And don't go home, OK?
 I've never had apple with potato
before.
 Himmel und Erde - heaven and earth.
 Mm. It really works.
Opposites often do -
 heaven and earth, fire and water...
 ...beauty, nincompoop.
 OK, so, walk on.
 'Cause there's such love in the air
tonight. I can feel it.
 You can feel it. Blah, blah, blah.
 Then there are those people
 that keep running into the same
old brick walls again and again.
 That's where I want
the spotlight to hit me here.
 As for those brick-wall idiots...
 Don't worry, I won't say 'idiots'.
 ...I have some bad news for you.
 His day of reckoning is coming.
 Goodnight.
Auf Wiedersehen. (Laughs)
 Love is the thing that connects us
all. Love him, love each other.
 Ah, Romans 13:8.
 Then I'll just throw it to the band.
 (Line rings)
 Come on, pick up.
 (Rings)
 Hey, it's me again.
Just call me, will you?
 (Cheering)
 You know...
 ...I feel sorry for those people
that could never feel the joy
 that fills our hearts tonight,
because there is such love
 in the air tonight.
 AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!
I can feel it.
 You can feel it, can't you?
 (Applause and cheering)
 Praise the Lord, hallelujah!
 Love is the thing that
connects us all.
 Love him, love each other.
 That is his message.
 Romans 13:8...
 'Owe no-one anything
except to love each other.'
 Love allows us
to turn our back on a hostile world.
 (Audience cheers)
 In love,
we find our only true safe place.
 (Cheering and clapping)
 (Explosion)
