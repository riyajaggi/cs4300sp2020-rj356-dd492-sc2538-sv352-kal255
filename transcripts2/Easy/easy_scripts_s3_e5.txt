 Okay. [shutter whirring] [Penny] Mom, we have to go now. Just... give me like, three more minutes. Go eat something. [girls giggling] [Penny] That was bad. God damn it. Can you... Can you... Penny, seriously. - I want you to get behind me, guys. - All right. - I have asked you five times. - Fine. [sighs] - [Kyle] What do you think? You like it? - Mm-hm.

 - It's really good. - Yeah? You like Indian food, Penny? Yeah. What's your favorite? This. What is it? That's naan. It's, like, Indian bread. It's sorta like pita. - You've had pita before. You like it. - Yeah. You can kind of scoop up the curry with the naan. You can kind of use it like a little... - a little mitt. - [Allen] What's... What's this stuff? That's a potato. That's... That's, like, a green pea curry. [phone rings] You know, I probably didn't have Indian food until I was in college. - [Allen] Really? - [Kyle] Yeah. I was probably 19-20, - until I had that. - [Penny] Wow. - [Kyle] So you're ahead of your time. - [Allen] Mm. Your mom introduced me to all these things. She had, you know, much better taste than I did. Andi, it's Ryan. I'm sorry that I'm just now getting back to you. It's been sort of a crazy... 24 hours. Uh... Sadie... surprised me last night by coming into town. [chuckles] And she just... showed up at my show and, uh... Yeah, but I'm... thinking about you, and I can't wait to see you again. [Kyle] Should we go youngest to oldest? - [Penny] Yeah. [laughs] - [Kyle] All right. - Once Mom gets back from the bathroom. - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Hi. [Allen] You guys ready to lose? [whispers] Oh, my God. Not possible. Nice. [jazz playing] ♪ It was only yesterday ♪ ♪ When you stole my heart away ♪ Hi. - [bartender] Hey. - Hi. - Can I bring you something to drink? - Um... Yeah, can I get a, uh... Uh, just a vodka soda. - Sure. Lemon? - Yeah. Great, thank you. [sighs] Hey. ♪ I know that this love ♪ ♪ Has come to an end ♪ ♪ Why did I have to mess up ♪ ♪ Till the end? ♪ [gasping] Okay... I gotta stop. Oh, God. I gotta stop. - Hi. - [whispers] Hi. I missed you. - Oh, yeah? - [chuckles] Mm-hm. That's nice. I had a super hot night. I wanna tell you about it. [chuckles] - Tell me about it. - [chuckles] - My pussy's on fire right now. - Oh, boy. [chuckles] Do you wanna hear about my night? Um... I don't know, do I? I think you do. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. I was in Ryan's car... and I was sitting on his lap... I was straddling him... and I was grinding on his big fat hard cock for an hour begging him to fuck me with it. He wouldn't do it. And I need you to fix it. I need you to hit all my little spots. Hurt me a little. [moans] [Andi laughs] Let me get this straight. You didn't get what you wanted with Ryan... [yells] What? You didn't get what you wanted with Ryan, so I'm like... - second best? - No, you're not second best. - You're number one. - Your "what's in front of you"? No, you're just gonna make sure it happens. - I'm not. - You're gonna hit all my little spots. - I'm not. - Yeah. - Nope. - Mm-hm. - No, I'm tired. - You're gonna flip me over and do it. No. Okay. [sighs] I don't feel like doing that with you right now. [Kyle] I mean, to be honest, it just felt like, uh, it wasn't about me. Um... I mean, I hear your point about... Yeah, we talked a lot about, when we opened the marriage, that it was als... about also stimulating... our sex life, and I think there have been times when we've told each other about experiences that we've had, that it is hot, but like... in that moment, it just felt like you were all... jazzed up... to have sex with someone else and it didn't happen that night, so then I was like his stand-in. Which... [mediator] Maybe we can... I think what we really need to talk about is Ryan. Um... How are things going with... with him? [sighs] I... So good. It's just relaxed, you know, and it's a finite situation. So I think because I know he's leaving in, like, six and a half, seven weeks... - Mm-hm. - Like, I've allowed myself the intimacy... an intimacy with him that I probably wouldn't have allowed myself. - Mm-hm. - And it feels... It feels really different... than the bullshit that I was doing before with the... with the randos. [mediator] Right. And how are you feeling about that? [Kyle] I mean, I think it's, uh... I think it's complicated. I'm... I'm happy that you're... you're happy, truly, but I think... it's reckless that... he is... married, and his wife doesn't know anything about this. He's not in an open marriage. He's in a monogamous marriage. So he's, you know, ostensibly cheating on his wife, and, uh... Well, you seem... you seem to have a problem with it. [Kyle] Well, yeah. - I just... Why are you so... - I get it. I just think if I started sleeping with someone who you were very good friends with at some point... I'm not sleeping with him. Okay. You're right. I'm sorry. Um... I think if I was engaging in... a physical and emotional relationship with someone that you... - [groans] - had... were friends with that... You don't care about Ryan. - A, that's not true. I care about Ryan. - You don't. You don't, really. - We're not as close as we used to be. - Yeah. But he's not a stranger. - Oh... - And I'm not saying there was a rule... So now there's a rule it has to be strangers? Can I finish talking for one second without you interrupting me? Yes. I'm not even talking about a rule. I'm talking about I thought that there was a level of communication that was happening, that if you... I felt a little surprised, like, a little hoodwinked that, when you told me that... uh, you had told Ryan that we were in an open relationship, I asked if there was something there, and you were like, "I don't know. I don't think so." And then, all of a sudden, this thing was happening, and I'm just saying I would have liked a... a little more... just a little more care around our mutual friendship with him and his wife and the interconnectedness of our lives. I'm so enraged right now. - Why? - Because it's... it's like, which is it? That he's married? - That he's your friend? - Can both not be true things? Why are you using your theater voice? [sighs] Okay. You're not interested in us having a real conversation. [Andi] No, I didn't cause the crack in their marriage. If that marriage was, like, killin' it, he wouldn't be, you know, texting me a thousand times a day. Cool. Be careful. That's all I'm saying. [Andi] That's the most fucking irritating thing I've ever heard. [Kyle] We really had that thing, that sort of, like... hokey thing, where, like, I feel like we knew right away that we were... we have this, like, very deep, multi-dimensional connection. And we, like, met in college and we... we fell in love hard, and... and I'm... so glad that my wife is in my life, and that we're parents, that we're partners, but I just feel like we both cut ourselves off from... a whole universe of experience. - Mm. - And, um... Um, I don't even... I'm not even talking about sex and... dating, necessarily. I feel like a kind of self... development? - Yeah. - I mean, if I can get a little hokey, - like a kind of... - Yeah. ...evolving that I wasn't doing, - like, that I had just stopped... - Yeah. ...caring in so many areas of my life, because I was taking her for granted, because it was this sort of... It's like you got used to it. - Yes. Yeah, I got used to it. - Yeah. And I... And it felt, like, arranged. Like, it felt like, because of the legality of it, and just shit like health insurance, uh, that we were... - Like we owned each other, on some level. - Yeah. You know? And, like... I don't know. I'm... I'm clearly, like... processing all this right now, but like... - No, I love it. - [both laugh] - Yeah. Fuck. Do you have a condom? - Yeah. [panting] Hey. Hey. Did you have fun? Yeah. It was fun. [Kyle] These yellow ones are all different little emoji faces. This is a little slice of pizza, on this one. - Oh, yeah. - There's a pizza one? - Yeah. Do you want it? - I didn't know there was a pizza emoji. Sure. Thanks. Ooh, multicolor. - Yeah. - I like it. - You guys are... doing so good. - We're looking good. Um... I'm going out tonight. - Oh, okay. - I have to go out tonight. We just... You'll need to book a sitter, 'cause remember, I have plans as well. - You do? - Yeah. - No. Did you tell me? - Yeah. Oh. When did you tell me? A couple of days ago. When? Uh... I don't remember the exact day, but it's in our text history. - I don't think you did, actually. - I did. It's cool. Just, uh, see if Alex or anyone is available. I don't really... Um... I don't really have time to get into that. Is there any way you could help me? - You don't have time to text Alex? - I don't have time to text Alex. Okay, well, I don't either. - I have a full day. - I... Well, I have to go to work. I'm working too. - I actually have to go to work. - I actually have to go as well. - What are you working on? - Writing a play. Okay. [scoffs] Okay. You're literally on your phone right now. Yeah, I'm literally... Woke up to 77 emails that have to be answered before I get into work where I then walk into three back-to-back meetings. Why not make sure your children are being watched tonight, then you can answer all of your emails? Because I have a real job. - Where it actually matters... - That's not helpful. - ...if I respond to an email in time. - I have a very real job. I'm not saying you don't have a real job. I respect what you are doing, - but you don't have a deadline. - When someone says, "I have a real job," - it usually means... - You don't have a deadline, sweetheart. I have a deadline. - I do have a deadline. - Every single day, there's a deadline. No, you don't have a deadline. I do. The theater gave me a deadline. I need to have a draft done by the end of... Is it today? Is it today? - In the amount of time you've taken... - In the amount of time... - ...to belittle me... - I'm not belittling you. ...and throw your weight around, you could... - I'll text Alex. - I'm not. - Texting right now. - I'm working 80 hours a week. - Look how easy this is. - If that's throwing my weight around... - Thank you so much. - Oh, wow. She's... I see the bubble. - She's responding already. - Thank you. I appreciate it. She can do it. - Great. I really appreciate it. - That was so tough. You... You just couldn't have done that because of those emails. I saw how the emails got in the way of that. - What? - What is going on with you? I don't appreciate you... being rude. I'm just sitting here, and you... you came in super activated. You're making a big deal out of nothing. No, you're making a big deal out of nothing. All I did was ask you to help me get a sitter because I have to go to work. Okay. You're gonna, like, just roll your eyes at me at breakfast. There's clearly something goin' on, so... - Oh, you're all-knowing now? - I will figure out the sitter for you. You're a real hero. I appreciate it. That's a long one, the one you're workin' on. Yeah, I'm makin' a necklace with different letters... Oh, I was gonna say, that's three times bigger than your wrist. [Penny chuckles] Yeah. Kyle, you need more coffee? - I'm good, man. Thanks. - All right. [phone vibrates] [sighs] I'm sorry for getting you involved in this... stupid... situation with my damn life... and... [sighs] Fuck. [sighs] Do you... Do you want me to just... - I'm sorry, I mean, um, I'm... - It's just... Do you want me to go? No. - Can I sit next to you? - Yeah. Yes, please. - I don't wanna stand on your hand. - It's all right. I just feel trapped. Did you feel trapped before you got here? Yeah, I think so. I mean, coming here was like a way out of something for a little bit. - Mm. - Uh... Being back here, being around you, being... like, on stage again. Like, it was like, "Oh my God, this is what I..."- Mm-hm. "...don't have out there," you know, like... And... like, "Why don't I have this anymore?" And not like it's anybody's fa... fault, but it fucking sucks. Uh... - But we're also, like, not in real life. - I... - [sighs] - This isn't your real life. Yeah. - I'm just saying... I don't wanna say... - I know. I don't wanna, like, say that this isn't real, but... this is not your... life. Yeah, I can't... - I guess my question... - You don't live here. You don't... You live in LA. You are married to someone. What if it was my real life, though? That you move back to Chicago and do plays? Yeah. And, like, not do TV anymore? Yeah. And just figure out a way to be with you. Um... I'm very... I like you a lot. I care about you. I'm into you, obviously. I just wanna remind you that I am... married. - Mm-hm. - And I have a family, and... I love... him. - Mm-hm. - And... Yeah. It's just... not so straightforward. Yeah. Yeah, I know all those things. Um... All right, like, I... I... I hear... and I'd still... am willing to... be... uh... in... uh, in a completely, like, crazy situation if it means that I can just... spend more time with you, 'cause... that's something I've wanted for a long time, and to actually be able to have it... and to be able to... say it... You know? And tell you, and, like, have you... just hear it, um... is, uh... [chuckles] [sniffles] ...is great. Oh, and I can certainly figure out a way to explain, like, that it wasn't just, like... a whim, you know, to her... [phone rings] Fuck. - Is that her? - Yep. You should... Uh, I'm gonna take this, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Hey. Where are you? [sighs] [knocking] - Hey. - Hey, what's up? Nothin'. How are you? I'm good. Good to see you. It's really good to see you. Yeah. So... what's up? Well... What do you mean? I mean, nothing's up. I just missed you. I wanted to hang out. [sighs] Sure, um, and I was really excited to... hear from you. I've missed you, too. I, uh... It's just sort of super complicated to get that text from you when I'm like... trying to give you... - space, and, like, maintain, like... - Right. strictly friend... - behavior and, uh... you know... - Right. I definitely wanted... to... have some space, and... - Mm-hm. - Um... try that out. [laughs] And I'm... I'm really glad that we did, but, uh... I don't think... I don't think that... Hm. I just want... I... I would love to... When we were in the park that day, you sort of said, like, if I wanted to hang out in the future, that we could, right? Oh, shit. Yeah. I mean, I actually... This is what I'm confused about. I... So... I came over here assuming that, uh... you still wanna keep it... strictly in the friend zone. So, like... Well... I guess I was curious to see how you felt about... [both chuckle] Um... revisiting a different version of... Oh, this... this meeting has shifted. See, I didn't see that... that negotiating tactic. Uh... - Now I see why you're behaving that way. - Yeah, I'm totally, uh... Yeah, I'm totally open to that. I mean, I think I've... always been open to that. I'm also, like... intellectually aware that, like, it's an unfair... scenario for you if you're looking to find, like, a long-term relationship. So, like, I don't know if you're... dating anyone right now, I don't know what happened with that guy... - Malcolm from the bar the other night... - I mean... I'm still dating some people a little bit, but that guy, it didn't work out with that guy, but... Really? - He's very nice, but it didn't work out. - He's very nice? Did he have a lot of homework for his high school classes? Shut up. You're one to talk. [laughs] Uh... But... [laughs] I mean, even that night before he showed up, it was like... I had such a good time with you and... even just sitting there with you that night, I just wanted to, like, kiss you. And it was sort of fun, in a way, to experiment with... - not doing that. - Sure, yeah. - I agree. - Um... But as time has worn on a little bit, I think I just... I don't think that, um... I don't think it... it's what I wanted, you know? - Okay. - [laughs] - I'm in a very different position. - Yeah. Like, I'm... uh, married, and I have kids. You are? [both chuckle] - Can I interrupt you? - Yeah, please. Would you... Can we go sit on the couch? I feel like we're... Like I should have paperwork in front of me. Sure, yeah. - Okay. - Let's move to the couch. Hey, just to reiterate, I... I really don't wanna ever get in the way of you meeting someone, though, and... and having, like, a... a real... big kind of relationship that you wanna have. Yeah. I'm not that worried about that. - Okay. - [chuckles] - Is that okay? - Yeah, of course. I really missed you. - I love you. - I love you, too. I was going on all these dates and things. - Mm-hm. - [chuckles] Yeah, me too. I just missed you. Hey, I've changed my mind. Can you pull up here on the right? I wanna get out. What the fuck? I mean... what? Can I buy you a drink? Yeah. This is crazy. How surreal. - Hey, how are you doing? - Hi, good. Um, can I get a vodka soda, please? - I gotcha. - Thank you. [sighs] I mean... this is crazy. [ice clinking] Thanks. [clears throat] Cheers. [glasses clink] [chuckles] So, how are you? I'm so... bewildered. Um... I just kind of, like, I just feel like something... lifted. I had a whole thing where I basically ruined... Ryan's marriage... uh... for no good reason. Uh... His... Sadie found a picture. - Oh, shit. - And... But what was... For me, what was most sort of... Do you... Do you care? Do you wanna know this? Are you kidding me? I just... uh... - Nothing I'd rather hear about. - I'm so freaked out. What really... I... I was really... I was very into him. - I... Yeah, I know. - And, uh... And... and then I... It, uh... it, like, lifted. Why? I... I just... I saw him. You know? I had... I had created this... - character in my mind... - Mm. and it was like some version of him that I had decided he was when he was gone in LA, and... I sort of combined him with my... the person that I knew when I was 20, and... decided he was... super fascinating, and, um... you know, cared about me, and... and I think he really does, - and in fact, really, really does. - Sure he does. Yeah. And then something... it just sort of... In... in dismantling of his... his marriage, his whole sort of... personhood fell apart. - Mm. - And I... It... it sort of, like... Like, the... the... whatever... whatever fog of... Just... It's so embarrassing. It just lifted and I'm... Now I'm, like, mortified, and I am not... There's a reason why I didn't end up with Ryan, you know? God, I'm... so sorry, that's a lot. - Yeah. - That must... That must be really painful. I mean, it's painful in that it's disappointing, but it's not that painful... for me. I mean, it's... [Kyle sighs] It's depressing. Yeah. It just felt shitty. I had no idea. I'm sorry. I don't like that you had no idea. I don't like that you're saying sorry like you're my friend. - I am your friend. - I appreciate you saying you're sorry, - but, like, that makes me feel sad. - Why? Because it feels like I'm talking to a friend who's, like, "Oh, I'm sorry." Um... I... I mean, I don't know how else to respond. I'm here for you, and I love you, and that sounds terrible and complicated, and... painful for you. So, I'm sorry that you're experiencing... - distress. - I know. Thank you. I just... And I'm... Thank you. And as your friend and... and as someone who loves you, thank you, but I don't feel you. - [sighs] - I don't like this. - What is this... - I don't feel you! - What do you mean? - I don't... I don't know. I just... I don't like this. Being in an open relationship? - Yeah. - Um... Okay. I... I sort of don't know how to respond. I mean, uh... That's a... That's... That's a big thing to take in. I mean, I, uh... I think I'm gonna need... a minute to sort of process that. I... I do like it. Or... Uh... I don't know if "like" is the right word, but I'm... I'm invested in it. And I'm interested in it, and I feel... challenged by it in a good, interesting way. And I don't know that I can walk it back at this point. Do you... Do you want me? Yes. - Do you? - Absolutely. What does that mean to you? - What do you mean? - What's the point? What does it mean to you? I mean, I... The point is that we have committed to each other and we have children, and we have a life that we have built together, and I'm... I don't... You don't have to do that, though. You don't have to be committed. You don't... You don't have to do that. Oh, I actually know, for the first time, that I don't have to do that. And this past year and change is the first time that I think... in a long time that I am consciously choosing to be with you. Like, I'm more awake now to the idea that I don't... That I'm not stuck with you or bound to you or shackled to you. Like, I'm now knowing that, like... every day, I'm choosing to... partner with you, - and... and live a life together. - But why? For what? You... It's great, like, it's great? I don't feel close to you. - I'm sorry. I don't. - Yeah, I haven't felt close to you either. So why, then? What... what are you getting out of this? I mean, it's great, 'cause you have, like, a mom and someone who, like... who gives a shit and takes care of you, but, like, you get to go and do all these fun things and go to your whatever things, - and see your girlfriends and whatever... - It hasn't been that fun for me. - ...your Tinder dates. - But it's... I think you're not... It's... This isn't fun. It's been incredibly messy and challenging, and destabilizing and upsetting. I mean, I... I had my heart broken recently. It's been so long since I've felt that... and it... shook me up. I feel... insecure and judged and... ugly and fat and old and... unattractive and completely... uncool and ill-equipped to be, like... throwing myself out there, but I keep doing it because I was dead. I mean, we were... we were stuck. And now I feel like we're not stuck. And I don't know what I'm doing, but I feel like I'm actually engaging with the world again. But you're not engaging with me. You don't want me. [sighs] I do want you, and I hear that, but I think we're not engaging with each other. I don't think this is about... No, we're not. We're not engaging with each other. But I just don't... I don't feel like... You don't want me. You don't want me. - Andi, you need to trust... - It feels... - It feels like you don't want me. - Don't tell me what I want. If this is gonna work, we gotta... Like, if I'm saying I want you, you have to trust that. Do I always want you in the same way? No. Like, I think spending a life with someone is about... riding the wave of ups and downs and, like, I'm aware that... Yeah, but you're not talking about the thing that I'm talking about. - What are you talking about? - That you're... That you're... Like, I don't wanna actually go do this shit with other guys. - I don't want to. I don't... I don't... - Okay. Okay! I wanted to have sex... and we weren't having sex, and I wanted... I wanted that. Yeah, me too. And now that's happening. Yeah, and now I just feel like... Why? For what? - I... I mean... - Is that really what it is? - I... - You need, you have to fuck other people? You know that that's not... I'm... I'm genuinely asking. What is it, then? No, I mean it's not about... I think... you're the one... who... this has been more about, like, when you say, like, "I just wanted to have sex." Well, I wanted to feel sexy, - and I wanted to feel paid attention to. - Right, but I'm actually... I'm like... in a relationship with someone. - Like... - You mean... Amy. Like, we... We're figuring it out. We... We... sort of re... considered being together tonight. We reconciled. We are... reengaging with each other. And I don't know what that'll be. I mean, I... It... Yeah, I... I might be playing with fire. It's, like, it has... sort of, eventually, an expiration date, because she wants to be married and have kids, and... and I can't give that to her. So I know that she might meet someone, but... I don't wanna shut myself off to... continuing to know her. Okay. Okay. Look, I hear, I see that this is really hard for you. Do you love her? Yeah. What is the point? Why are you talking... Why are you here? Why are you doing this? Why? It sucks. Fucking sucks. It sucks for me. For me, it sucks. Do you understand? - Now... Now I do. I... - It sucks! - I'm so sorry. I... - How would you feel? What do you mean? I mean, like, you've been obsessed with Ryan for weeks now. - I feel... - That's exactly right. I've been obsessed. - And so stupid. - Uh... I guess I just don't know what you thought we were doing. - I don't know what we're doing. - I feel a little, like... uh, tricked right now. - Like, we've been... - I'm sorry, I don't mean to... You've known about Amy from the beginning. Like, we've... I... I think what's happening here is, like, we ha... we lost each other in this. We have not been... You haven't told me any of this. You haven't shared any of this with me. Obviously I've known something was going on, because you've been really sharp with me, and I'm sure I have been with you. But... And I get it. - It's horrible to hear that... - I'm not even mad at you. I'm not mad at all. I'm just so sad. You can't get it back. Can you? How do you get it back? This is so stupid. I feel so stupid. I don't know. I don't wanna do it. You can be in love with her. [sniffles] Obviously, I can't stop you. But I don't think you'll get closer to me - by being in love with her. - I... - By being with her. - I don't think this is something that we can decide in a bar. - You don't have to decide anything. - Like, I think that I deserve more... of a continuing... conversation and process about this. I think maybe - we can talk about it in couples' therapy. - What am I getting? I don't know. You need to tell me what you're getting. But I also know you weren't getting anything out of our marriage - a year and a half ago. - Yeah, yeah, you're right. So I don't know what you wanna go back to, Andi. I don't know what was so thrilling - and compelling for you before. - Right. I don't know. I think it was... compelling to love someone and be loved. I think that's pretty compelling, you know? I know this is stupid and I'm sorry, but it's just sad. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to take anything away from you. I just feel so sad. We don't have to do anything. It's fine. You can be with her. - I just don't wanna do it. - All right. And... And I hear that. I hear what you're saying. I'm asking you to also hear me and meet me halfway, in that... I think right now you're... you're making this a little black and white. I don't know what will happen with her. I don't... I... I love her. I have love for her. She is... has become a very special person to me. It's also very possible that tomorrow, she will freak out again and say, "I don't wanna do this." It's not really about what she's gonna do, for me. I don't really care what she's gonna do. I feel sorry for her. I'm sad for her, too. I just think there's a real possibility that you're gonna change your mind... in a couple of days, and realize that... [Andi sighs] I don't know what to say. I mean, I... I don't see right now how I can walk this decision back, I mean, I feel like... I have opened up a whole... Pandora's Box that, like, I'm not... I'm committed to this more than just, like, having sex with people. Like, it's actually, like, a... It feels like an intrinsic... shift inside of, like, who I am and how I view the world, and how I feel like... uh... I like myself better now. I like... our life better now. I feel better about myself. I feel more in my... self than I ever did. And I don't believe that it's healthy... for us or anyone to... lock into this... you know, "I own you and you own me and you can't think about anybody else." And, I mean... I'm not saying that we have to always have sex with other people or relationships with other people, but, like, I think... the open, the con... uh... Having the conversation, to me, makes me feel like it's not taboo, and it's not... And that I'm not perverted, and that, like, I can... That I'm not trapped. I don't wanna trap you. I'd like to continue figuring out... being together side-by-side, raising our children, and... growing up as people together, and... But, like, if you're not interested in that, then we can start talking about what that looks like, but I'm not... Um... I'm not interested in making some snap decision tonight, or any night soon, about... - I'm just lonely. - Yeah. I mean, I'm not just lonely. I'm lonely. I get it. This isn't... This isn't good. I don't have to make any snap decisions. I'm just saying it isn't good. And it sounds like it's really good for you. No, That's... I mean, like... No, you just... you just said all the ways in which it's good for you, and I'm... I'm really happy. And I know I don't look happy, but I'm happy for you and I mean that. I can't deny that. [whispers] Yeah. I think... you're romanticizing... this whole... thing. Uh... - Okay. - And I say that as a friend. I don't... I'm not saying that, like, you're a dumb fuck. I'm saying I think you're romanticizing... That you're having a romance with your... your idea of this, and it's 'cause it's feeling really good and you're in love with someone. I mean... I've never been with... in love with anyone else. The only person I've ever been in love with was you. Can we just go? I don't... I don't feel like crying anymore. I'm sick of it. [sighs] Yeah. Let me pay for these drinks. [sighs] I do love you. I love you, too. So much. Can you just think about me... for tonight? And will you not look at your phone? Yeah. Absolutely.
