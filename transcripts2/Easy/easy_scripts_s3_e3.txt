 [woman] We're committed to building - what's next for Chicago. - [cheering] That we don't just talk about the issues and the problems. We have the ideas, the energy... Okay, we have this... sort of swelling, inspiring speech that she's giving, and it's like, "Who is this woman? Where is she speaking? Who is she talking to?" And then, we see her moving from all of these rallies, all these town halls, in public, fielding questions. And then I wanna drop it out,

 and have it be silent. Just her in her office working, so that we all have a minute to take a collective breath and realize how intense this is. And then, we'll get it to the interview footage of her explaining who she is, why she's doing this, and the audience really gets to know her when they already feel for what she's doing. Yeah, I love that. - Okay. - Great. We have hours and hours of footage. Even if you can isolate, like, the best 10 to 15 minutes, and then we make two or three versions of two and a half minute openings, - Yeah. - ...we can figure out what works best,

 and kind of plug and play from there. Okay, sweet. Amazing. Ladies, hi! Let's get comfortable, let's get the discussion started. Have a seat. Welcome to the coochie conference. - Thank you so much for coming. - [woman 1] Thank you guys for coming. We really appreciate it. - [clattering] - Uh-oh. - [woman 2] Uh-oh. - That's me. This month, we're gonna be talking about redefining our relationships. Um, I think for me, personally, I've been going through this really weird stage where I've been, like, cutting a lot of people off. Well, to be honest, I'm, like, the cut-off queen, right? Like, that's my go-to whenever there's conflict, whenever I don't like something, I'm like, "You're outta my life." I think that being able to exist on a spectrum, the same way that sexuality or preferences can exist, can only make a relationship stronger, 'cause you're able to be as in it or as out of it as you want to be. You can only be let down if your expectation isn't agreed to, you know, if you're always looking for that same thing, you might be let down. How do you figure out where to set your boundaries then, if you... To me, like, the expectations and the projection, like, - that's a really fine line. - Just being able to find a common ground and being willing to listen and learn that person, because it's not always comfortable. and we have to realize that, like, I dunno, people aren't always brought up the same way you are so you sometimes have to get out of your comfort zone. You know, once you got into a relationship, just letting the relationship dictate the expectation. If you're spending all this time with someone, I think you can expect more of them, you can expect that quality time. You can expect them showing up, that accountability, and not having, like, a label have to dictate how much expectation you have. You just want experiences with people. 'Cause we put labels on things. So we have, like, platonic, romantic, family, friends, and this is how friends act, and this is how family is, and you have different sets of rules and expectations, depending on what category those people fall into. But if you're just experiencing people... considering the fact that sometimes people that are your blood are shit... [chuckles] ...and people that are your friends sometimes become family, so you have these different bonds and ties and experiences. I'll see you when I get home? Are you sure you don't wanna come home with me and cuddle? - I do. - We haven't done that in forever. What? Okay. We'll cuddle when I get home. I never see them, so I'm gonna have a drink or two, and then I'll come home and we'll cuddle. - Okay. - Okay. - Love you. - Love you. - Be safe. - Text me when you get home. Oh, um... I ran into our landlord, Seamus. He wants to make sure we're renewing the lease. Okay. When do we have to let him know by? Uh... I don't know. What? Is there a chance we're not renewing the lease? No, I mean, I just wanna... know when we have to let him know by. So we can look at it and see what we want to do. - [woman] We're heading out. - Okay. See you in a sec. Um... I... I don't... Don't... Whoa. What? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay? - Take care. Yeah. I'm just asking questions. I'm just distracted, 'cause I don't want them to leave me. - I love you. - Love you. I'll see you when I get home. We'll talk about it, okay? - Okay. - You okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Love you. - Love you, too. - Bye. Hi. Hi. How was it? Uh... Good. I know we were gonna try to avoid this, but I need you to be straight up with me right now, 'cause you're obviously feeling some shit, and I can feel it, and I just need you to be 100 percent honest. Oh... I... I don't know. I just wanna... try... other things and have more experiences before I just... end up in a relationship forever... having all these curiosities, like, on my mind. We're young. I think it's just a conversation that... we should be having before we just sign another lease and don't consider all the things we don't know about ourselves yet. Don't you think about what you might want? You don't know what you want yet... [scoffs] I don't know... who I'm going... to be in... you know, five years. I wanna, like, get closer to figuring that out before... Okay. Um... I guess this means we're not re-signing the lease. Hey, Reuben. - Hey, Bing. - Yo. What are you doing here? Just trying to pass this QC. Still have a couple dead pixels. That's a no. - That sucks. - Yeah. - It's good to see you, though. - Good to see you, too. - [woman] ...push... - Hey. - We're changing the status quo... - Hi. ...at every level in the city of Chicago, - and that's why we're here. - [woman] That's right! - [stops video] - [sighs] You okay? Well... I think I went through a breakup last night. So, that's a bummer. - Shit. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. Really did not see that one coming. Oh. I... I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. Um... I... want to... be here for you and talk to you about this. I hate having to say that we have a big deadline. Can you put a Band-Aid on this - for the next eight hours? - Yeah. And we can complete these sequences and get that sound mixed? And then I will take you out tonight and buy you all the drinks. - And we will talk about all the things. - Absolutely. - That sounds awesome. - Are you sure? Yes. This will be a welcome distraction. - Okay, you sure? - Yeah, let's do it. Thank you. I'm sorry. Okay. Um... When we get into... - Hey. - Hi. [Chase] How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Good. I will only be here for a little bit. - Of course. - I really appreciate this. - Dude, don't even worry about it. - [Chase] I know this is annoying. No, as long as you need. - Thank you. - Can I get you anything? Do you want, like, a water or something? - I will take water. Thank you. - Okay. - Does she hate that I'm here? - She does not hate it. She does not hate it. She's totally okay with it. We talked about it. It's fine. - Yeah. - Our couch is not occupied. - I mean, just... - We love you. [scoffs] - You know. You know, man. - [chuckles] - Won't be long. - Yeah, as long as you need. - Like a week or two, or something. - Yeah. There's always the possibility of you guys coming back together stronger, - but you have to take this space first. - Mm. Mm. You can't be that strong without being that true. - That's right. - Yeah. I keep thinking about coming back weaker. I'm gonna come back stronger. No, absolutely you're gonna come back stronger. - Yeah. - It just turned out to be... that, you know, I'm an independent woman. I like you flipping your no hair. - That's nice. - Check it. - Yeah. - [both laugh] Thanks. She acts on such impulse, which I love. Like, I love spontaneity, but I'm scared that our relationship will end, and she'll be out of my life forever, but I'm also scared that, if we stay together, that she's put this, like, schism in a great thing, and will I ever be able to get... back to where we were? But you have to know that that isn't about you. And I know that that also really sucks, it feels like the most personal thing in the world when a person who you love says, "I need something else." But that is about her. That is about her needs. It's like when a person says, "I need to spend time alone." They're not saying, "I need to spend time away from you." They're saying, "Me, myself and I need this time." - And... - Yeah. I know that's sort of the minutia, and we're splitting hairs here, but it really is an important distinction. And her needs... are not about you, and something you are not or something you are not doing. You are smart, and fucking bright, and exceptional, and you're talented, and like... And funny, and gorgeous... Funny and stunning, and you have a great laugh. You just want me to, like, keep... Please. I need a confidence boost. - Right. Um, cool, so... - [laughs] I'm hanging out with the black kids, "Yo, get your African ass outta here." And I hang out with the African kids, they're like, "Please, remove your American ass from the premises. Thank you, boss. Go home." And then I hang out with the white kids, and the white kids are like, "Hey, get your black ass... over here, my nigga, let's hang out!" - Hey, Allie! - Hey. - Hi. - Look at you! - [Allie] This is Kat. - Nice to meet you. - What is that? - My mistress. No, no, no. It's an old Polaroid. Here, actually, I'll get you guys right here. Okay, ready? There we go. Okay. Yo, we're about to bring this shit. This next act coming onstage, he's opened for everybody. Fucking Goldie, to Talib Kweli, to Chuck D, man. I need you to make some fucking noise now, please. - Make some goddamn noise. - [cheering] He's single-handedly bringing dark-skinned niggas back in style. Please give it up for Ric Wilson!

This is an instant, this is not an app. - [Chase] Oh, okay. All right. - Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Nope. [Kat] I'm still taking a picture. Don't move. - Don't move. - [giggles] [laughing] Mm-hm. - This is a good move. - Thank you. - I get why you use this thing. - Mm-hm. - Ooh! - This is Coltrane. Just... [Chase] Seems you didn't know I haven't had anybody to t alk to. - Mm-mm. Oh, yeah! - No? "Look at this!" Yeah. Yeah. [woman] The goal for me is not to just hold office. There is things to do, and the Mayor's Office is a vehicle to get some things done. Because the things that need to be changed... You have the chance to actually determine the direction of this city for the next couple of generations. [turns tape off] This is so good. - Really? - Yes. - Holy shit. - You nailed it! [Jo] Oh, my God. Thank God. I am just... I am shook. I'm... I'm emotional watching this. Oh, my gosh. Wow, I am so relieved. - Thank you. - I was so nervous. I'm so happy about that, because I brought you a cupcake. Um, so it would have been very awkward if you hated my edit. [laughs] [whispering] You went to Smallcakes? - I went to Smallcakes. - You brought me a treat? Do you know what kind? Don't say it. - Carrot cake, baby. - [gasps] She listens and she edits like a motherfucker! I'm serious. This made me emotional. Like, watching this is... it's like you were in my head. I'm so happy. That's awesome. Thank you. Yeah. I'm really relieved. I was so nervous. Oh, my God. This smells so good. All I did was make us coffee, and it's black, so... Oh, my gosh, thank you so much. Black office coffee. So considerate of you. - Yeah, it's, you know, my love language. - [Jo laughs] - Um... Do you wanna split this with me? - Absolutely. I half got it for me, so... - Perfect. - Mm-hm. [Chase] What time is it? I need to know the time. It's very bright. Let me see. Wow, okay. I... need to order a car. - Order a car? - Yeah. You about to go? Yeah, I need to go home. - Oh. - It's later than I thought it was. - Okay. - Okay, um... Can you put in your address? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. Um... I had fun. Hm. I'm sorry. I, like, left my stuff out everywhere. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. [woman] Uh, can I... can I talk to you? Yeah. Um, I was just wondering if you have, like, an exit strategy... or something, just 'cause... just 'cause you were gonna be here for a week or two. It's been like, a month. Yeah, um... no... I... Yes. [chuckles] I was just telling Amber how I was, um... My next place, I'm gonna get the keys and figure out... get all my stuff there. - Okay, cool. - I was just moving things. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't have to be, like, right away, just... - I need the space for the weekend. - No, I'm gonna get out. - My boyfriend's coming from out of town. - Yeah. So, as long as... - you could, like, clear out by then. - [Chase] Yeah. No, all of this will be gone. I will be gone. You and your boyfriend are gonna have a good time in your apartment without me... everywhere, all my stuff everywhere and everything. Um... This is good timing. - I was gonna get out of your hair anyways. - Yeah. - No problem. - Thank you so much. - Okay. All right. - Oh! Thank you. - Thank you. - Um... - Yeah. - Yeah, I'll... I'll see you. Yeah! Have fun with your boyfriend. - Thank you, bye. - Yeah, bye. [children screaming and playing] [Jo] Hey. - Hi. - Need help? Thanks... - Yeah. - For...um... letting me... stay here for a little bit, I, um... This is awkward, but I... It will just be temporary. No, it's fine. I got you set up here on the couch. Um... It looks different in here. Yeah, I packed all of our stuff up. You... Half are your boxes, half are mine, and then there's stuff... I didn't really know what to do with it, so if you could take a look and take what you want, and then I will pack up the rest. Okay. How's it been? How are you? How are you? Good. All right, well, I'm gonna go hang out with some friends tonight, so... I guess I'll see you when I get home. Okay. [door closes] So... we did it. Yeah, we did. - I think it was really good. - Yeah. Thank you for all the help. I could not have done this without you. - Oh, my God, thank you for teaching me. - I mean that. Mm... Your instincts are better than you think they are. - Thanks. - Yeah. [sighs] It's gonna be weird not to see you every day. I know. I was just thinking that. - It's kind of sad. - Yeah. Who am I going to talk to about... the news and the dumpster fire that is the planet? - [laughs loudly] - And have snacks with? [Jo] I don't know. Who to commiserate with? Mm. Well... I suppose the one plus of us not having the budget to keep you on here full-time is that I'm no longer technically your boss, and I can finally ask you if you'd like to... talk about less depressing things, uh, over dinner sometime. I would love that. Me, too. Okay. - Let me know when and where, I'm there. - All right. I'll wrap up with these guys, and I'll shoot you a text. - Okay. - Okay. - Great. - Thank you. - Bye. - It's been great. [Alexandra] More to come. Please. Where are you going? Uh... Going on a date. [scoffs] Okay. Um... Do you mind... going through this stuff? It's been a couple days. You haven't, and it's kind of giving me anxiety. Yeah. Tonight? - Yes. - Thank you. You're welcome. [scoffs] Have fun on your date. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. Don't act like you didn't ask for this. It's exactly what I asked for. - Love it. - Bye. This is great. - [woman] Hi. - Hey. - How are you doing? - Good. How are you? Good, thanks. Um... I think there might be a reservation under "Alexandra"? - Hey. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. How are you? You look fantastic. [hostess] Would you ladies like a table or would you like to sit at the bar? I always like to sit at the bar, but whatever you like. Let's go to the bar. - Okay. - [hostess] Great, you can follow me. Cheers. I'm glad we did this. Me, too. I'm happy you asked me out. I was definitely a little nervous. - Really? - Yeah. Why? Because... we've been working together, and you're a fantastic editor and... I didn't want to... screw it up. - I don't know. - Yeah. I thought I was being totally obvious about having such a crush on you... - What? No. - For so long. - Really? - No. I, um... I just... clearly think you are fantastic, and I was trying not to be, like... your... creepy, uh, boss checking you out at work. It's the first thing I think when I look at you. Just creepy. - Great. - You're so creepy. - I'm glad I come off as my true self. - Yes. Yeah, of course. No, please, be as creepy as you want. It is more than welcome. Okay. - All right, then. - That's great news. [Alexandra] So... do you want dessert? Do you want another drink? I'm sure this place has excellent dessert, but I would, honestly... maybe like a nightcap? Okay. Do you wanna do that here? Do you wanna move to another bar? I honestly would take you to my apartment, but my ex-girlfriend is on the couch. Right. - Oof. - [both laugh] - I know. - Okay, well... if you want to have another drink, not at a bar... we could go to my place. I do not have anyone on my couch. But no rush, obviously. No pressure. I think that's a great idea. [toilet flushes] Sorry. - [Alexandra] I don't know. Our... - [laughing] Stupid, but funny. Well, welcome. - This is amazing. - Mm. - Thank you. - Yeah. I love it. It's weird working with somebody for so long, and not knowing where they live. Mm. Well... this is it. Do you want another tequila? I would love one. Okay. [both chuckle] - A novice... - You okay there? [whispers] Yeah. [whispers] I have been thinking about that for weeks. [both chuckle] [phone vibrates] [phone vibrates] [phone vibrates] - I have to go turn that off. - Okay. [moaning] Can we stop for two seconds? What? Yeah, yeah. [sighs] - Are you okay? - Sorry, yeah. - Yeah. - No, don't be sorry. I just... I got, um... I just turned off my phone and I got a lot of just paragraphs of text messages. I don't know what they are, and... Um... It's okay. What... What do you need? I can, like, either stop and read them... It's just a lot of paragraphs, - and I don't know if it's good or bad... - It's lot of content. - A lot of content, and... - Right. ...my mind is just elsewhere. [chuckles] Yeah. I... [sighs] ...love your boobs. [both laugh] I like you. Um... No pressure on... on my end. - God. - [laughs] You are so cool. Don't say things like that. I'm gonna fall in love with you. I'm so sorry. Ugh... Don't be sorry. Don't be sorry. I wish I didn't have this shit going on. But when we do... do this, I want it to be, like, just us. Right now it feels like there's a third person in the room. Yeah, I know. But that doesn't feel like a place to start. That's like a place you get eventually if both parties agree. [Jo laughs] [door opening] [man on TV] ...to my restaurant... ...loves your technique... Definitely very respectful. That first contact. If this is the steak for me, and I look at it, and I say... - [sighs] - "Well, I've left it here for nine days." I put it there, leave it there for six minutes. And then turn it... But what happens is that I put it in a certain pot, and turn to make it done... [keys rattling] [can opens] You can see crust there. And we'll be able to... [footsteps] [drink pours] Over the years, I've created, working with you... I know you very well. I know what the things are. We are a team that... flows, constantly. ♪ I just wanna lay here ♪ ♪ Smoke my cig and drink my wine And think ♪ ♪ I wanna lay here ♪ ♪ Until my hurting's done ♪ ♪ I just wanna lay here ♪ ♪ Smoke my cig and drink my wine And think ♪ ♪ I wanna lay here ♪ ♪ Until my hurting's done ♪ ♪ Confío fácilmente en la gente ♪ ♪ Y por eso ya no tengo nada ♪ ♪ Pararme fuerte, estoy cansada ♪ ♪ Y mis huesos se sienten viejos ♪ ♪ Creerme ya no tengo nada ♪ ♪ Porque todo te lo dejo y yo... ♪ ♪ Asi pasando y con mis dudas fumo más ♪ ♪ Sigo cantando Como que se que otra vez el sol ♪
