 [Annie] Let's try it again on the count of three. One, two, three. To the G7, yeah. Back to C. Great. Looking good, you got it. [man] Ridiculous. Dying! - [man 2] Dead. - [woman laughing] This floret will bring you back to life. - That floret's too big for me. - [laughing] - I got a tiny one right here. - See, that is...

 - That's my ideal. - Aww. That is... - A little baby floret. - Ready? - I didn't wanna say it right away. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Annie. - Hi, Annie. How's it goin'? - Good. How are you? - Just choking on a floret. - Oh, careful. - Well... Annie, you wanna come get a drink with us after work? - Mm. - Yeah. - I would, but I have Abby, so... - Aww. - Thanks for the invite, though. - Yeah. You know, I... I feel like I'm always missing out. Always so busy. ...We'll get you out one night. - Yeah. Okay.

 [Annie] Wow, you look great. - Is it too much? - No, I love it. It's such a cool dress. I know. I really like it. But is it, like, "I'm trying really hard" or is it okay? No, I... I think it's good. Yeah, do you like this guy? I mean... I don't know. He asked me out. It's like... My choices are to stay here and put this little pumpkin to bed and then, like, feel so lonely, or I can go and have dinner and just, like, have a drink and try and be like... - in the world. - You've been inspiring me. 'Cause, like, I... I... You know, I've been, just like... such a nun. [both laugh] You have not been swiping right. - No! Yeah, no. - Or whatever way you swipe. I've just, like, been, like, just waiting for, like, a husband to knock on the door, like, "Hey, I'm your husband." - Yeah. - I gotta... I gotta go out there more. I... I don't know that anyone should follow my lead. I'm, like, a sad, divorced, single mom, but, like... I don't know, I'm just trying to say yes and be open and, like, give people a chance - and have human interactions and, like... - Yeah. ...also eat a good dinner, and not grapes and avocados, right? You do get a meal out of it. - I mean, like, what are our other options? - Right. We could be totally alone... - Yeah. - ...or we can try. Right, pumpkin? - Yeah. - You gonna have a fun night? - Are we hangin'? - Yeah. - Okay. I love you. - You know what... - I love you, too. - Aww. [kissing] You have the same hair as me. We have the same hair. Did we plan it that way? - [Abby] Yeah! - Maybe we've been hanging out too much. - Have so much fun. - Bye. - Okay, good luck. - [Abby] Hey. "Soft is the moonlight, soft is my bed. Soft is the kiss on my sleepy head." Mwah! [Annie] I'm going to say yes to everyone who asks me out for the next 30 days. Okay, I like it. Yeah, right? So how does that work exactly? I don't know. I guess I just... I will... Whoever I connect with, like, on my phone, like on an app or something, or, like, if I'm just, like, walkin' down the street and somebody asks me out... Like... Like, when does that happen? But... [laughs] - Follow up. - Hm. What if... you know... immediately that you are not physically attracted to someone? I still have to go. I have to say yes. - Okay. - Yeah. - I like it. - Because what if that person ends up being the person that I get married to? [man] Your family recipe, where is it from? Where did it start... I guess maybe Naples or somewhere in, like, southern Italy? It comes from my mom's side. So, I don't really eat a lot of meat, but I just like to have, like, a meatball, - You know. - Yeah. - So good. - Yeah. - ...just trying to be open and... - What are you lookin' for? Um... Well, uh... [laughs] - Private security solutions. - Oh. Intelligence gathering... Uh, general surveillance. - I'm a deep guy. - Yeah, I... I'm sensing that. [chuckles] - To a night of bad dates. - Cheers. I normally don't, uh, go on dates with women. This is my first, actually. - Just wanted to get that out there, so... - Cool. I mean, I... I should say I don't do it a lot. You know, I'm into people... Funny enough, the best date was a girl. We had a really fun time. We danced, and she kind of, like, really took charge. And I was just like, "Okay." - Billy Joel's like me, so... - Ah, Billy Joel. - Did you ever see him live? - When I... Yeah, I won tickets when I was, like, in high school, on the radio. - I won two tickets to see him. - What? It was amazing. I took my dad. It was the best. When I was 18, I won, uh, tickets, on the radio, to see him. - It was, like, really cool. - Oh, cool. [man moaning loudly] Hey, I'm sorry if you... - heard... heard us last night. [laughs] - What's that? - Oh, yeah. I did. - Sorry about that. [imitates moaning] Yeah, I remember. I was wide awake at that point. Do you want kids, or... Uh, yeah, I would love to... love to have kids. - Really? - Yeah, mm-hm. Totally. I'm... I'm 38, so it's like... I gotta figure this out pretty soon, you know. Yeah. Yeah, I'm, uh... kind of in the same boat. - Um... - Really? - Do you wanna get married? - Uh... Oh, wow. That is so weird. Like, no one's ever, like, just asked me that, like... Even... - You're joking, but it felt so strange. - I just wanted to get some practice. I went home with this guy last week. We actually... We were gonna have sex, I thought, until I saw his bed. - And he had a lot of stuffed animals. - Oh, no. I'm gonna throw up. I'm so sorry. - I'm so... - Here, here, here. Just do it in the box. I threw up in a... in a shoe box, and then I passed out. But I warned him. I mean, it was... [sighs] - It was horrible. No! - I'm sorry. - Nobody's judging you. Don't worry. - [gags] Yeah, I... I, uh... peed myself in college one time, - with the girl I thought I loved, so... - Oh. [groans] This isn't... I'm so sorry. Again. Here we go. Let's try one more time. - Hey. - Hey, Lucas. - You look great. - Oh! Thank you. - I really like your skirt. - Thanks so much. [laughs] It's like a video game. It is, but it's kind of funny that way too. Like, you could win. - Yeah, you could win. - [laughing] Really feeling that drink. [both laugh] [soft moaning] That was really nice. - Yeah. - [chuckles] So, uh... Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow? That'd be great. [sighs] - He said he was gonna call. - [laughs] His word... Yeah. [sighs] I'm sorry. Just... ghosted. Toasted. They're... They're kind of the same, yeah. You have grapes? - Hey. Good to see you. - How's it going? - Abby, look who's here. - Oh, there she is. Ready to go home? ♪ But, baby, you can't count on much ♪ ♪ With every touch so out of touch ♪ ♪ I root for you, love ♪ Don't worry about that, Annie. I can clean that up. Oh, no. I got it. Pretty much done. - Thank you for tonight. - Oh, yeah. No, no problem. - She's asleep? - Yes, finally. There was... There was a lot of back and forth. - She's such a good kid, though. - I know. How's it goin' with the new guy? I don't know. I was, like, with one dude that knew my body before babies and pregnant and after baby, and now it's like I have to share that with someone else and... - Yeah. - How's your experiment going? - It's going. - Yeah. - It's like... Oh, my gosh. - You've been in it. I am having, like, true dating fatigue. But I'm, like, sticking to it... - Yeah. - Which, you know, it's sort of... what I do, I can't... Once I set my mind to something, like... I'm gonna follow it through, but oh, my gosh, - I'm so ready for this month to be over. - [both laugh] Tomorrow, I have this date with this guy. I would never go on this date, like, otherwise. - Really? - No, but I... Like, he's so not my kind of... Like, just the vibe... Like... I... - Yeah. Yeah. - It's gonna be a disaster. [man] I think an artist knows when an artist meets another artist and I could, like, almost smell it on you and your spirit, and I know that... that you're... gonna be a great inspiration to me, so... - Oh. - I'm really looking forward to all the things that we can do. - You... You do music? - Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, I didn't tell you? - Uh... No. - Oh, yeah! Well, I'm... I mean, I'm self-taught. I was never, like, - formally trained or anything, but... - I... I just have to be honest. Um... Um... I'm not that interested. I, uh... I think I probably have to be single for a while. I'm getting over a thing. Uh. Have you ever heard that, um... that phrase, "The best way to get over one man is to get under another"? It's, like... It's, like, conventional wisdom. I... I didn't say it, but, like, I heard it. I heard it from... maybe on a T-shirt. I don't know, but... [indicator ticking] - Hey, Annie. - Hey, Lucas. Hey, do you have a second? - Yeah, what's up? - I wanted to ask you somethin'. Um... I don't know what your... situation is like these days, but I wanted to know if I could maybe... take you out for a drink some night. Oh. Uh... - I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have... - No. It... - That was inappropriate. We work together. - It's not. Uh, you're so sweet. - I just, um... - Never mind. - I... - No. I... I'm just in a weird... - weird place at the moment. - Sure. I totally get it. Okay. [laughs] - All right, okay. - I'm sorry that I... Um... Thank you. - I'll see you later. - Okay. See ya. [playing exercises] Hey. You okay? Yeah. - Good, thanks. - Okay. [band playing] ♪ The rebels that you dared ♪ ♪ Guide your feelings ♪ ♪ I'm freaking out, 'cause I never knew ♪ ♪ I fell in love with someone... ♪ Yes! That was awesome, you guys. I love that riff. I love what you're playin'. I love what you're playin'. I love those drums. All right, get on out of here, you dudes. And, uh... Hey, bring me those lyrics next time. - I wanna see what you wrote down. - I'll print them out tonight. Do it! All right. See you guys, great work. Keep it up, all right? - Thank you. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. [laughs] - What did you think about that? - They're incredible. - They're so good. - They're my dudes. - My new favorite band. - Yeah, mine too. I uh... I just wanna say I'm sorry - about earlier. - No, no. No, no, no. don't be silly. You don't have to apologize. I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have sprung that on you like that at work. - That's inappropriate. - No, no, honestly, I just... the thought of planning a date and then waiting to go on that date and just... - I can't really do that right now. - Yeah. I hear you. I totally understand that. Uh... But, uh... You know, I'm free right now if maybe you'd wanna grab a drink or something. Really? Like, right now? Yeah. I don't know. We could just go hit up a bar or something. Wait, you're not just doing this because you, like, feel bad or something, right? No, I... I'd really like to. - Yeah. - Okay. Well, I'd like to, too. - Okay. [laughs] - Um... - Cool. - Let me just break some of this stuff down and I'll meet you out front in a few minutes? - Does that work? - Sounds good. All right. I'm gonna be, uh... - rockin' out to those songs. - Yeah. They're good songs. [Annie starts singing] - [both laugh] - Weow! - See you in a sec. - Okay, I'll see you out there. - You wanna sit at the bar over there? - Sure, that's great. So, yeah, so, uh... the last frog I ordered, uh... was 25 years ago, and it's still alive, and it lives in my parents' basement. Is that an abnormal, uh... length of life for a frog? You would think, but I actually called the company and I was like, "I have this super old frog," and they said, "Oh," like, the oldest frog they have on record is 27. - Hi. - Like you were saying earlier. Like, um... Just like... Wow, I'm still doing this. I'm still living... still have a roommate. Um... Yeah, I know, it's like... you hit a point where you're like, "This is not how I pictured my life - at this age." - Mm-mm. Like, I thought I was going to be, like, more put together. Like, just... Just the pieces that you're told... told that you'll have when you're a kid. Like, you know, you'll have a husband, and children, and a house, and a yard, and a dog, and, like... I have a roommate. I mean, I love her. She's amazing, but... I feel like there's a lot of missing pieces, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I fantasize about just having a house. Yeah, that'd be really nice. Especially, like... I mean, right now, I can't afford a house. I... I... I've been looking. I always look at Zillow. - I love to look in, like, my neighborhood. - Same. What can I afford in my neighborhood? What can't I afford? Yeah. I'm glad that we're both addicted to Zillow. I mean, how can you not be? I feel a little... a little less alone. I feel seen. I feel heard. - Wow. [laughs nervously] - Well... - I guess I'll see you at work. - See you... See you at... at work. - Yeah, I hope soon. - Yeah. Um... Okay, well, you know where to find me. - You know where to find me. - [horn blares] - Are you going this way? - I'm going... - Okay, then that's less awkward. [laughs] - Okay. - All right, take care. Have a good one. - Bye. I'm so glad I changed my mind and asked him to go and hang out. If I had just said no and... and missed this... like... I'm just... feeling really happy. - Are you gonna see him again? - He wanted to hang out Saturday. I have dinner plans, but, um... we're gonna go... go grab some brunch. - So, yeah. - Okay. - Cool. Yeah. - Brunch date. [chuckles] - Sorry. I'm just talkin' your ear off. - No, I love it. - You're just like... - Oooh! - beaming. - [laughs] - [Lucas]Hey. - [Annie] Oh, hey. - How's it going? - Good. How are you? - Good to see you. - Sorry, did I step on your foot? - No, oh, you're fine. - [laughs] Yeah, I have to say that that was one of the... better, if not the best... dates... that I've been on in recent history. Me too. For sure. And I've been on a lot of dates. - You've been on a lot lately. - Yeah. I'm really glad you got me out of... I was in such a funk that day. - Yeah. - Sometimes, it just takes one little thing to, like... turn the day around. Any time. Any time. So, do you have any fun things happening this weekend? Well... I do this thing sometimes where, uh... I just go and check out a bunch of open houses. - Oh, that's fun. - Um, yeah, stuff that I can afford, stuff I could never afford, but... it's kind of fun just to see what's out there. So there's a couple that I wanna hit, uh, today. Oh, wow. Yeah, actually, as much as I look at Zillow and Redfin, I... I've actually never gone to any of those places. I guess 'cause in my mind, it's still a little... little bit out of reach, but... - But, wow. That would be really fun... - But the thing is, they have no idea. - That's true, they don't know. [laughs] - Mm-mm. We could roll up there together, say that, I don't know, we're... we're... tech billionaires, and they wouldn't know. [laughs] - That's so... - Should we, like, have fake names? - Yes. - Uh, I feel like I should try out, like... maybe, like, a couple of different terms of endearment per... per house. - Sounds like the most fun. That's... - You don't have any plans? Um... Not... Not until I have... I have a dinner tonight, but, um... But, yeah, I'm around. - Let's do it. - We'll be done by then. All right. - You look like a Pamela. - Really? - Oh, I'll take it. - I can see it. You know what? I'm gonna move my ring, so it looks like I'm a married lady. - Oh, nice! - [laughs] Feel free to roam around. Let me know if you have any questions. - Here's a little bit more information. - Thank you. It's a complete gut rehab. Everything inside is brand new. - Nice. - Awesome. - Nice skylight. - I like it. I like it. - Natural light. - Oh, yeah. - We would have to get a better bed. - Really? - It's like a... - Ouch! - Feels fancy. - I'm a sucker for that. Yeah, I like it. I'll take it. So are you guys pre-approved already? Yeah. Oh, yeah. We have a few houses. - It's not our first property. - Really? - Yeah. - We're looking to expand. - Wow. - Thinking about a family, so... - Naturally... - Love the kids' room and... - Yeah! - Yeah, - It's great. - It's a perfect family home. - See this thermostat? - Oh. Nest. You can operate it from your iPhone. That's right. - Yeah. - Really? You're looking at a great double oven, stainless appliances. How large of a family do you wanna have? Uh, we... We don't know. Sky's the limit. - ♪ Rockin' and makin' more money ♪ - [Lucas] Yeah! What? [laughs] I mean, we have so much money because we have a tech company... - Don't blow our cover, man. - Hm! He was right. You could have a lot of kids in this house. [Lucas] Yeah. Come on in. Nice. This is so cute. - It's all right. - I love it. [laughs] - Home. - This is super great. Yeah. Cool. - Nice Baldwin. - Yeah. [plays piano] [chuckles] - I'm still married. - I know. - [laughs] - I've made an honest woman of you. You can do that again sometime. Cool. Do you know the time? Uh... It's... Ooh. 7:15. Uh... - Whoa. You all right? - Uh, yeah. No, I'm good. I just, um... I'm late for... a thing. - You got plans? - Uh... I... I have a... I have a date. - You have a date? - Yeah. - I mean, I... I... - Oh. It's a second date, actually. Um... Yeah. [sighs] Phew! You still doing the "saying yes to everyone" thing? Yeah, just for... until the end of the month, but I, um... I actually had said yes to him, like, even before you and I went on our first date. - Oh. - Um... So I just... you know. Um... But I... I had a... a really great time with you today. You know? It was just a really special day. - Yeah. - And I hope that we get to... - do this again. - I do, too. [chuckles] Okay, cool. Um... - Well, thank you. Thank you so much. - Sure. Yeah. I don't know why I'm going. I have no idea. I just... I feel like I committed. And now, I... I left the... What are you doing? Why? Uh... I... I said yes to him, like, I don't know... a week and a half ago. I feel bad to cancel on him right now, like, last minute. Just seems like it really wouldn't be nice, you know? You're really cute right now. You're very, um... I know, I feel so, like... Argh! I'm, like, buzzy. - I know. - I feel like... Like, uh... Like, uh... I don't know what I feel like! Hey. - Hey. - Sorry, I'm a little late. - Oh, that's okay. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. How are you doing? - I'm good. - A little... Crazy day. I, uh... - Cool. - Yeah. I'm so hungry. You hungry? - Yeah. Yeah. Um... So it's all stream of consciousness, and she's just hearing things and she's, like... A couple of these editors and publishers were, like, "Well, why don't you make it? We wanna see the bank heist. We don't wanna just hear about it." I was, like, "Well, it's not about a bank heist. It's about this woman who's worried if she's gonna see her daughter again." And you know, so I was just, like, really fed up with the whole process and, um... Are... you okay? I... I've been talking forever, I'm sorry. - Oh. - I just get frustrated about this. No, uh, I've got... You know, I... [chuckles] I... I'm so sorry. I.. I... I... [laughs] I have to tell you... I just want to... I... I met somebody and, um... It's sort of unexpected, and I... I actually, um... I just think it's... it's, uh... It feels really different with... with, uh, him, and I just don't feel like I'm being fair in... having a date with you right now. I'm so sorry. I... Dinner is on me. I... I just wanted to be... upfront and tell you that, and I'm... I'm really sorry. But, uh, you're... you're so nice, and... and I... I... Your book sounds awesome. Like, met a guy today or... Well, uh, a... a couple of days ago, - and then we, uh, had a brunch date today. - Okay. And then that was why I was, uh, a little late, 'cause brunch led to... - uh, looking for houses and I... - I've been through it. You know, you could've just texted me. - Hm. - You know. - I'm sorry. - I'm an adult. You know. It's all right. Whatever. I mean, I'm not gonna flip out or anything, but it's like, you know... - Yeah, you... - Yeah, I just thought, you know, I... You know, I like you. I thought it was... I don't know. I thought it was going well. I wanted you to come to this book thing next week, but whatever. But yeah, it's fine. Whatever, you know. Do you wanna stay, or you wanna... you wanna go, or, I mean, um... Oh, um... That, you know, that's totally up to you. If you feel comfortable, wanna finish eating, or... do you wanna get a to-go box? Uh... Not really... super hungry... anymore. I get that. - [phone vibrates] - [man talking on TV] [turns TV off[] - Hello? - [Annie] Hey, Lucas. I... I just wanted to say I'm really sorry for how I left our date. It was really not cool of me. [chuckles] I don't know what I was thinking. That's okay. - [chuckles] - How was the date? Um... Well, date number two was, uh... not so good. [chuckles] I... I pretty much tanked it 'cause I... I couldn't stop thinking about you, and I... I realized that I... I don't wanna be on a date with anybody else. So I, uh... Yeah, I told him I... I had to go. So no more, uh... no more yeses? No, I... I think, um... I think I'm done with that. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, I don't really wanna go out on any dates, um... anymore either, uh, I mean... unless they're with you. Yeah, well... That would be great. Okay. Um... Well, I will... I'll see you soon. Yeah, I'll see you real soon. I'll see you... uh... um... - I'll see you at work. - Okay. Good night, Lucas. Bye. Argh... Ooh! [sighs] Hah! - No, I don't want to. - Oh, he's a little bit scary? - Hm. - What do you think his name is? Um... - Lily. - Lily? - Hello, Lily. - Hello, tiny Lily. - Hello! - [chuckles] - Lily's an old friend. - Oh, yeah. Hello. - Oh, hey. - Hey. - Hi. - How are you doing? - I'm good. Thanks so much for coming. - Good to see you. Of course. - This is Samantha.
