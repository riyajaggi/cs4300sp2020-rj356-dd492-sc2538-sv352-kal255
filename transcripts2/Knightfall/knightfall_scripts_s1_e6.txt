 Brother Tancrede, you will be punished until you repent. Do you really think I wanted to go back to bed with Philip?! I'm with child. Goodbye. Did it work? Exactly as you planned. I don't want anyone to think your King did it. I want them to think you did it. Do you know who I am? You're Malraux.

 What is he saying? Godfrey left you the way to find the Grail. Wind is still against you, Landry. - Rashid. - You wanted to talk. Has anybody seen Adelina? Where is she? - She went after him. - Roland? She finds him, she'll be dead by now anyway. Leave my people alone! Simple job. I pay you, you bring me the boy. You couldn't even do that. You already ruined Parsifal's life. Why do you need to take it?

 I see. You like him. Aww. What's so funny? Hear that? It's the vespers bell. Vespers bell? It means the changing of the guard. What? Send for the Templars. They're looking for this man. The Pilgrimage of Chains sync and corrected by ninh www.addic7ed.com. Look who it is! Little soldier boy! Don't rise to it. Remember what we said. Adelina! Adelina. I got him for you. Take her to the infirmary. Get this one to the dungeons. Brother Gawain, the master's bed has not been slept in. The guards say he did not return to the temple last night. He's gone. Scour the city! Landry is missing. Take every available man! Find your Master. They will not find him. This was the Brotherhood of Light. Landry is missing. He hasn't been seen since last night. Draper believes the Brotherhood of Light may have taken him. You were the last one to see him. Do you know where he went? He is still your master. Will you say nothing? He wanted to talk to them. Maybe he's talking. All night? What do you want me to say? You know as well as I do... If he's not returned, he's probably dead. Having been found guilty of conspiring with the Earl of Oxford to assassinate the royal court, you shall be hanged by the neck until you are dead! We are innocent! Our master was innocent! We are innocent! William... You saved my wife and possibly the entire court. Thank you. I am merely your humble servant, Your Grace. Though, it is gratifying to know that the King of England has already sent letters agreeing to our return to friendly relations. We have recently annexed your homelands near Montpellier, did we not? Yes, Your Grace. Choose an estate there, and it will be yours. Thank you, Your Grace. And I shall name you Sir William... In recognition of this great service to the Crown. Truly, I do not deserve it, Your Grace. After all these years, William, it's time you called me Philip. - Isabella! - Your Grace, allow me... No. I'll go. This was my doing... This whole business with Lluis... You can't blame yourself. You weren't to know that a madman would orchestrate an attack on the royal court. It's more than that... You don't understand... What don't I understand? I... I... I just miss him. You're still grieving. We must expect this. Yes? Sir. Your visitor is here. I trust his arrival was kept secret? Side gate. No one saw us. I must confess, he seems more civil than I expected. Don't be fooled, he is the most dangerous man in all of France. 65. That is the number of Templar sites planted throughout Europe. Thousands of knights. And one of their largest temples is right here in Paris. Philip does not see that the Templars are an army camped on his doorstep... Loyal, not to France, but to the Pope. He cannot do what needs to be done. And so it falls to me. Now that the Princess' marriage to Catalonia is null, we must proceed to the next step of my plan... Meaning? Meaning, Uncle, that the Pope must be dealt with, and we must recover the Grail for ourselves. Strong words, Nephew. Strong words. Open the gates! Master! Landry. Landry. What happened? What did they do to you? No... They set me free. Why? Master, there is something you need to know. Godfrey's killer, Roland, has been found. We have him under lock and key, but so far he has not... Here? In the Temple? Open it! Stand up. Stand up. Your men already tried. I said, stand up. I spent three years in the dungeons of Egypt... Who sent you to kill Godfrey? Where is it? You tell me what you know! Where is the Grail?! Where is it!? Landry, you'll kill him. Landry! Please, Landry! Stop! What has happened to you? I need to speak to Tancrede. Master, not like this. Like what? Get out of my way. They let you live? I told you. I will never repent. The time for repentance has passed. Brother Tancrede. Take your armor and report to the blacksmith. My armor? You won't repent. All that's left is God's final judgment. You are to be expelled from the Temple. Here's your army. 2,000 trained men ready and waiting. 2,000? I wanted 5,000. You can't afford 5,000. These are fighting men. They need to eat. They need to get their ends away. And they need to be paid. You want a bigger army, find more money and stop dithering. The Princess' betrothal has taken up much of my effort. To what end exactly? Her marriage to Catalonia would have strengthened the Pope. Soon the Pope will be dead and the Grail will be ours. She can ride whoever she likes, it doesn't matter. Her name is Isabella. And it matters to France... Which is my paramount concern. You always were a posturing little shit. I'm sorry I could never beat the pomp right out of you... You certainly tried. - Get over it. - I am over it! You took me in when there was no one else. I will always be grateful. Maybe I was hard on you. You reminded me of my brother. Every time I saw you. Made my blood boil. He was a beautiful man. And they burned him like an animal. I know. I was there. Then steel your resolve, Nephew. You came to me with this... plot. For your father, and my brother, have the courage to see it through. I assure you, nothing ever stands in my way. Are you sure we did the right thing? - I have not slept. - Yes. You need to compose yourself. Be circumspect... Everyone is watching you. Do not be tempted to say more than you should. - I haven't. - You were too emotional at the hanging. You must be seen to be grieving, but not so much that you will be sent away. - I don't think I can do this. - Of course you can. You are not alone in this... You have me. You will always have me. Thank you for watching over me. Your Grace, this is... Malraux. One of my assistants. My condolences on the death of your husband, Your Grace. Perhaps, Malraux, it's time you went back to my office. We have much work to do. At once, Sir. By the Templar Rule, as punishment for your crimes, your armor will be made into chains. You will wear the chains around your neck and wander for one year and one day... No. He won't. The Pilgrimage of Chains is a penance for brothers who are permitted to return. Tancrede is expelled, never to return. Now, you take what you came here with and you go. You watch over him. Something has happened. Something is wrong. No!! Lord, I know I've abandoned you. I betrayed my brothers and you. But please, Lord, please. Please. Joan, our child... Rashid! What was your mother's name? Even if I remembered, I wouldn't tell you. I was Godfrey's friend. You must know that by now. Godfrey would never befriend you. We worked together to protect the Grail. Now you must tell me what I need to know to find it. If Godfrey was your friend, why didn't he tell you? Shall I tell you what Godfrey wrote on the scroll? The scroll burned and the only man that saw it is dead. I knew what it said because I was there when Godfrey wrote it. - It was a question. - I don't believe you. A question that only you can answer. Tell me your mother's name. Is that it?! Is that the question on the scroll? Who was she? I would rather die than help you. What was her name? You control your own agony. Tell me her name and you will be free. Your defiance proves you have no idea. What the Grail is. What it can do. How it must be protected. I... am a Templar! In service to God... One answer and your suffering will end. My suffering... Is for God's glory... It's for his glory... What of her pain? Will your Queen endure? Will your child...? You said I was the only woman you ever loved. Who is your mother? What was her name? You're beautiful... What was your mother's name?! Drink and be gone. You have business to attend to, and so do I. I am to be knighted by the King. It all makes sense now. What exactly is that? All this delay... It's the girl. If Isabella can become the woman she is capable of becoming... She will one day rule England and fortify France. The ruler her father could never be. It's far more than that, isn't it? I saw you with her. It wasn't the Earl of Oxford who killed her husband... It was you. You actually poisoned yourself? To undo her marriage? As I said, my only interest is in ensuring she becomes the formidable ruler she is capable of being. I think of her as nothing more than a child. You think of her with your rod. Never mention her in that way again. Do you hear me? Now... Can I trust you to get me my army or should I find a new ally? I'll get you the army. Just be ready... and thinking with your head... when I do. You said I was the only woman you ever loved. Hold me in your arms. I have no strength left. But I waited and waited for you... You never came. Why didn't you come? I made a mistake... Wake up. What future does a Templar have with the wife of the King? My child... Philip will raise your child as his own... Wake up. Our child will not know you... Wake up! We must go. We must leave. Quickly. This way. Why are you helping me? We've met before, you and me. - Where? - That day in the dunes... You were a boy on the horse with Godfrey. Come on. We must hurry. For your loyalty and service to the King and crown of France... Rise, Sir William. Congratulations, William. Thank you, Your Grace. I know that we haven't always seen eyetoeye, but I want to thank you for saving my life. I would gladly sacrifice myself for the sake of the kingdom. And for that you have my sincere gratitude. Congratulations. Thank you, Your Grace. You deserve this. After everything you've done. Not just for France... but for me. You saved me from making a terrible mistake. You know I am forever in your service. Come to your office after this. I have something for you. If anybody found out, there'd be a scandal. It will be a secret between us. I will not tell it to a soul. Where's De Nogaret? How dare you?! Your Grace, what has happened? Perhaps we should speak in private? Private? Interesting choice of words! What is this all about? He's fooled you all! He murdered Lluis! Clear the hall. Guards! Everyone out. Now! What's happened? What is the meaning of this? De Nogaret, he did it. It was him. - Princess, please... - He tricked me into helping... I was angry with Lluis for what he did. For telling his mother our most... Intimate secret. Then it was true? We were in love. Father, forgive me. Lluis didn't tell... He did. He lied to me so I could help him cover up his crime! You had Lluis killed? And... And Oxford? The threat of war with England, the... the horse? - The whole affair? - Your Grace... The Earl of Oxford tried to kill the entire court... Dear God... Did you poison yourself? Yes, he did! And he had me give him the remedy! Madness. What on Earth possessed you? Catalonia was a weak choice and you would not heed my advice. I do not make weak choices. It would have been better for France... I decide what is best for France. I am France! Then ask yourself... Why did you choose Catalonia? For France? Or to appease your wife? Get this man out of my sight. Rashid was lying. It was "the place you were born." That's the message Godfrey left you on the scroll. That's where the Grail resides. It wasn't your mother's name. Do you know where you were born? Perhaps... Good. Do not tell me. Godfrey meant for you and you alone to find it. Yet he didn't trust me enough to tell me himself? He loved you. You know this. Why would a Christian... A Templar Master... Join the Brotherhood of Light? We are not only Saracens. We are Christians, we are Jews. With one goal... To protect the Grail. Why? It's a Christian relic. It's much more than that. Godfrey understood. And he intended for you to understand when you were ready. He told us how you risked everything for the Grail, running with the box, running for your young life. True. But the Grail wasn't in the box. But your courage was there. How old were you then? I was still a boy. I must have been... I don't know. We should find some food... Can I ask you something? Was this your plan, or Rashid's? You rescue me, put me offguard, and then get me to talk about something in my past with Godfrey? What are you saying? There is no... plan. The Grail is not where I was born, is it? - This is a trick. - Landry! I give the answer that you are looking for without even realizing it... And then you and Rashid, you go and get the Grail? Very clever, but it's not clever enough. Rashid! Rashid! I know you're here, come on. Come on! I should have killed you 15 years ago in Acre. Open the door and leave us. Before you make assumptions, let me explain. How long have you been watching me? - Princess... - In my bed? You are the only one of them who could be a true ruler. But you need a man like me to do what is necessary. Did you watch me at 13 when I was changing into my undergarments? At 9 when I was stepping onto my mother's feet to dance? At 5, when I was playing... My motive was to protect you, to protect your interests... By turning me against the man I loved? In fairness, you did not need much help. Tell me... Did you pleasure yourself while you watched me? Isabella... - Did you?! - I swear to God. Then that's my answer. What? You don't believe in God. You will hang tomorrow. And I will have a peaceful night's sleep, knowing that no one is watching. But you remember... If you kill me, then the Grail is lost to you forever. I have no choice but to live with that possibility. Unless you let me find the Grail as Godfrey intended. And why would I do that? Because we're not the only ones searching for it. The men who killed Godfrey, they weren't just highwaymen. Are you prepared for them to find the Grail? I cannot trust you. When the time comes, you will not do what must be done! If you tell me what you know, I swear I will find the Grail and I will protect it as Godfrey did. You must prove yourself to us. I must prove myself... How? Back in Acre... I told you to surrender or die, that we would defeat you. Remember how easily that defeat came? Because somebody let your men into the tunnels. Yes. But who? The traitor was never found. The traitor was Godfrey. That is a lie. You are not ready to understand the lengths to which we must go. Godfrey was not a traitor. He would never betray the Temple. All of those men... The civilians, the women, the children... No. He let thousands be killed to save the millions that would surely die if the Grail's power fell into the wrong hands. You, too, must be willing to make a sacrifice. What kind of sacrifice? Deliver to us your brother. The one who murdered my son. That is your task. Do that, and I will tell you how to find the Grail. Dear God. Must I lose everyone I love for this quest...? Joan. Tancrede. My child? I'm lost... Bring him back. Give him up. I cannot. You must. I cannot give him up. I can't give him up. I don't want to give them up. I can't... I can't... There was someone at the gates for you. He left this. What is happening here? The Brotherhood of Light are waiting. What for? They want me to give them Tancrede in exchange for what's written on the scroll. Then why did you send Tancrede away? Because I will not give up my brother. Tancrede was a traitor. If it meant getting the Grail... No. No. They can have me. I'm the Temple Master. I must take responsibility. I'll come with you. - We can assemble the entire Temple. - No! This is something only I can do. Adelina! I wanted to say goodbye. And give you this. It's from the Temple. Take your people to safety in the south. As good as this money is, last time we tried to leave Paris, we were attacked on the road. The last time you and I tried to leave Paris, you almost got me killed. Almost. Don't. You're not a monk yet. I was going to sell you this... I saw Roland having this written. A message. I thought you might be able to use it. A message to who? I don't know. But it could be who he's working for. You might figure out what he's been up to. Be careful. You've come alone. What is this?! I am responsible for everything that happens in the Temple. You gave us your word... The murderer for the message. I do not want to find the Grail if it means even one of my brothers is lost. I'm not Godfrey. I'm not a traitor. Nor will I ever be. Then the Grail is lost to us both. Wait. I am the man you're looking for. I killed your son. He was going to tell us how to find the Grail, but I took his prophecy to heart. Look at all we've lost. I believe the Grail should not be found. God does not want it to be found. But I'm not God... And it was not my place to act on His behalf. And for that... I am willing to face His judgment. Tancrede, they will make you suffer. I was ready to die when I took my oath. And I am ready to die now. Master... I repent my sins to the Temple. I accept your repentance, Brother. I forgive you. Find the Grail if you must. Guard it. Keep it from the hands of men. Now you have my Brother. Will you tell me what I need to know to find the Grail? Go back to the place where you first met Godfrey. It is there you will find what you seek. There is much to do once you find the Grail. We will be ready. Ready for what? To serve you. Bring him. William De Nogaret, you are guilty of treason and murder. If you have anything to say in accordance with the laws of France, speak now. All I do... All I have done... Is for France. For the benefit of the crown! Even to the last, weasel words to justify your crimes. You shall be hanged until death takes you. Guards! I told you the girl was trouble. De Nogaret! De Nogaret!
