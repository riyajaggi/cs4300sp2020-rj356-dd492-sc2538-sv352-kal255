 - Goodbye. - Isabella! Queen Elena's armies have taken hostages. I'm sure your cousin Joan will not let it pass. I should hope not. What kind of queen would I be if I did not defend my people? The queen rode out of Paris and into battle. And with child. Landry has been with a married woman, one who bears his child. "I need more men, I.V." It means he was working for someone.

 What's his name? No mercies... I know who he's working for. I need to warn Landr... We will be ready to serve you, once you find the Grail. I'm taking the Grail. You gave Tancrede over to the Saracens knowing what they would do to him. Don't make me kill you. This cup has made madmen of us all. The Temple is not safe for you or the Grail. Why? You're making a mistake. Because this will be the death of you. And because I'm your mother. Cousin Joan, you are surrounded.

 You are outnumbered four to one. Elena, as your cousin... your blood... I ask you not to continue with this attack. Think of the loss of life it will cause. You are a grieving mother. Do not let another woman suffer as you suffer. You know nothing about my suffering. In the castle you're currently occupying lies our grandfather's grave. My son should be laid to rest there, right next to his great-grandfather, and I will not rest until it is so. Elena, if this is about a grave, let us end this here and now. You have my permission to bury Lluis. Your permission? Elena, what do you want from me? If it's capitulation, you're going to be disappointed. I will have your capitulation, but I want something else, too... restitution. Restitution for my murdered son. I warn you, your soldiers will die. My men will stand firm until the arrival... Until what? Until your husband's reinforcements come? I don't think so, my dear. You're behind with the news. Your husband has changed his mind. No one's coming to save you. You're alone. Your Grace, these men come with a letter from the King. Unfortunately, there is disappointing news. He's not sending troops. You are to return to France immediately. We must concede to your cousin. We most certainly will not! How thick are our walls? Not thick enough. And our supplies? A month of grain... if we ration. Have the Merinos send word to their men still in the countryside. Bring supplies and troops. Use the river to enter the castle. What? Speak. You failed to halt Elena's aggression and to secure reinforcements from your husband. The Merinos think you're weak. They will not follow your orders. Then they disobey their Queen. And that is treason. Navarre has no Queen! This is not France. Our people do not revere titles. Your mother never understood that. I am not my mother. And I would give my life for my people. I fear you will, if you remain here. Let him through! Let him through. Brothers, it has been 15 years since we lost Acre. And 15 years since we lost this Holy Cup. But now it returns to our safekeeping and that of the Church. Dear God. Gawain? I can't believe it. The pain in his leg drove him to madness. Even so. To try to kill his Master? He asked me to let him drink from the Cup. And I refused. Perhaps I should have given him what he wanted. This is not your fault. Any word from the Pope? He is on his way. Excuse me, Master. May I have a word? What is it? It's Parsifal. He pretended to be from the Temple in Genoa and took Roland out to the Forest of Saint-Germain. He... He wanted to question him away from Templar purview. Forgive me. I allowed myself to be sworn to secrecy. I know I've done wrong, and... Parsifal has not returned. This is about the letter. What letter? Parsifal had a letter from Roland, asking for help. Help from whom? He refused to say. But he signed himself "I.V." As in four? Why was I not told about this before now? As you know, the prisoner was to go to Genoa on the Pope's own authority. He was no longer our concern. Bring me the letter. Parsifal has it. Tell Ulric to take a dozen men to Saint-Germain, find Parsifal, Roland, and this letter immediately. The forest is huge. Then take every available man! Am I understood?! Come on. Any clue where to start looking for the lad? None, I'm afraid. I have questions. Everyone has questions. How did you meet Godfrey? That's not what you wanted to ask me. I will tell you what I want to ask you. Big man, Master Templar. Who cares how I met Godfrey? He found me after Acre, after you came running back to Paris with your tails between your legs. So you knew I was here this whole time? I did. I couldn't... come visiting for cake. I was... I was busy. Too busy for your own child? Yes! Don't bleat. Godfrey gave me a task. To protect the Grail. Keeping away was part of it. And I'm still protecting the Grail. That's why you have to trust me when I say you can't give the Grail to the Pope. Why not? If you don't give me a good reason, I'll make my own decision. Landry, the people who killed Godfrey are still out there. You don't think I know that? Master, there's a man here to see you. Master Templar. Congratulations. You have retrieved the Cup. But I believe we had an agreement. I gave you the information you needed to find the Grail. Now we must work together to keep it safe. No. It is the Holy Grail. It belongs in the Holy Church. This is the bargain you struck with me. Then let me be damned for breaking that bargain. Landry, he's right. - You know him? - Rashid? We were never to meet until this day. That was Godfrey's plan. A separation of powers to protect the Grail. He knew the question, you knew the answer, and I knew the location. So this is Godfrey's plan. Then why did you try to prevent me from finding the Grail?! I never trusted you. You were always rash, foolhardy. Even in Acre. I have given my life to the Grail. You know that. I also know you are sentimental. You have relationships. You are having a child. And you would torture me for that? I needed to know whether you had the mettle to make the decisions that would come before you. And I still don't know. But now you have the Grail, and we must keep it safe again. There are secure places that Godfrey had prepared. You must choose one to house the Grail. Then you will choose a successor, just as Godfrey chose you. You will pick a question only they can answer... No! No more questions! Godfrey's way did not work in Acre, and it did not work here. His Holiness, the Pope, is on his way. I will give him the Cup, and together we will take it to Rome. That's a mistake. He'll use it to call for another crusade. That is his prerogative. What for? So fools can fight for the rest of time? I don't trust either of you. You took Tancrede. He was a good man. Twice the man I am, and twice the man you are. Yes. A very good man. Master, we have received word... His Holiness, the Pope, is arriving. I do have the mettle. To make my own choice for the Grail. And I'm afraid neither of you are part of it. Guards! Malraux didn't tell me it was you. You didn't need to know. Why does the former Keeper of the Seal require mercenaries? Because mercenaries are not distracted by Gods or symbols. True. We worship coin and the man who pays it. I want only your best men. The ones who fought in the Crusades. I have plenty. Skilled men. Bastards, to be honest. I may need some sooner than I thought. How soon? Soon. If you pay, we play. I will have the money. I thought you were out of favour in court. Just a little. So how are you going to pay? Let me worry about that. Don't shout. I am an important man... an adviser in the King's court. I know. I appointed you. De Nogaret? Shh. The King's Guard is searching for you. The King's Guard are out whoring, but let's not split hairs. What do you want? I am the King's adviser. And I intend to advise him. Is it true? Do you have it? I do. Oh, God has truly blessed us this day. So plain. Why should I be surprised? Jesus was a simple man. I'll escort you and the Grail to Rome. I have enough men. Fear not. Your work is done. What will you do now? With the Grail? I will launch a fresh Crusade. What better symbol to lead us back to the Holy Land? Is that... What? I, too, imagined we would return to fight for the Holy Land. Now I wonder if the bloodshed, if the loss of life solves anything. Oh, dear boy. This is the Saracens you've met. This is what they do... They sow doubt. I told you to put this out of your mind. This is a good thing. The word will spread. Our brothers across Europe will hear the call. The armies of God will be reborn. Keep the faith. Et benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris, et Felii, et Spiritus Sancti. The men o were after the Grail, who killed Godfrey... They're still out there. The prisoner, Roland, he was working for someone. Let it be, my son. We have the Grail. It is safe. He signed himself "I.V." As in four? How many knights are left in the Temple? You said to send everyone. I want every remaining man with me. Quickly. Master, what's going on? "I.V." is the mark of a Pope's Guard. What?! The Pope's Guard has Roman numerals on the back of their collar. Roland was working for the Pope. Come! Quickly! Holy Father. What's troubling you, my son? You told me not to pursue the man behind Godfrey's death. Now I understand why. Your Guard. Number IV. Goes by the name of Roland. We've seen a letter he was going to send to you. Landry, someone's poisoning you against me. I don't believe you. Why did you have Godfrey killed? He possessed the Grail, and he refused to turn it over to the Church. There is a war to be fought, Landry, not in the Holy Land, but here. The Cup has the power to bring together all the countries of Europe into one single state. And this is the future of our Church... Europe united under the one true God. No heretics, no kings... Just you. I am the Pope. God will judge your papacy. God will. You won't. Lay down the Grail. You cannot win this, Landry! Pierre! Don't let them out! Pierre! What are you doing? Traitor! I will kill you! No! Kill them all! Get His Holiness to safety! Don't be a fool! There are too many of them. You've lost the Grail. You're not throwing away your life. I don't like it. She knows we're outnumbered. Why doesn't she move against us? Perhaps Queen Elena was more struck by your courage than she revealed? Thank you, but I fear nobody here was struck by my courage. My mother left me in France when I was just a girl. She abandoned Navarre, and she abandoned me. I was scared and alone. It's her weakness that my people here see in me. You are not weak, Your Grace. Of course I am. I'm weak, and I'm foolish. I'm my mother's daughter. Your Grace, there is still time to get you to safety. No. Your Grace's presence is requested at a meeting of the War Council. Who called this meeting? I did, Your Grace. Next time, seek my permission first. Of course, Your Grace. Cousin. Elena. How did... This castle is even finer than I remembered. Bastard. Your Grace will forgive me. King's orders... no bloodshed. You are to return to France. And to him. You may leave us, Governor. But our agreement was that I would take the Queen to Paris. Perhaps you will. First I have business with her. Your Grace. My apologies for the interruption. What is it, Nicholas? I'll have your head for this, boy! Nicholas had no choice. I would have had his head if he did not bring me here. - Guards. - Listen to me. Your Grace, please, you need to hear what I have to say. - Guards! - The Holy Grail is in France. Leave us. The Holy Grail. The Cup of Christ. I know what it is. But it is more than just a cup. It is the means with which the Pope will attempt to supplant you as King. I have not missed your papal conspiracies, De Nogaret. Your Grace, you are in the utmost danger from all sides. There is an army on French soil, trained and funded like no other army in history, and loyal not to you, but to the Pope. So this is about the Templars. No, this is about securing your throne. I have mustered an army of mercenaries... the Red Knights. Men who know war and know how the Templars fight. I do not need an army to fight the Templars! The Temple Master is my closest friend! Your Grace, Landry Du Lauzon is not your friend. You're right. He's my brother. Then Your Grace will forgive me, but your brother is sleeping with your wife. You've won. What more do you want from me? I told you. Reparation. For my son's death. I watched him burn alive after he tried to save your daughter on your soil. Where he should have been safe. Lluis' death is a tragedy, but the levels of De Nogaret's treachery could not be foreseen. De Nogaret did not act alone. He had an accomplice... your daughter. No! Isabella herself was nearly killed! Yet she leapt from the carriage the moment before it went up in flames. You know she was involved, don't you?! I lost a child, cousin. Now you will lose one, too. You choose: either the scheming strumpet back in France... or... the one that grows in your womb. They have at least 30 men out there. That's too many to fight our way through. We can't keep them out forever. We don't have to. We just have to hold out until Ulric gets back with the others. What if they don't return in time? We cannot get to the armoury. We'll have to fight with what we have. Gather every weapon you can find. Rashid... I'm sorry. I should have listened. Enter formation! Landry saved my marriage, spoke to the Queen on my behalf, convinced the Queen to return to my bed. He is the reason we are having another child. A child that is not yours. By God, you have some nerve. Your Grace, think for a moment. She would not share your bed for two years. But then we were reconciled. I would guess after she discovered she was with child. So that she could hide her transgression from you. How do you claim to know this? I have a man inside the Temple. Landry confessed to him. He mentioned Joan by name? Not exactly, Your Grace. Well, then this is all hearsay... slander. Lies. Your Grace, if she did not come to your bed for two years, whose bed was she going to? Guards! Confine him to his office. He's not to leave the Palace. Do you know how to use that? Here. Attack! Seal the doors. Seal the doors! Aah! Rashid! Rashid... Hold him. Bite it. I did the same thing for your son. He didn't scream half as much as you. You showed him kindness. It wasn't enough to save him. He died in service of the Grail. It was an honourable death. What will we do, though, now? Your Grace. I cannot believe my army has capitulated. What other choice did they have? Your Governor told them it was France's wish. Forgive me, Your Grace, but, uh... Queen Elena requests your decision. So, cousin. Which of your bastards will it be? You cannot ask a mother to give up a child. That is exactly what I'm asking. Elena, please. Choose one, or I'll choose both. Choose! Isabella! Good choice. There is justice there. She thought Lluis had betrayed her. You must understand: She was being manipulated by De Nogaret. Blood must be repaid with blood. You will see that she is brought to Navarre. Her death will not ease your pain. Sometimes at night, I can still smell him burning. My... My son. My flesh and blood... Give me your hand. This baby in my belly... It, too, is your blood. I feel it. I feel it. Oh, God. What am I doing? What... What am I doing? Something any mother would do. Defend her child. Catalans! Your Queen is dead. I came here to fight you in defense of my homeland. But I have seen how readily your people and mine stand alongside one another. You do not want this enmity. And you never wanted it. Let this day be the last day of blood between our two countries. And let it be the first day of the longest peace between Catalonia and Navarre. Real! Queen Joan! Real! Real! We've sealed all the doors. Do you hear that? They're on the roof. That is quicklime! Move! Move. Move! Everybody, get out now! It's poison! To the entrance hall! Move! Move! A part of me would kill you, De Nogaret, and have all of this go away. My life depends upon your wisdom and mercy, Your Grace. I require proof. I will introduce you to my man in the Templars. Not testimony. Proof. I will look into this, and if you are wrong, De Nogaret... Believe me, Your Grace, I wish I were wrong. About the threat from the Templars. And about your wife. Guards. What's this? To pay for your mercenary army. In case you're right. Your Grace, our countries are united. Catalonia has pledged support for the Queen of Navarre. Evidently your cousin was not popular there. And you? Will you return to Paris? Yes. But I may be back sooner than you think. It will be our privilege. Thank you. You intend to return? Yes. I will bring Isabella here. Away from the corruption of the French court. And then I will bring my child into the world under the skies of Navarre. Will the King allow it? The time has come for independence from France, Sophie. Both for myself and Navarre. Forgive me, Your Grace, but this new life of which you speak... will it include the child's father? If he will have me. We're running out of time. We're gonna have to charge out of the main doors. A frontal attack, take them by surprise. Pierre has at least 30 men out there. We have no other choice. Fall in behind me! Look to your training. Use God's strength to quiet your mind. We are His soldiers. And, remember, we answer only to God, and we fight for God. And we win by the Grace of God! By the Grace of God! Wait! Rashid? Let me help. Here they come! Ready! Charge! Aah! Looks like my time as a Templar has come to an end. You were never a Templar. Landry! Landry. Place these on my son's grave. It would be an honour to do so. Forgive me. It suited me to let you think he would die. Who would die? Tancrede. Master. .srt Extracted, Synced and Corrected by Dan4Jem, AD.I.MMXVIII
