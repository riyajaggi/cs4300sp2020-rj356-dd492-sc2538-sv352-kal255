 Charge! Aah! Isabella's favorite stallion. A gift to England. Unless you return the hand of your daughter to Prince Edward, you will have war. Isn't a sin to be together before we marry?

 on the farm, boy. No witnesses. - Marcel De Caux was Godfrey. - One sip of wine from the Cup of Christ, and his brother was healed. A miracle. Yes, madam. You're with child. I haven't shared the King's bed in two years. What future does the wife of a king have with a Templar? Madame, I beg you reconsider. A child is a blessing. Ask him what was on the scroll he burned. Tell him I will take his left eye first. The Grail will destroy you all. Paris will burn. You will burn.

 Seal the Temple. There's a murderer in our midst. On the service to the Temple... Forget not that we are the Temple, and the Temple is God. And in the Temple, we shall meet men of many religions and many nations. And we shall honor them. And we shall honor them! An injured man in our care was killed in cold blood! Well, that is not the Templar way. We should kill them. Who speaks? It's what we do. We fight Crusades. You saw the Saracens slaughter our brothers at Acre. This Saracen was important to us. An inquiry into the man's murder will be conducted by Brother Gawain. The killer will be found. And God's judgment will come down upon him. He Who Discovers His Own Self Discovers God sync and corrected by ninh www.addic7ed.com Landry, is there something you're not telling me? The mark on the Saracen's wrist... Did you see it? I did. What does it mean? I don't know, but it means something. A Saracen shouldn't mark his body. Well, Draper will recognize it. He's never seen it before. But I have when I was a boy, too young to remember where. Well, let's try the University. Someone there will tell us what it is. This is outside of Christian knowledge. I'll go to Jonas of the Ardennes. Jonas? He's a Pagan! He walks in darkness! Tancrede, I'm going. Then you won't be going alone. I need you here to watch over Gawain. Why? Gawain is capable, but he's prone to anger. See that he doesn't turn that anger on to our own men. I've been luckier than your sister, if that's what you're wondering. Some discomfort, but no grave ill effects from the medicine... except for small bouts of sadness. But what is done is done. Let's brace ourselves for my cousin's arrival. Elena, Queen of Catalonia! How long, do you think, before she mentions Navarre? I'd guess shortly before she tries to undo her son's promise of troops. Your Grace! Your visage, as ever, is even more beautiful than the minstrels describe. Then you must have the minstrels flogged. Cousin, I have recently visited your lands in Navarre. I hear the poppies are quite beautiful at this time of year. Pity you've never been there to see them. Happily, my people love me just the same. I understand my son has generously committed our troops to you. How lucky we are that the men of Catalonia will be fighting for the honor of a foreign king. They will be fighting for the honor of their new princess. Where is she? Where is my future daughter? - Let me see her. - Here I am, Your Grace. So beautiful! Look at these hips... Childbearing, like her mother. Cousin, let us hope she's as fertile as you. I regret that your Prince Lluis has overruled you on the troops. I regret everything about this marriage. Then we should stop it. How? There is something you may wish to whisper to your Queen about the Prince and the Princess. I didn't kill the Saracan. I would never violate the sanctity of the Temple. Perhaps you can speak on behalf of someone who would. Our brothers can speak for themselves. The initiates, however... they're a different story. I saw one of them roaming the halls near Draper's room before vespers. I was mucking out the stables with Edward, Albert, and... Pierre. And did they all do their duty? Telling me is not a betrayal, but a demonstration of loyalty to Godfrey, whom you watched die. Pierre was late. I was instructed by Draper to fetch clean bandages from the pantry. - And then? - I brought them, as asked. But that was long before your stable duties, and still you were late. I stopped to eat some bread and grapes. I took them from the pantry. I'm sorry. I was hungry. You may go. You're getting soft. What... Are you checking up on me? Landry. He merely wants me to support you in your inquiry. "Support my inquiry?" It's my leg that's injured, not my eyes. I have my orders. I'm following them. I suggest you do the same. Who's next? No one. It was the initiate, Pierre. When will we have this Parsifal? This needs to be done quickly. He will come today. Don't worry. When he does, you're to take him out to the Roman ruin at the second bell. Taking him out of Paris, that's not what we agreed. Tell your man it will cost more. Tell him yourself. I'm paying you, and you do as you're told. So, you finally came for the last heretic in France. If I meant to kill you, Jonas, I wouldn't have come alone. I need your help. How could I help you? I cannot swing a sword. I don't have the stomach to burn a town. I've come across a man with this symbol on his arm. Do you recognize it? I have never encountered such a mark. I have. But I don't know where. I was still a boy. I can't remember. Tell me what do remember of your childhood. I remember my mother... the smell of her hair. I remember Godfrey. And I remember a man, a terrible man. I just don't remember where I saw the symbol. You can remember. You know you can. Otherwise, why come to me... with my terrifying gods? You Christians... All that confidence in your Lord, but fear still rules you. You are safe here. My gods will do you no harm. Lie down. Breathe deeply. The Goddess of Destiny herself will guide you on your journey. May God keep you, my sweet Landry dream. I don't want this. Let go. Remember. Sir Godfrey, shall I have the sisters make up a bed in our guest house? Thank you, no. It's safer for you if I don't stay here. I'll make camp east of the city, near the Rock of Tears. I must be on the road to Jerusalem by first light. Very well. And may God watch over you. Can I come with you to Jerusalem? No. I can be a squire. You're not a squire. You're a boy who won't even do his chores. You're the one called Landry? Might be. Mother Superior tells me you might be the worst troublemaker here. Then she'll let me leave to be your squire. Can you groom a horse? Can you sharpen a blade? A good squire can do all this and more. You're a child, boy. Stay a child a little longer. Good evening, Mother. I am Malraux de Toulouse. And I'm looking for the Templar Knight who came visiting today. No Templar has passed this way for some time. Now, listen! Step back, friend, and be silent. Now you... you get out of here! Aah! I would ask you kindly not to lie to me. Where is the Templar named Godfrey? Don't make the sign of the cross, or I'll rip your arm off. Godfrey was here. Where is he now? He left after Mass. He took the road to Jerusalem. Leave him. What is this place? These are the people I told you about. No way to leave, no way to stay. The Jews. The amulet you stole... I want it back. The necklace. What necklace? Do you want me to get the King's guards down here? It's worthless anyway. It's worth more to me than your life. Hand it over. It's with my friend, outside of the city. I'll have to go and get it. No. I'm coming with you. Suit yourself. What's so special about this necklace, anyway? Who's it for? Is it your mother? My betrothed. And what, you gave her up for the Templars? Did you break her heart? Is that why you're giving her a necklace? She's not heartbroken. She's dead. Murdered... a crossbow bolt through the throat. I'm sorry. A highwayman called Roland... Pray you never meet him. I may be the only one to have seen his crimes and lived. Aren't you afraid he might find you? He's the one who should be worried. Did your mother say anything about me? - Yes. - What did she say? She said you were beautiful. You heard her yourself. I know, but that was in front of my mother and father. What about afterwards? What does she really think? Isabella, she adores you. Lluis! Prepare yourself. We are leaving. What is wrong, Your Grace? Has something happened? Nothing from you, strumpet. Mother! Mother! Mother, wait! What is wrong? By God, someone will hang for this. Your Grace, perhaps it is for the best... before she marries into such a family. - This wedding was never... - No. If word got out that my daughter's virtue was in question, her marriage prospects would be ruined. No. These lies must be crushed, along with the people who created them. They are lies, aren't they? Of course, Father. Good. You see how this poisonous gossip spreads? It was only once. - Why didn't you wait? - I'm sorry. This could ruin everything! I didn't think anyone would find out! You didn't think?! What if you're with child? I don't care! I want to be with child! I would give anything to hold a child born of our love, a child with his eyes. Mother? I'm sorry. It was different for you. You grew up with Father. You were a child when you married. You don't know what it's like... to meet a man, to marvel at the sound of his voice. You think you're the only woman to feel those feelings? No. But... Of course you do. That's the nature of it. It's as if the dawn bells ring only for you and your love. The sky is blue only for you. I didn't know you'd felt that. Are you sure you want this marriage? With all my heart. Then let's find a way. I'm afraid his mother is a viper. You realize I could ask the same question of your son? Men are weak in such matters. It's a woman's job to guard her own virtue. And she has! Do you call my daughter a liar? You promised us a rose, but have given us a thorn. Goodbye. Elena, wait! Is there no other way? A deflowered princess is worthless to anyone else. But although she is worth less to us, there is one solution. If you would consider further compensation. You want Navarre. Absolutely not. Navarre belonged to our grandfather. It was always supposed to be mine. We will not be extorted. Then the world will find out how easily the Princess of France parts her legs. Damn you. My daughter is virtuous. Prove it. Prove it? How? Submit her to a purity test. Elena, no. Philip, you can't! Our daughter will pass any test. Then it's decided. What did you expect, that no shame would come upon her? I will not stand by while my Princess is made to open in her legs in public. It seems you care more about preserving. Isabella's dignity than she does. Watch your tongue. It's a humiliation for Isabella, but it will serve our purpose. She will the fail the test. And so the wedding will be forfeit. Aah! My inquiry has been thorough. The only inconsistent story is yours. A stolen loaf of bread does not make me a murderer. Confess now. Make it easy. I will not. God knows the truth. And His truth shall set me free. You will talk, boy. You will confess. Aah! Please, sir! I swear, I know nothing! Last chance to talk. Please, no more! Enough. Stop this. Not until the boy confesses. I did it. I killed him. See? They boy's a murderer. And he'll hang at dawn. You. A man from Toulouse came for you. He killed Jesper! This man, was he alone? Yes. Does he want to kill you? Yes. I took something he believed belonged to his people. Is that what's in your box? Never mention that box again. Understand? It's just wolves. You don't need to worry about the wolves out there... as long as you tend to the ones in here. What do you mean? There are two wolves in each of us, a black wolf and a white wolf. The white wolf thrives on love and faith. The black wolf, on fear and hate. You have to know which wolf to feed and when. We should go to sleep. I'll take you back in the morning. Good morning. May we warm our hands at your fire? We? Mother Superior and I. One thing I will not abide is when you people presume to make the sign of the cross. Do you know who I am? You're Malraux, a Cathar who's lost his way, a killer amongst men of peace. It's intriguing, isn't it? A Cathar who kills has lost his way. A Templar who kills is closer to God. Well, to business. Hand over the Grail. Believe me, I would sooner die than give you the Grail. It pains me to harm a child. Hand it over for me and your lad. Where is it? He's not my lad. He's just an orphan. He means nothing to me. It's in the tree! Landry! Aah! Run, boy. Run! There's nowhere to run! I'll find you, boy, and... Aah! Left. Turn left. But the ruins are this way. We're not going to the ruins. Roland! He paid me to bring you here. I needed the money. I'm sorry. He wants to kill you. Like you said, you're the only one who's seen his face. He's the one that's gonna die today. Look. There's too many of them. You'll die, Parsifal. What was her name, your girl? Marie. If I would Marie, I wouldn't want the man I loved to throw his life away. Here. Why did you warn me? I don't know. Let's go before he sees us. Please, sir. I don't want to die. You won't. I know you didn't murder the Saracan. But you saw someone leaving the room. Didn't you? Yes. Who did you see? How long were you going to let the boy suffer? You knew all along? No. I gambled the real culprit would run in and stop it. But I never imagined it would be you. Why, Brother? The Saracen could've led us to the Grail. I believed his warning. The Grail... will destroy us all. You cannot believe in light, but not in dark... in Heaven, but not in Hell. Look at the pain the Grail has already caused... Godfrey's death, and all the bloodshed since. If God wanted men to possess the Grail, He wouldn't keep taking it from us. It's not God who takes it from us. It's men... weak men. Men like you. Brother Tancrede, you stand charged with murder. You will be held under lock and key until the Master returns. I'm coming, boy! Run, boy! Boy? Listen close, lad! You can't outrun me! Nobody's gonna save you out here. So just let me come to you. Get up, boy. Come here, lad. I cannot lie. It will hurt. - But then you will be free. Lord... - Please. No. For the sin I'm about to commit... Boy, bring me the box. You're safe now. Landry? You think he came back for you, boy? He didn't come for you! He came for the Grail! Let's go. Squire. If anybody found out, there'd be a scandal. It will be a secret between us. I will not tell it to a soul. I will not tell to a soul, either. Don't make me do this. Courage. You are the Princess of France. No one can take that from you. - Who are they? - Quiet. Wait. What is he saying? He who discovers his own self discovers God. What does it mean? It means you have met the Brotherhood of Light. My lady, take a deep breath. It's done. Her Royal Grace is... virgo intacta. Satisfied? I am pleased to resume the union between outween our two familiea. Cousin. And let there be no more mention of my lands in Navarre. Your Grace, one more thing. Never, ever malign my daughter again. You cousin will have the valet post he wants under Charles de Vallois. - Thank you, Your Grace. - Thank you. Forgive me, but your Grace looks pale. In your condition, be sure to eat well. My condition? I'm afraid you're mistaken. Your Grace, I have midwifed hundreds of children. You are with child. This cannot be. I'm still with child! Your Grace... How is this possible? I'm sorry. I changed it, the medicine. I didn't want you blinded, or worse. It was my decision to make! I thought you would regret it. My sister regrets it every day of her life! I'm sorry. I'll fetch another vial of worm fern. No, no. I did not save one child today only to lose another. There is a way to resolve this. What happened? Who did this? This is your fault. Roland. You didn't deliver the boy. Where is he? Gone. But he hasn't finished with you. Adelina! Wait! Joan. Philip. What do you know of this Brotherhood of Light? I wasn't sure they really existed. On the Silk Road, there are stories of this secret group who are subject to no master, who emerge from nowhere, kill silently and without warning, then disappear into the wind. Their credo you were repeating. They call on one another by leaving out a simple orange. My master was called by a simple orange. What business would such men have with your master? I don't know. But I need to find out. He said he wouldn't tell. LLuis. It was a secret between me and him. Then... it is true? How could he do this to me? I feel so foolish. I was humiliated today in front of everybody. I am truly sorry. I can't marry him now. The wedding is nearly upon us. You can do something. If I knew the answer, believe me... Surely, there must be a way. You're clever, Uncle. Aren't there things you can do... things that nobody knows about? Isabella, what are you saying? I'm not saying anything. What is it? There's something you need to see, my Lord. It's urgent. It's from the King of England... Our gift, returned. Isabella. Isabella, don't look. Sebastian? What does this mean, my Lord? It means war.
