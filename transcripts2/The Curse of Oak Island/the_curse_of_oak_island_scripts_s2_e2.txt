 previously on the curse of Oak Island the hell is that it's a Spanish maravedi there is some sort of date 1652 we have an indication that we have a hard target we can't get in there and dig it rent a friggin block you won't believe this bill becomes law the province would call dibs on some discoveries made it okay so this could also impact your permits so the meantime let's go and do a little exploration at the money pit there is an

 island in the North Atlantic where men have been looking for treasure for more than 200 years so far they have uncovered tunnels booby-traps carved stones with strange symbols even a 17th century pirate treasure coin six men have even lost their lives trying to solve the mystery according to legend one more will have to die before the treasure can be found Subtitled by Diego Moraes www.oakisland.tk you know people the deeper they get before they hit a boulder better it's a tubers I'm where

 one starts bouncing England bubbles long he's going down it's going down solitaire brothers Rick and Marty lagina are about to take on oak islands most difficult and potentially costly challenge they've decided to locate and hopefully excavate the world's most notorious treasure vault the money pit that is if they can find it we're trying to find a clue that leads us to the actual money pit so we're gonna drill it we're gonna core it we're gonna have a look and see if we can get some evidence since its discovery in 1795 the money pit has been thought to be a hiding place for everything from pirate treasure to the Ark of the Covenant and even the Holy Grail it is protected by booby traps and a curse that warns seven men must die in pursuit of the treasure before it can be found for the laginas and their partners finding the money pit will literally be like looking for a needle in a haystack although they know the general location of the original treasure shaft centuries of digging drilling and even dynamiting have left the precise spot virtually lost to time for this reason they will have to drill a series of test holes using a rig designed for this very purpose first after reaching a target depth of approximately 140 feet a steel casing will be inserted into the hole to keep it from collapsing then a two-foot-long hollow coring bit will extract a sample of earth and any other objects present if the coin bit can retrieve any wood planking or other artifacts that can be dated to before 1795 then the laginas and their team will have found the money pit this is kind of a bad sign what the hell is the deal hey guys why the quiet we hit something down there yeah girls steal in advance yeah no fun for about 20 minutes on it and it didn't budge Oh deep are you that's 53 feet from that grade right there and it was good rolling and then it just stopped there really isn't a decision here right you got to come on I can't advance I mean that was 25 minutes there and it didn't budge so yeah okay yeah typical of Oak Island experience it started off great we think we have the perfect spot and then 53 feet bit plugs up don't know what the problem is typical Oak Island why do people think that what lies buried on Oak Island can be found at a depth of 140 feet in 1804 Daniel McInnis one of the three young men who had discovered the monk pit nine years earlier was a part of the search team that was able to reach a depth of 90 feet when they suddenly encountered a strange flat stone embedded in oak planking upon removing it they noticed that the stone was etched with an elaborate series of shapes and symbols suddenly the 90-foot shaft began to fill with seawater as if some kind of booby trap had been sprung efforts to continue digging ground to a halt and the search for treasure on Oak Island was abandoned at least for a while in the mid 1800s area college professor James Lee sh-t is reported to have used a simple deciphering system to translate the markings found on the mysterious stone slab it read forty feet below two million pounds are buried but if translating the stone was relatively easy reaching the bottom of the shaft has so far proved to be impossible she was chewing on something only that phone that oh there you go I think you hit some wood and she's back in your production area complicating Rick and Marty's efforts to find the location of the original money pit is the enormous amount of debris left behind by generations of Past treasure hunters all had tried to reach the underground treasure vault by digging a number of wooden shafts and tunnels in hopes of avoiding the booby traps it didn't work there are 44 shafts dug in around this area all those were backfilled and you can picture the nails and the wood and the detritus from people digging so really it was sort of predictable we'd have trouble yeah there we go that's what got you you know I think it's a combination of granite and wood in between the two of them to come you up would it be exciting that we hit wood it would be if we knew who were in the original Money pit shaft yes I think we give her another fight ironically even if the laginas and their partners do successfully locate the original money pit there's still no guarantee that anything of value actually lies buried there ever since the money pit was first discovered in 1795 only a 17th century Spanish coin fragments of what appeared to be a gold chain a tiny piece of paper and a few antique tools have ever been documented as being found at or near the so-called treasure site broke Island has always been a financial risk/reward problem if we knew there was a dollar and the money it would we risk 50 cents to go get it yes but we don't know there's a dollar in the money pit so why have the laginas and their partners spent millions of dollars chasing a dream and why are they willing to risk millions more to excavate the original money pit in 1897 at a depth of approximately 140 feet a team of men drilling at the site found evidence of what appeared to be a cement-covered vault and in it is something described as loose metal pieces could this have been the actual treasure vault the one which according to the coded message was filled with two million pounds worth of gold unfortunately the treasure hunters never did find out while drilling another hole seawater once again flooded the shaft and from that point on reaching the mysterious concrete vault and avoiding the booby traps has been long thought to be impossible she could take a walk Upton but now it is the laginas turn and they-- and their partners-- are determined to succeed do you understand the meaning of that movie Carrie [Music] coming up you hit a lot of this there's no way of pulling your foot we have a film not many people have seen we're looking for a simple an eight-sided star see that there [Music] okay that's exact same spot jack stain Rick Marty and their partner craig tester find themselves at a standstill while trying to locate the original Oak Island money pit the drill is stopped at 53 feet unable to advance through the more than 200 years of debris left behind by past searches Dan's coming out you want to go talk to him sure what he thinks yeah dan Blankenship has been living on Oak Island and searching for its treasure for nearly half a century yeah he is perhaps the only man in the world who knows every inch of this 140-acre landmass both above ground and below love the wood yeah that's what's coming up from the core of the Chappell shaft I did you smell it of all the abandoned treasure shafts dug since 1795 only two are believed to have come closest to reaching the original money pit the Chappell shaft dug in 1931 and the Hedden shaft dug in 1937 if the team has excessively located one of these long-abandoned shafts it means they could be very close to finding the original money pit shaft for Chappell shaft that's spruce and that's what Chappell who was using was spruce a lot of this there's no way of going through it in my opinion you're not gonna get nothing there that's for sure as soon as I saw where he was drilling I mean I thought they were gonna put the hole in the northwest corner if you want to try and get in between the Chappell shaft and the Hedden shaft I would move back maybe four feet and that way at least six feet well then I say we need you go with his experience rather than our calculations yeah [Applause] about time we brought the brains out here as far as Dan's participation and all this we're fools really not to engage with him at every step because he has almost 50 years of experience and sometimes we get sold off focus that we go to books we go to archival information we've got a living archive rating pharmacist and sometimes we just plain forget with Dan Blankenship's help the team chooses its next drill site but it is not without risk hitting rocks metal objects or other buried debris could severely damage their drilling equipment and force a setback both in time and money okay here we go again welcome to okay ever while drilling continues in the area of the money pit Rick Marty and the team assemble in what they call the war room they are meeting with Paul Troutman whose father James had worked alongside dan Blankenship in the mid-1960s their importer was one of the most determined of all the Oak Island treasure hunters Robert Dunfield so your father was a partner in the deal my dad was here in 1965 and he met you as well as Robert Dunfield as one-third partner in exploring Oak Island how did you father get interested in the island how he became interested was through an article which most people have senior digest yeah Reader's Digest Dan remembers that this article is amazing because it is tied you my father and you as well as Dunfield all to the islands on January 29th 1965 a few weeks after the publication of the article about Oak Island in The Reader's Digest treasure hunter Robert Restall published an article in the Hamilton Ontario spectator entitled the riddle of Oak Island the 59 year old motorcycle daredevil indicated that he was just weeks away from solving the Oak Island mystery the article attracted the attention of robert dunfield a california geologist who was eager to invest $5,000 in restall's activities but on August 17th tragedy struck when Robert rest all along with his son and two others died after being overcome by toxic h2s gas emanating from a treasure shaft not willing to lose his investment Robert Dunfield quickly took over the Restall contract and during the next year oversaw an aggressive series of drillings and excavations we have a film that my dad took in 1965 I'd like to show this to you not many people have seen this film okay oh it's in color yes it is a color film where are we right here we're near the money pit you can already see some of the destruction that happens dirt being moved around everywhere Robert dunfield's approach to getting to the bottom of the money pit would prove to be the most controversial in the islands history he bulldozed Smith's Cove trying to cover the flood entrances he dug the money pit out to 100 feet wide and more than 100 feet deep in process many of oak islands landmarks along with what are now believed to be precious clues were destroyed watching Paul Chapman's movie of his father's time on Oak Island you're watching history come alive it looks radically different than it looks right now Robert dunfield's strategy not only proved to be destructive it was also hugely unsuccessful on January 1st 1966 the massive hole dug at the site of the money pit collapsed due to flooding after running out of both money and time the geologists turned treasure hunter left the island in April 1966 never to return I should tell you this here your dad would substantiate it Dunfield made a hell of a lot more enemies that he made friends yes he did I get it I can just see the mentality it would be I'm going to find it doing this so none of this stuff matters well then he didn't find it in the clues mattered but they were gone yeah exactly yeah everybody who's had possession of this island moves the throne he just came in on a massive scale I don't think there's any blame being associated just doesn't make our job and easier meeting with Paul Troutman and seeing his father's incredible home movies has helped validate many of the stories Rick and Marty have heard about Oak Island this is my father and he's actually going to be pointing at something which is kind of interesting something that they had uncovered here which you'll see here in a minute that little piece of wood that you're if your dad took a picture over the one Valley he did it for a reason I know he did and he stood in front of the camera at the point where it was there pointing to things that we no longer have access to they were holding in their hands a wooden piece of a structure that had dovetails on both ends that looked like it had numerals engraved in it what was it what was it used for where was it found at what deaths so much information lost coming up it's been spinning and it's just not proceeding it's not advancing when he's stopping the drilling you think it's a new day on Oak Island and at the money pit area Rick lagina and Craig tester are still trying to locate the original 18th century treasure shaft right hey did the new bid arrive we got her this morning yeah sit on the end there today they're planning to use a stronger drill bed one designed to cut through layers of rocky soil roots and other debris as one of Rick and Marty's business partners Craig tester brings to the island decades of experience as an engineer in the energy business I think this will run through it without any problem I'm more concerned about being able advance that casing any further I can strictly put down my smaller stuff okay he is known to be highly successful at finding and retrieving valuable minerals and other substances deep underground but even for him Oak Island represents a daunting challenge we're drilling down to try to find a part of the original money pit we don't know exactly where it's at because over the years there's been multiple shafts and they caved in on each other that's very frustrating hopefully this new bit will lead the way and we can get down to the one hundred and thirty five hundred and forty foot level and start bringing up samples blood samples these sounds bring up some gold we get thirty more feet we should be in somewhat virgin ground and then we won't be dealing with these obstructions ultimately what we want to see is the vault or something man-made below 135 feet meanwhile at new by Smith's Cove Rick and Marty's nephew Peter Fornetti along with veteran Oak Island treasure hunter dan henskee join author and metal detector expert Gary Drayton for a day of looking for potentially significant artifacts that's either my finger we'll try this rocky area okay a professional treasure hunter for more than 20 years Gary Drayton has been invited to Oak Island to search for evidence of human activity that predates the discovery of the money pit in 1795 that's a live signal using the CTX 3030 metal detector which can discriminate between ferrous and non-ferrous metals Gary will try to identify not only metal artifacts but who would have brought them here and what those persons might have been doing on Oak Island in the first place Gary is an impeccable hunter of coins he's highly respected in that field and he's provided results I'll be getting close there's an old saying that treasure runs from the Seekers maybe these Queens travel a bit as well I like detecting the waters edge yeah that's a good signal well Sabu so looks like an old button as well yeah seen this done Wow yeah that's an old book no about I can imagine that on a uniform maybe of soldiers uniform that's a flatboat that's one two seventeen hundred's you know an old military button but what kind some have speculated that the money pet was actually constructed in the late 1600s by the English captain Sir William Fitz to hide a vast cache of gold silver and Chinese porcelain from the wreck of the Spanish treasure ship to concepción are you gonna keep hold of that yeah keep it's antastic oh sweet hey Ryan good news right not the news that I like to carry it's been spinning and it's just an operating it's not advancing in how deep did you get with the casein 105 feet as the day wears on Rick lagina and Craig tester have still not been able to get a drill bit to reach the desired depth of 140 feet every hole they drill cost thousands of dollars and if they don't make progress soon they may be forced to abandon the project altogether please please tell me some good news Craig the Sun is out it's not raining that's good news okay and we're out of good news after that you got a core no no oh you mean no casing hung up at 105 what is stopping the drilling you think it's debris mixed debris if I had to diagnose the problem I'd say this rig doesn't have enough pump for rubble the only thing it can be you know I get a junk over the hole and that's not your fault it's just not enough pump that little coring rig is designed for a specific application and if you don't remove the material you're grinding up you can't make progress now you're just mulching it and REE mulch it I think that's what was happening Craig we are not gonna give up in our own field of expertise I mean I understand you get you guys aren't gonna make it with this rig but goldang it lets get a bigger rig in here I'm getting tired of this island kicker but you know what let's bring in the horsepower and do it I'm getting irritated although they are just 35 feet short of reaching their target death Rick and Marty are forced to suspend the day's operation the drill rig they're using is just not powerful enough to cut through nearly two centuries of rock rotted wood and man-made debris a new one will have to be brought in but that could cause a delay of several days once again Oak Island has claimed a temporary victory over those who would dare to discover its most highly guarded secrets oh I'd say I'm discouraged here today the old saying you know sometimes you eat the bear sometimes the bear eats you I'm feeling sort of like bear poop today but we're not gonna give up we're gonna keep after this thing coming up second say oh we have located a symbol that directly connects King Solomon's this is an interesting area Wien tribe that yeah sure leaving Smith's Cove peter fornetti dan henskee and gary drayton continue their search for evidence in a wooded area just a stone's throw from the money pit site and a good feeling about is because it's close to the money pit if anyone's gonna be working on the money pit I'm sure they're gonna be camped out in this area if Gary's hunch is correct then the team may be able to find a connection between the items found at the site and the people who dug elaborate shaft more than two hundred years ago Oh I like that sound yeah what I'll do is I'll cut a plug and then make it easier one very deep on the gays oh well I think I can see it Oh oh wow that's crazy looks a lot like penny-size doesn't it yeah that's probably it's just some little squiggly it's not a perfect circle which is good it might be a Ameri VV hmm it's the size of a two maravedi yeah that's a beauty it's an old Spanish poplar coin if Gary Drayton is correct the unearthing of another 17th century Spanish coin would be a huge discovery not only would it add even more convincing evidence that Spanish explorers did in fact visit Oak Island in the 1600s it would suggest that what lies at the bottom of the Oak Island money pit may very well be a pirate treasure so gentlemen you are the treasure force guys right welcome to Oak Island after a long day of work and exploration Marty and Rick lagina gather their team at the fo'c'sle Tavern in nearby Chester to review the day's findings and joining them are professional treasure hunters J Hutton Pulitzer and his cousin Aubrey Raiford they have been invited to share what they claim is evidence of yet another incredible theory the world's longest treasure hunt you're not part of it and of course you've heard about the seven guys right they told you about that didn't it we drew strong you guys are in the same business we are but you bring some stuff that maybe we don't have one of things we've got Gary working on is is doing he's a you know world-class metal detector he can run that gizmo over stuff and decide whether it's nails or something better so he's been scouring the island didn't yeah we've had a pretty good stuff in fact amazing start for the first day we walk into the woods and the first signal was this it's probably a two maravedi Wow yeah I find that actually super significant because we were wondering about the first one but now you have to I mean you have to start thinking yeah II need can we clean it up give it yeah we get a date I'll call ya and you can see the symbols typical symbols and some Roman numerals then on the other side just normally a crown Wow you said you're here for several days right yeah I'm expecting more so you're sure that some of the things you found predate the beginning of the treasure hunt itself yes we have located a symbol and Nova Scotia that we believe a hundred percent has to do with al-qaeda more importantly this symbol directly connects to the transportation of what would have been coming out of King Solomon's Temple when it was sacked King Solomon's Temple the original Hebrew temple built in Jerusalem nearly 3,000 years ago which housed a golden chest called the Ark of the Covenant that contained the original Ten Commandments according to most scholars the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar invaded Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple of Solomon sometime around 597 BC but if as Hutton Pulitzer suggests precious objects from the temple were rescued as early as the fifth century BC who could have done it and how did these objects find their way to a remote island in the North Atlantic I'm going to show you a symbol that uniquely ties back to the Holy Land if the symbol is correct along with this symbol will be a language that should not exist in stone writing in Nova Scotia and it directly ties to the island that would be very exciting something historically significant in a big way we want to unravel this thing we want unravel this mystery so let's move forward let's figure it out here's the figure you know Cheers their treasure coming up we're looking for a symbol about the size of a dinner plate see that there that's what we're looking for there's the connection and why we think this is important to Oak Island as they wait for a new drill rig to arrive Rick Marty and their partner Craig tester have agreed to take a brief trip off-island with J Hutton Pulitzer and his cousin Aubrey Raiford they are going to look at physical evidence that supports Pulitzers incredible theory that what lies on Oak Island may very well connect to the legendary treasures of King Solomon's Temple we've heard rumors of a particular glyph carved in stone that's right here not too far from Oak Island now you know that the native people here in Nineveh they consider their most ancient symbol which they say this is the symbol for people in 1983 strange stone carvings or petroglyphs were discovered at a rock outcropping in the area known as the Bedford Barrens some 40 miles northeast of Oak Island on land claimed by the native Mi'kmaq tribes people as the first known native inhabitants of North America's northeastern region the Mi'kmaq people had their first recorded contact with Europeans in the 15th century but recent evidence suggests that significant contact with them may have occurred hundreds and perhaps thousands of years earlier I think we're gonna be able to tell you the who the when and the where and because of what we have we have a very strong indication as to the what geez Rick that's your big speech right there all the time the the what the where the when the why the why and the how of what happened on Oak Island that's what drives me that's only you reason ascribe news cases we'll need the laptop from the black case with the silver scanner in it what do you have to do we're gonna take full spectrum photography of it and then we're gonna lift it off the rocks in 3d and model it if our understanding and research is right we're all gonna be collectively looking for us a symbol that should be about the size of a dinner plate okay let's go I try and go into everything with an open mind obviously Hutton has done an enormous amount of research on the island so I went into the sort of little quest with an open mind you want to believe but no khylin it's not that easy of a nut to crack pardon the pun you know it's a pretty tough ACORN and I don't know that he has all the answers at least not yet there's something here okay okay okay give me the space gang hang on see that there you know that's what we're looking for okay you can definitely deal it's irregular man are you serious look at that nothing like that I don't really know I've not seen anything if we're right and this is what we believe it is and if it's tied to the people we believe it is I can connect every single dot here for you so Isaiah pentagram looks like a pentagram well we've got one two three four five six seven eight points surrounded Center gather me some water real quick can you give that a pump or two there mr. tester let's go spring it lightly all the way around wet it down see how it starts to reveal there you go so you've got one two three four one two three four the nickimja in their culture they claim this is their oldest petroglyph but it's interesting because this eight-sided Star comes from what used to be part of the Holy Land that's quite significant this eight-sided Star comes from what used to be part of the Holy Land author and professional treasure hunter J Hutton Pulitzer has just shown Marty and Rick a strange rock carving of an eight-pointed star although it is believed to predate the indigenous Mi'kmaq people by centuries the design has also been found at various ancient sites throughout the Middle East but if this unique symbol wasn't carved by a member of the MiG Monde nation who carved it and how long ago this is distinctly an ancient Biblical land symbol here's what's really interesting you've got cross cross cross cross cross cross see it yeah what would make me impressed is that this wasn't carved by somebody fifty years ago no sir but we have to know that yes yeah okay here's what I'm gonna do I want to scan this and show you it in 3d let's get one here what about maybe one here the 3d scanner works by projecting a coded light pattern onto the petroglyph which conforms to every groove and marking in the rock it then scans the pattern like a barcode creating a real-time 3d model of the scanned surface on a computer screen so what I'm doing here is this is actually scanning the rock face we're basically painting the rock botton has the most interesting gizmos what a great thing to be able to scan an inscription and then turn it to the inverse and flip it around and manipulate it here's what we think this particular glyph is important to oak island now think of the stone at 90 feet C's boxes dots angles the symbology or the language on the stone at 90 feet matches the origins of the eight-sided star all right look if the symbols really are from an ancient language and that's verifiable he has to be a monumental coincidence that somebody just picked them at random I can't believe that could it be that the inscription on the mysterious stone slab wasn't encode at all but in an ancient language as J Hutton Pulitzer is suggesting and could that language when translated connect Oak Island to the lost treasures of the temple of King Solomon perhaps even the Ark of the Covenant Rick impressed not impressed they're just going to the petroglyphs with Hutton was pretty impressive our whole deal since we first came here was look we don't know everything you know new research new involvement new ideas always welcome we've got a few more things we want to wrap up send the data we collected today let's send it back to our research team let's correlate it and then let me just present it to you in a linear fashion point by point by point and we'll connect the dots for me I love that idea let's do it let's go he is kind of a mix of me and Rick and me certainly got Rick's passion and belief no he's he's just convinced as Rick is that there's something historically significant here and I guess he's like me in the sense that he wants to make sure we apply all the science we can this week Rick Marty and the other members of their team believe they have made good progress in just the past few days they found what they believe to be another 17th century Spanish coin one that might validate ancient legends about pirates burying treasure on the island they also have just seen an ancient carving one that could connect Oak Island to the lost treasures of King Solomon's Temple possibly even the Ark of the Covenant and regardless of the setbacks the team is still determined to locate and investigate the islands most carefully guarded secret the money pit but when they find it will it contain precious religious objects 17th century pirate treasure or will it be something even more extraordinary for now they are content with simply solving the mystery and avoiding the curse that is so far claimed six lives next time on the curse of Oak Island we're talking about a voyage traveling from the Holy Land to Nova Scotia Oh year 596 BC we need to get down to the money pit this rig will get down on it there are inherent dangers this is a British coin a 1770 wall bring us back tomorrow that's a gold baby you never rewrite history Subtitled by
