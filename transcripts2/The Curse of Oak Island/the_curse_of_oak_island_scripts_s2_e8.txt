 Tonight on the curse of Oak Island here's where we're gonna start I am just so sick of this swamp something right there you just got a reading he's saying we got multiple hits in the same area you got some divers coming in and we'll concentrate on 10x you ready to go let's do this what's in the bottom of 10x we're getting into analysis paralysis I am wanting to quit what do you mean you want to quit

 there is an island in the North Atlantic where men have been looking for treasure for more than 200 years so far they've uncovered booby-trapped flood tunnels carved stones with strange symbols 17th century Spanish coins and evidence of a wooden vault covered in concrete six men have even lost their lives trying to solve the mystery according to legend one more will have to die before the treasure can be found well that's forward mud should I get repositioned try Rick see what happens for the second year in a

 row brothers Rick and Marty lagina are attempting to drain the islands mysterious pyramid-shaped swamp it is here many Oak Island theorists believe the 200 year old mystery will be solved once and for all it's going to be swamp 2 the sequel Rick here has a drained and I would like to be able to at the end of the season either cross the swamp off or say no there's something to excavate here the difference between this year and last year of course is we have very specific sites we want to investigate with some fairly sophisticated equipment something a lot like last year yay finally the troops arrived to confirm the locations of the various target sites Craig tester has hired Pat Campbell and Matt Savelle from Canadian seabed research limited a geophysical company that specializes in the detection of underground structures and man-made objects they will be using a ground penetrating radar device the mala rough terrain antenna system that sends electromagnetic pulses through the earth to detect structures objects and voids up to 30 feet below the surface this whole investigation is coming down to using ground-penetrating radar we didn't use that last year we use metal detection equipment and if there are structures of significance and they go on deeper the metal detecting equipment would have completely missed a stone structure or even a wooden structure okay so Greg really you should take the lead and explain what the you know GPR GPS is doing this is the conductivity survey the m31 that ran on the ice and right along here we have a number of different anomalies and so we're gonna run right parallel to the shore going along here we think it's a good area and then we should get a better idea if it's something natural if there's if there's a stone walkway or something there yeah okay let's go well Marty and Matt Savelle head over to the money pit Craig tester Rick lagina and Pat Campbell begins scanning the southeastern area of the swamp where this past winter the team received indications that non-ferrous or precious metal objects may lie below you see anything at all there's some odd stuff going on definitely we can see where the flat rocks are it doesn't say vault here doesn't say that now oh that's too bad something's happening kargh is there anything on there see that right there looks like it's where the those rocks were there's something odd that this looks like it's flat across there a flat surface and right where the team detected possible precious metals this past winter right in here you start to see these dipping reflectors this way but there's also a reflector just cutting across there which is if this was the bottom of the swamp then you would wouldn't see this one going right through it right could this be the so-called mystery box that treasure hunter Bobby Restall searched for back in the 1960s or could it be something else like the entrance to a vast underground treasure vault although it will take further processing of the data to be able to tell what the large flat object might be Pat and Craig are finding it difficult to contain their excitement well imagine that if the object in the swamp turns out to be man-made you're good yeah and more than 200 years old then they may have just had another important breakthrough in solving the Oak Island mystery okay here we are at the money pit Marty and GPS expert Matt Savelle head over to the spot where the team located evidence of the mysterious wooden vault first discovered and then lost in 1897 they are here to get a precise geographic location of the drill hole using satellite-based Global Positioning technology right over there we just drilled the well and we think may have gone into one of the original chambers okay so that's what I want you to site because here's the plan we're gonna get that for a reference point yeah and we're going to then go due west because we have a theory that we find somewhat credible at least worth searching during their recent fact-finding trip to Scotland Rick Marty and their partners met with researchers Kathleen McGowan and Alan Butler who believe that the swamp hides the entrance to a sacred chamber that links directly to the money pit if it's ever possible to say that x marks the spot what you're looking for is 996 feet due west of the money pit the prophecies about the New Jerusalem say that the New Jerusalem will be built on an island of swamp according to McGowan and Butler the Oak Island money pit was constructed by Freemasons sometime in the 15th century and was intended to be an exact copy of what they call the Enochian chambers the ancient treasure vaults found deep beneath the temple of King Solomon as the chambers were originally designed to conceal objects of great importance McGowan and Butler believe the Freemasons built the money pit to hide the sacred religious treasures of the Knights Templar they also believe that if this theory is correct there would need to be a tenth chamber one built according to strict measurements and located exactly 996 feet due west of the money pit on the edge of the Oak Island swamp so you get me a reading right there and then we're gonna go find 996 due west and we'll run the GPR there yeah or we'll dig okay right here all right see if we get as level as possible how does that mess you up cause it's too high no we're good I can see it all right all right that's it good easy yeah precision yeah good head back that way yep excellent coming out well right now it's so good to even try to flank this just gonna sink down I'm getting a little discouraged plug the swamp do you really want to keep going we're gonna name this points we're on the name for it yet this is the Enochian chamber Enochian channel Qian chamber cancer we're gonna have it or hard look at this Enochian chamber i buy it enough to look i mean why not what do you got but another 40 to 50 meters north 16 meters west getting pretty close so yeah I'd say right there that's it yeah does it feel like you're standing on something important I hope I hope if Marty can verify the existence of an underground chamber or tunnel under the swamp it may serve not only as an incredible archaeological find but a shortcut directly into the money pit we're gonna at least run GPR here you should pick it up right yeah if there's a chamber under here you should pick it up he's gotta get it out here yeah it was easy be gone by now yeah okay so now I bring in the real muscle okay big brother Rick nothing he loves better than an x marks the spot while Marty and Matt Savelle double checked their GPS data at the western edge of the swamp Rick lagina Charles Barkhouse and Jack Begley decide to check out another key area of the swamp known as the mercy point yes my brother would say oh no the swamp the point is located near the apex of the triangular-shaped swamp on the spot Norwegian researcher Petter Amundsen identified as corresponding to one of the points on the so called Tree of Life based on Clues believed to be embedded in the first printed volume of William Shakespeare's collected works the mercy point is thought to mark the location of a vast underground treasure vault which like the Enochian chamber contains sacred treasures from King Solomon's Temple it was also here where last summer Rick Marty and the team found the 17th century Spanish pirate coin get excited you need to immerse yourself in this project right away jack go for where are we placing them no we're going now I got a bit of dick handout guys when conducting a preliminary investigation of the mercy point area earlier this year diver Tony Sampson found a large flat stone slab below the murky brackish water his three feet by two feet further could it have been the entrance to a hidden underground tunnel perhaps the same one marty was looking for earlier if there really is a vault or some type of underground structure buried in the swamp Rick lagina is hoping that ground-penetrating radar can confirm it once and for all there's a lot of water back here is that good news nope to do so would require getting the mercy point area of the swamp drained enough so that a plywood walkway can be set up for the GPR unit all right now it's no good even trying to plank this because it's too soupy it's just gonna sink down low and take a look see what I mean cuz right now you put plywood on that you're just gonna sink down that wasn't smart does that feel okay there's our answer so you're right I mean that's not gonna work nope even though multiple pumps have been running for several days the mercy point area refuses to drain here's a plan we'll take the little submersible it's got a hundred feet on it okay put it in here and take the Blue Hose for the discharge once again just as it did last summer the swamp is filling up as fast as the pumps can drain it the island it seems is determined to protect its secrets but Rick lagina is just as determined and for him giving up or giving in is never an option yeah we gonna put me some slack draining the backside of the swamp didn't go well we dealt with that issue last year we'll deal with it again my brother's not gonna be too happy because he does is an intense dislike of the swamp but look at the end of the day it's not going to deter us okay plug I want to continue I want to figure out once and for all is there something in the swamp that's what I want to do that's what we're going to do we see how it goes coming up something right there he said we got multiple hits in the same area three and a half meters from the center of the antenna that's exactly where it should be it's gonna be a tough slog going out there you want to walk along the edge first just take that right there right by those rocks just go right across those rocks after gathering GPR data at the area known as the mercy point where are you taking me Rick lagina and Craig tester along with GPR expert Pat Campbell join Marty lagina to see if Alan Butler and Kathleen McGowan's theory about a so-called Enochian chamber located 996 feet west of the money pit is correct okay right here's where we're gonna start all right that's the spot you phoned right yes right Oh bye Craig that is it I put that stake in myself I don't know how many different people are adamant there's something buried in the swamp a lot of them do research and connect dots I want an ah-ha moment okay all right let's try you ready Pat yeah go just put these lines in the worst possible what we've always wanted to do what you want to do is cross things off yeah okay the swamp has never been explored to the extent we've currently done it and if it needs to be investigated yeah all right yeah it's a bad spot I'm not willing to walk away without trying everything one sec huh I'm not sure if that's where I stumbled right there huh nothing anything an anomaly but he didn't know if it was where he stumbled that's exactly where we went up no you don't know that I know over that hump is it it was yeah how do you know you don't know where he saw it you saw it between when he looked I'm just gauging by when he looked back okay but you know what let's not make stuff up let's do all the lines ooh this we do each one back and forth so if we do this one back and forth oh great [Music] stop there for a second something right there he's just some diffractions yeah he just got a reading he's saying right I want it when right here no back three and a half meters from the center of the antennas that's exactly where it should be a positive reading right where Rick and Marty were told they'd find the Enochian chamber it's amazing but it's right here with us down well that's good let's repeat it proofs in the repetition of it though although the initial readings are encouraging Rick and Marty have learned from experience that good news on Oak Island especially with regard to the swamp may be too good to be true suddenly same breed around there a second positive reading right between the two yeah okay close five meters multiple targets in the same area could it be the Enochian chamber I mean it's interesting right we got multiple hits in the same area that's never happened anywhere else what if there was a hollow chamber ten feet by ten feet by ten feet what would you see oh you would have seen a hyperbolic diffraction a big one yeah and we've not seen anything like that not not a big one now about these no we need to look at the data whatever it's probably the worst thing that could happen to us the worst thing but you know yeah it is the worst thing it's like duplication duplication we did we did got duplication and we've got a baseline here where we got no hits on two runs I mean if we had nothing there we can't put an X through anything read my lips I hate the swamp tired of the swamp and want to be in the swamp anymore but Rick had some very valid reasons for being in there last year and then again this year in your mind is this diggable I want to see the process dad I mean fine then a day and a half will have to make a decision I'm done there comes a point of diminishing returns and he's aware of it too it's just I think sometimes there has to be a reality check for Marty lagina if there really is an Oak Island curse then it is located right here at the Oak Island swamp for the past several months he and the team have gathered miles of data and conducted numerous tests and all have indicated the presence of something strange beneath the acres of dark brackish water but when the data is tested the results are often inconclusive or disappear altogether this is crazy you get a hit it goes away and you come up with nothing how's that possible this is a situation that has been a source of conflict between Marty and his brother and a situation that as far as Marty's concerned can't go on much longer here's the deal Rick I gotta ask you something okay down granted we don't have the GPR yet okay they does not invade us not in but I mean it can't help but I'm getting a little discouraged but too swamped okay yeah okay Oh hear me oh yeah I want to ask you this from my heart okay all right you're the guy that's carrying us all Rick sort of like Frodo in Lord of the Rings you know it you're the one who has to keep us all going you're the one who has to be the believer are you sure do you really want to keep going don't make it simple yes I'm still all in and I hope that we are all in marty is also concerned that just like last year time is running out and that the precious few weeks the team has left to spend on the island this summer would be better spent by exploring other potential treasure sites I wish this were the treasure path and it might yet be you know we've run two types of GPR and we've run the x6 let's go out here and we see all the targets at the point we're at right now give me your top four eyes show me where they know the top four are well this one for sure and then there was a hit there on those recessed areas you know the earthen berm and then we have mercy right there where the flags are waiting and then we have the new theory the Enochian chamber right out there and we have hits on each of these but inconclusive data on the of them right so far really of a confirming hit here confirming hit there and only one hit off of the GPR there and we have data we have data in the can which we've yet to receive you know basically Rick two years in a row we kind of did the same thing with slightly different devices and slightly different methods slightly different targets but you know I mean that's why I'm ready - I'm ready to say stop I am I am sick of the swamp and I am wanting to quit what do you mean you want to quit coming up this is not a simple dive guys the island is a killer well here's the deal Rick I am sick of the swamp and I am wanting to quit what do you mean you want to quit for much of this year brothers Rick and Marty lagina have had a serious difference of opinion regarding the Oak Island swamp Marty believes the team has been repeatedly excited by encouraging data and you definitely have something here with this non-ferrous target here only to have that data lead to yet another in a series of dead ends unfortunately there are only one or two ferrous metal objects we could see all the others are of no interest Rick lagina believes big spike here that not all of the data the team has been receiving can be wrong still spiking if anything he is more convinced than ever that the swamp may hold the key to the entire Oak Island mystery I want to confirm those two targets I do want to quit but only to this extent I don't want to run any more data we're getting into analysis paralysis if you want to keep going on this swamp let's dig something let's do it right and let's dig something and I'm gonna leave it to you and as far as I'm concerned where do you agree yeah I agree I used the Q word he hates Q word I say I want to quit I mean it's like I hit him with a two-by-four right I don't want to quit investigating I just want to quit with the remote sensing and and he was fine with that he's right I don't like the Q word it doesn't like the Q in anything we're not quitting no and we're a team so we're not quitting okay we're not quitting I I'm with it I am 100% with you okay fine we'll look at the data that's in you can day that's in the can we'll pick two sites let's do it let's dig it's time to dig with all questions given all right good now that Rick and Marty have agreed to refocus their efforts on exploring the money pit and the so-called Chappell vault they need to figure out a way to do it and avoid the flooding that is prevented digging any hole deeper than 140 feet for this reason Rick Dave Blankenship and Jack Begley have scheduled a meeting in the war room to talk with someone who is offered to help them so we've got your proposal and it reads very interesting during his visit to Oak Island earlier this year author and treasure hunter J Hutton Pulitzer shared his incredible theory that a priceless treasure was buried on Oak Island more than 2,500 years ago there is an ancient legend about an Ancient Mariner society traveling from the Holy Land to Nova Scotia with artifacts from the first temple what year are we talking we're talking about 582 to 596 BC now J Hutton Pulitzer has offered to help Rick Marty and their partners get to the bottom of the money pit to do this and avoid hitting the so-called booby-trapped flood tunnels he has offered to send two members of his team who are professional scuba divers they will attempt to go in through what is considered the money pits backdoor 10x it's an ambitious plan that is both difficult and dangerous we go down and we get into this hole we just started doing right so are you inspecting the whole hole we have to inspect the entire place nobody truly knows what's in there located 180 feet away from the money pit 10x was dug in the 1970s by dan Blankenship with the help of his son Dave and treasure hunter dan henskee it was dug in the hope that it would offer a way of getting to the money pit without encountering ocean water but at a depth of 60 feet 10x flooded #NOME? up deeper and deeper he and his team dug until in 1971 they reached a staggering depth of 235 feet I had always been in awe of the construction of 10x it's 18 stories straight down dug by hand by basically three people dan blankenship david blankenship and dan henskee you look at the equipment that surrounds that shaft and you realize how ingenious they had to be they macgyver'd that shaft really that's what they did it had to do with what they had on hand once at the bottom Dan discovered a large man-made chamber where he was in a video camera he believed he recorded images of ancient tools wooden posts treasure chests and even tunnels one of which appeared to go in the direction of the money pit but during one of his dives Dan was nearly killed when one of the steel casings collapsed from the enormous pressure diving down into 10x has rarely been attempted since we've got to be prepared and it has to be engineered and planned for the worst possible circumstances okay well on our end what do you need us to do we're gonna have to make sure somehow that we stabilize that metal holder so we're gonna have to build a platform can we simply build a deck yes so we're talking roughly a 12 by 12 if not probably bigger if not bigger and from the last time right as far as that safety issue is concerned with the ladder and the loose metal we intend to cut off the ladder but only to water level is that will that be sufficient for you that should be fine Hutton has expressed some of his needs in terms of what he requires but now we're bringing in a dive team putting people at risk it makes you take pause and think are we doing the right thing okay well you know we've got our marching orders and you've got a lot of planning and trial dives to do so let us get to work on our end you get to work on your and it we'll keep in touch thanks Hutton Kerr Rick and the team are now convinced that sending divers into 10x could be the key to solving the entire Oak Island mystery but what will they find ancient tools pirate treasure chests a secret tunnel leading to the money pit perhaps after more than 200 years Oak Island will finally be forced to divulge its secrets coming up you're ready to go let's do this what's in the bottom of it's a new day on Oak Island and with it comes a new plan and a new enthusiasm for solving a 200 year old mystery in preparation for next week's dive Rick lagina and Dave Blankenship along with Charles Barkhouse and Jack Begley are building a 12 foot square safety platform around 10x when completed it will serve as both a staging area and a monitoring center allowing the team to track the divers movements during every inch of their 235 foot descent we had some concerns for the divers in terms of water clarity I mean the dye is still in 10x of course it's in 10x when it should be in the ocean but it was and we need to flush it out so we need to get the dye to the point of dilution where it's not an issue anymore yeah it's still green because 10x is still filled with phosphorescent green water left over from the team's recent dye test it will need to be pumped out so that the divers will have maximum visibility here's what's on the agenda we'll put our blocks down and square it up make sure it's outfit custom four by fours and pin the corners no rectum once we get this Square and tacked together we raise it up we get this thing fairly level to begin what then we'll measure our full before okay you're the engineer on this job okay come on let's do this for the Oak Island team working at 10x is both an exciting and an emotional experience exciting because it represents progress the anticipation that the answers they have been looking for are only a few feet below and perhaps only a few days away okay Jack we put them to my friend there now but for Dave Blankenship who has spent the majority of his life living and working with his father on the island and who helped dig 10x the experience is bittersweet for him the 235-foot deep borehole represents a big part of his father's legacy finishing him and hopefully finding the treasure will assure him that his father's life as well as that of his mother was not lived in vain for David it's important he's articulated it before he wants to finish that shaft for his mother his mother spent many years here believed in Oak Island but at a cost sacrificed probably some of her interest her passions to Dan's wanting to solve the Oak Island mystery and David is passionately devoted to that cause he will see the end of 10x and we will do that is he pretty excited about this Doug was absolutely excited when he was building the dock he could it was one board after another come on let's get going you know he's committed to it he's gonna put three screws in it that's plenty I'm over-engineering you go nuts there just wait to bail now perfect yeah but what I hope the wooden deck is finished and all the preparations for the dive have been made except one Rick lagina and the team will need to find someone who will climb into 10x and clear away 40 years of rusted metal and crumbling debris from the inside I didn't think we'd get done did you yep you did I should listen to you more often you did give me too much grief so you coming pensee good good good good good we gonna put the tanks on the deck now would leave on the truck got 200 for the hoes try not to kink that all to hell in 1971 dan blankenship decided to widen 10-x to a diameter of 8 feet after digging by hand he and his team lined the upper portion of the two hundred and thirty-five foot shaft with steel casings made from hollowed-out railroad cars they also used concrete to reinforce the area from 90 feet to 181 feet unfortunately before he could widen then reinforce all of 10x Dan ran out of money and had to abandon the ambitious project Mon it has now been more than 20 years since anyone is doped down to the bottom of 10x and in that time the one sturdy steel and concrete-lined shaft has become rusted and full of debris we've got to get me down there in preparation for next week's dive Rick lagina will have to enter the eight-foot wide hole and clear away layers of crumbly metal and rotting timbers there's a ladder right there moving over to see it that's got to come out down the water level so we're gonna torch torch our way down should be about 40 feet the water so three or four pulls and we should be very good now it's still Kyle and things never go good hey Dave yep if it can go wrong it will go wrong rick is going to be lowered into 10x by means of a specially designed steel cage once inside he will use a blowtorch to cut away any loose steel that could potentially break away and injure the divers during their upcoming operation how much room you got we're right on the ladder going down a little bit Rick no we're on the ladder nope nope nope nope nope you got to go if it goes at all it's got to go like that we're good here almost like it was made for okay I don't want this stuff falling either we're gonna give you a hard hat in a minute tighten it up they're shot the inside of 10x is even more rusted than Rick previously thought he will need to do a lot more cutting with the blowtorch before the inside of the shaft could be considered safe there was a little bit of sadness because I hear I am deconstructing it to gain answers they constructed it to get the answers and Here I am taking it apart to find the answers they burn their heart when the red yellow ever since 1795 people have been trying and failing to get around the booby traps that are believed to surround the money getting a dive team to the bottom of 10x could finally prove that dan Blankenship was right all along he had found the back door into a vast underground treasure vault what do you want perhaps rick lagina's boyhood dream of helping to solve the Oak Island mystery right there really will come true after all or will it be like so many other things on Oak Island plagued by a curse little more okay a curse that could put yet another life next time on the curse of Oak Island for the first time somebody's gonna go down in 10x and actually go into the cavern what do you think is down at the bottom two chests and one body it's the first look we have infinite according to the legend seven people need to die and I'm not gonna be number seven we're not going to get somebody killed in that hole Recker I should go with Subtitled by Diego Moraes www.oakisland.tk
