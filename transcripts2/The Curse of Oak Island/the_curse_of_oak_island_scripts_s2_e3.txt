 previously on the curse of Oak Island this could be the first step towards getting the money finished you're not gonna get nothing there there's no way of going through footing and you won't believe this if the bill becomes law the province would call dibs on some discoveries made at Oak Island we have located a symbol that directly connects King Solomon's Temple to the island this eight-sided Star comes from

 the Holy Name that's significant there is an island in the North Atlantic where men have been looking for treasure for more than 200 years so far they've uncovered tunnels booby-traps carved stones with strange symbols even a 17th century pirate treasure coin six men have even lost their lives trying to solve the mystery and according to legend one more will have to die before the treasure  can be found Subtitled by Diego Moraes www.oakisland.tk it's a new day on Oak Island a day that will bring new equipment new

 theories and hopefully new findings Hutton Aubrey this is what we affectionately call our war room we'd like to think that we have our good ideas in here so welcome thank you it is also on this day that Rick Marty and their team have arranged the meet with professional treasure hunters J Hutton Pulitzer and his cousin Aubrey Raiford you're not part of it one week ago Hutton and Aubrey came to Oak Island armed with Hutton's theory that the Oak Island mystery involved nothing less than a treasure taken from King Solomon's Temple I'm gonna show you assemble that uniquely ties back to the Holy Land he then invited Marty Rick and members of the team to come with him off the island to see an ancient petroglyph of an eight-pointed star located on land claimed by the native big moth tribes people see that there that's quite significant according to his research Hutton claimed the symbol was based on an ancient language one connected to the symbols found on the mysterious stone slab that was discovered in the money pit in 1804 now the veteran treasure hunter has returned to Oak Island ready to present what he promises will be an incredible theory we appreciate the little field trip to the petroglyphs that was interesting and you've had us on the edge of our seats for a little bit of time now and I understand you're ready to show the rest of the deck here right this is about history in the bottom of this hole there's going to be some of the most important pieces of treasure to me and kind we're talking about the Ark of the Covenant the Ark of the Covenant the gold chest which according to the Old Testament contained the actual Ten Commandments although there is some debate about whether or not the ark actually existed many scholars believe that either did it was most likely destroyed along with everything else when the first temple of King Solomon was plundered by the Babylonians in approximately 600 BC here is what we believe there is an ancient legend about an Ancient Mariner society traveling from the Holy Land to Nova Scotia this particular society was able to navigate the world by tracking stars they were sailing with artifacts from the first temple what year are we talking we're talking about a voyage about 582 to 596 BC okay there's all these theories you know they kind of get more outlandish as you go now we're back to 500 BC 2500 years ago and I believer in it no not yet but am I willing to dismiss it no because you know he could be right keep going the story goes that they left the Holy Land they went to the north part of Africa they went to the Iberian Peninsula they come on up the coast of Ireland and Scotland and eventually to Nova Scotia but if as J Hutton Pulitzer believes the Ark of the Covenant and its contents were rescued more than 2,500 years ago who would have done it the Phoenicians are the people were talking about and they're thinking we gotta get this the hell out of here we gotta take it to the other end of the earth well you're sitting here at the other end of the earth in relation to those times clearly that's the thing that will change the history of mankind oh yeah if you could prove this voyage absolutely it changes everything because we have this Columbus centric and you were right legendary further skills as Mariners the Phoenicians were an ancient Semitic culture that dominated trade in the Mediterranean region from approximately 1200 to 550 BC their empire extended from the Middle East to Spain and there are some historians who believe their knowledge of the sea may have enabled them to sail all the way across the Atlantic Ocean get me here get you back here get me back here there's a trail a symbol trail now they stopped at five known locations in this trip this language that specifically this people write is found in all of the locations so you're looking at the language of the inscribed stone that was found at the 90-foot level according to Pew losers theory the symbols on the inscribed stone are similar to those found in an ancient alphabet known as tifinagh it is closely associated with the Punic language used by the people of Carthage a powerful Phoenician colony in North Africa dating back as early as 1000 BC so let's draw some other connections we tried to connect to one other things we used what we call the trail of coins Stone Age Iron Age Bronze Age was all defined by the finding of Clint's coins is the magic trail droppings that you pick up along the way the reference yes this particular coin was minted in that region 2,500 years ago every one of the stops along this sacred voyage they have found these coins this particular hoard was found about 50 miles from here in 1996 three ancient bronze coins were discovered in Nova Scotia not far from the site of the star petroglyph at Bedford Barrens according to experts the coins were thought to be Carthaginian in origin this particular culture that speaks this old language the Phoenicians their symbol is an eight-sided star the Mick mah original symbol that they've adopted for their nation is an eight-sided star can you at least see health and dot's connect as the first known native inhabitants of North America's northeastern region the Mi'kmaq people had their first recorded contact with Europeans in the 14th century but could the similarities between the eight-pointed star from the Carthaginian coin found in Nova Scotia the eight-pointed star found in the petroglyph in Bedford Barrens and the one used is a symbol by the Mi'kmaq people really be proof of contact dating back approximately 2500 years I don't know when you want to get to the Q&A; because I'm racking up a bunch of ok so you don't believe that the Templars are here with the 1313 treasure Templars are tied in this has a very long Templar trail what we believe is that the Templars were here yes they were here visiting there they were like everyone else has been to this island looking they were looking they weren't here to drop something off they were here looking the whole goal was finding the ark and finding the grill they were looking for the artifacts to re-establish the new jersey it's very intriguing very not only that it's seductive I mean you know we thought we'd heard them all but this one is the biggest one of all it's not that I don't buy it I need more proof okay we're great thank you for the presentation I'm sort of in brain cell overload right now we would like that little chance to talk amongst ourselves certainly let us kick some of this around right now so maybe we can give you some feedback thank you thank you very much thank you he's a very good storyteller but it's time now to set back a little bit and try to discern fact from story salient thing that I do find impressive if you're there really is a hundred percent match to an ancient language JB that's yet to be proved okay well let's say that's true that would be highly significant I mean you know it's a thousand-year disconnect between their trip and the Oak Island mystery what's more than a thousand well you put worse I think he's open-minded to the point where a look the pursuit of history is it's really what he engaged with you and him will get along great you want history in the Met for you and Charles we want this stuff suspend the bull buddy but you know our mission has always been to gather as much data we as we can from every source we can until we finally decide whether to excavate the money pit or not right yeah okay let's go let's go could J Hutton Pulitzers incredible theory be true as far as Rick and Marty are concerned given the strange codes and symbols found throughout the island and the elaborate system of tunnels box drains and booby traps that are believed to afforded attempts to reach whatever it is that lies hidden no Theory no matter how outrageous can be ignored coming up we're pretty sure we can locate the old Halifax tunnel and that'll help us to locate the money pit [Music] the drill boss the drill drill after saying goodbye to J Hutton Pulitzer and after several days of waiting the large drill rig the laginas have ordered makes its way across the Oak Island causeway from the mainland we're gonna bring as big a rig as we need David this one don't get it we're going get a bigger one the team is eager to resume their search for the legendary money pit okay up until now the quarry drilled the team was using was just not powerful enough to penetrate all of the stones wood and other debris that have thwarted the team's efforts to reach their target depth of 140 feet but once the team reaches the money pit why have they chosen to drill to a depth of 140 feet in June of 1897 a previous Oak Island treasure expedition led by William Chappell was drilling core samples in the muddy pit when they found evidence of a mysterious wooden object at a depth of 153 feet the samples later determined that the object was a large box or vault measuring seven feet tall and with walls made of oak seven inches thick even more curious was the fact that the vault appeared to be covered in a white chalky substance that looked like a type of cement but within a few days of his discovery the area surrounding the wooden box now known as the Chappell vault flooded with seawater making the money pit virtually impossible to excavate since that time dozens of treasure hunters have dug more than 40 so-called seeker shafts in the area trying to bypass what is thought to be oak islands elaborate system of underground booby traps and flood tunnels eventually all of these shafts either collapsed or also flooded with seawater and the endless excavations in the area obscured the exact whereabouts of the original treasure shaft in 1965 California geologists turned treasure hunter robert dunfield came to Oak Island determined to solve the mystery after building the causeway that connects the island to the mainland he supervised the excavation of the money pit area the result was a massive crater that measured 100 feet wide by 140 feet deep but before he could reach his target depth of 153 feet the hole collapsed due to a combination of heavy rain and seawater flooding in from what many believe to be a series of underground booby traps defeated Dunfield filled in the massive hole and abandoned his search unfortunately much damage had been done priceless artifacts and important landmarks had been destroyed and the money pit area was now an estimated 10 feet lower than it was when it was originally discovered in 1795 what are we looking for Craig what's your number yeah 15 meters 20 meters for that there you go exports the squat today Marty and Craig tester have agreed to find the money pit by employing a different strategy Marty can you let me know which way needs to go he's a little off that way you know he's here he needs to be over there there's wheels that way come back they will attempt to locate the so-called Halifax tunnel one of the many abandoned searcher tunnels that were dug by treasure hunters hoping to reach the money pit without setting off one of the allegedly booby-trapped flood tunnels we're pretty sure we can locate the old Halifax tunnel which is down about a hundred feet and that'll help us line everything up because that tunnel was run right at the money pit in 1867 men working for the Halifax company dug a 110-foot shaft 200 feet south of the money pit they were hoping to avoid this so-called booby traps that first flooded the pit with seawater just after the 90-foot stone was removed in 1804 unfortunately their strategy didn't work upon reaching the area near the pit seawater flooded the Halifax tunnel nevertheless if Marty and Craig can find the tunnel flooded or not it should lead them directly to the money pit we just want to watch the cuttings we got some idea we're gonna intersect tunnels let's do it using a series of maps and charts made over the years by previous treasure hunters the team has identified two possible locations for the Halifax tunnel number two the Halifax tunnel it's been an orientation point for a lot of the searchers we think it'll be important for us to if it'll help locate the money bit when we get to 45 feet let's make sure we got everything cleared away yeah go from there we're expecting to hit [Music] while we'll be into the top of this tunnel if it's here today a couple hours Oak Island willing Court [Applause] we'll find it we'll find that day come at the south shore near the swamp Gary's gonna do some some metal detecting Rick lagina has joined his nephew Peter Fornetti metal detection expert gary drayton and longtime Oak Island treasure hunter dan henskee to search for coins and other important metal artifacts they are hoping to find evidence to support J Hutton Pulitzers incredible theory that ancient Phoenician sailors brought the Ark of the Covenant to Oak Island more than 2,000 years ago so what do you think I think we should try down this one when Hutton gave us his theory of what happened on Oak Island is that an intriguing story you bet it is but at the end of the day every Theory has to be proven and right now my hand is empty so but it become very compelling to put a twenty five hundred year-old Carthaginian coin them the palm of my hand absolutely I mean I'd do backflips across the ocean for God's sake oh boy one Guinea about to be exposed small antics was in my brain didn't come out my mouth there it is the pull-tab from a 1970s nice this or anything else there the higher tone than the last signal which is good right yeah [Music] come on coin old coin [Music] it's a coin Oh coin well coming up Brian's can be damned I'm gonna bring this back to Marty that's gold baby it's a coin all right fine metal detector expert Gary Drayton has just discovered an antique coin on the south shore of Oak Island could it be like the 17th century Spanish maravedi found in the swamp last summer or could it be much much older this is a British coin yeah it looks like George the second is his nose which one was that yes Britannia sitting on the shield holding a trident this is a British coin 17 is that 1771 a British coin dated before the time of the American Revolution could it have been left behind by someone who came to the island looking for treasure or could it have been dropped by someone who came there to bury it they call these culpas first time I've ever found one fantastic next one has to be a hundred years older than that bit by bit coin by coin the history of Oak Island begins to take shape but could one of the coins the team finds on the island be an important clue to solving the mystery of the money pit or will it be that once one mystery is solved another even more puzzling will immediately take its place let's use this wall as a orientation hall then let's put on five bedrock back at the money pit site Marty lagina and Craig tester are still trying to locate the Halifax tunnel if successful they're hoping it will lead them directly to the money pit we're at least what's going on till we find water because the Halifax tunnel flooded with seawater at a depth of 110 feet hitting water may be an indication that Marty and the team have located the nearly 150 year old shaft unfortunately the only thing they have been able to find so far is dry dirt and no water means no tunnel Bryan's can be I'm discouraged I mean we just spent a bunch of time and money but we missed the tunnel we were looking for so now we are moving to the next one damn it at the south shore near the Oak Island swamp Rick lagina and his team are still searching for ancient coins and other metal artifacts I have a question for you okay I see the red beach area you are dan Rather make anything of that it's most curious no it's quite simple songs the fool's gold and you see the pyrite crystals there yeah for some reasons not stable and it turns to rust on the shore because of its shiny golden appearance iron pyrite a commonly available mineral is also known as fool's gold in 1577 Explorer Martin Frobisher brought over 1,100 tons of fools gold from northern Canada to England claiming he had discovered a genuine gold mine although the worthless nature of his cargo would later be discovered one theory suggests that some of frobisher's abandoned mine shafts were located on Oak Island and that they were later used to hide objects of enormous value like pirate gold the lost manuscripts of William Shakespeare Marie Antoinette's jewels and even priceless religious objects one shot okay now if there's a beautiful run of Fool's Gold crystals there the island is just loaded with this stuff I'm gonna bring this back to Marty that's a gold baby and he'd better believe it that sounds like a good signal Oh can you see this was looking good another coin could it be similar to the ones found earlier or could it be even older like the Carthaginian coins found near the island just a few years ago his bridge and there's the day from the seventeen hundreds the British mayor has been here a lot more than we know about for centuries England and Spain vied for control of the new world's riches in 1762 the British Navy captured the rich Spanish port of Havana millions of dollars of Spanish gold was shipped back to England but some people believe some of that treasure was diverted to Oak Island and hidden by rogue British military leaders could today's incredible discovery of to eighteenth century British coins help to support that theory this is a lot better results than we usually get on Oak Island here as far as what he's recovered it's wonderful information does it tell us the who what when where why and how not yet but it's an answer now that we're on the win side of the column let's let's call it a date we got some coins to clean coming up we need to get back to the money pit and drill the hole we couldn't get down on with a little rig this rig will get down on it [Music] thank you so far Marty and Craig's attempt to locate the shortcut to the money pit by first finding the Halifax tunnel has been unsuccessful they have just enough daylight left to try one more location third why you think what I'd like to be right suddenly as the drill nears 100 feet it starts to slow down could oak islands dense clay soil be proving too much of an obstacle for even this powerful drilling rig to get through [Applause] [Music] now using water to loosen the soil Marty and Craig continue their efforts to find the Halifax tunnel but while water should keep the drill bit from getting stuck it may also make the hole unstable [Music] with the whole they just drilled in danger of collapsing and was still no sign of the elusive Halifax tunnel Marty and Craig have no choice but to shut down their operation alright well I've seen it up didn't work we missed twice so our information wasn't any good we need to go back to the maps see what we did wrong we found two spots where it isn't back to the drawing board plot these do well see we did wrong and get down to the money pinch right yeah we need to get back to the money pit and drill the hole we couldn't get down on with a little rig this rig will get down on it I believe he's got way more horsepower he's got way more pump as far as Marty lagina is concerned another day on Oak Island has come and gone with little to show for it because they haven't been able to locate the Halifax tunnel the laginas and their partners will have to figure out another way to find the money pit we missed you see anything strange at all right don't want no nothing we'll get down into that triangle that Craig's determined has never been drilled maybe find some of the original hopefully valuable stuff that was in the money pit tomorrow's a new day let's go it's a rainy day on Oak Island a day when the weather seems to reflect the collective mood of the laginas and their partners nasty weather as if their problems with finding the money pit weren't enough the brothers and their partners are now worried about another serious issue one which involves pending legislation that could effectively shut down all current treasure hunting activities on the island this is Robert Myra he's the counselor for this area and you're gonna kind of bring us up to speed a little bit on this bill that we're kind of worried about bill 68 Oh sixty infamous you won't believe this last spring a local politician proposed legislation that would effectively treat all of Oak Island as a protected historical site it would also require that any digging or drilling be conducted using the strictest archaeological methods and standards the province would call dibs on some discoveries made at Oak Island oh my god although the laginas and their partners are fairly supportive of the bill's objectives they believe the timing for it is premature as it is largely inspired by various myths and legends about the island and not the concrete evidence the laginas are hoping to find tell us we're concerned and we would like sort of an insider's viewpoint well the bill was bought the console and was talked about and seems like the government instead of 10% of the charges they went 25% honestly when we first found out about that bill you should have right yeah shocked us you know the most perplexing thing about Bill 68 is that we've been very respectful of the island the history the lore and and the Nova Scotian heritage so we've always behaved honorably and with integrity we've jumped through every hoop every requirement the treasure of license says historical artifacts I'm half stay in Canada and then we intend to abide by that we had in archaeology as part of the treasure trove license go through the entire island he you know he said there's been so much activity from searchers that most of the island doesn't have historical value because it just been too many holes don't why not I think there's a story here a story that belongs to Nova Scotia in particular into the world in general and we're very respectful and always take care that in the discovery process that's first and foremost some of the provisions of that bill basically would allow the whole process to be shut down without notice we have a lot invested here in money time emotion and they might all get taken away they do have news so you coming up this rig is much heavier they don't get it jacked up properly the rig could tip for the past few months Rick Marty and the other members of the Oak Island team have been concerned about the fate of a new piece of provincial legislation that could threaten to halt all of their present activities on Oak Island they do have news for you bill 68 is no longer in power their livers got rid of it good we got all kinds of things to worry about here this is welcome news at a time when good news has been in short supply they may bring it back I may not I can't say that right but for right now from our standpoint it's dead we have to worry about no okay it was a tremendous relief because I mean let's face it we have enough issues out here without having to sort of fight a rearguard action against the rules being changed we only need one adversary and it's it's here it's Oak Island armed with the knowledge that their activities on oak island have the support of the government the laginas and their partners can once again turn their attention to finding the original money pit dürdane frustrated by their unsuccessful attempts to locate the money pit by way of the Halifax tunnel Rick lagina and Craig tester have decided to return to their original strategy and find the money pit by drilling and extracting a number of core samples because I know you guys thought you weren't be right that's our preference but first they're going to need to know if the 30-ton drill rig they've hired can drill through the layers of rocks and debris left behind by previous treasure hunters since we've already got those two wells we kind of jumped over to this side the problem is we were in a lot of wood right here but drilling through dense layers of wooden stone may not be the drill rigs biggest obstacle my concern though is this the ground being consol because then yes I'm back up further right over unconsolidated stuff yeah I'd hate to see the rig start doing this that would not be good good to go okay well then let's do it the rig we previously had here is a fairly small rig early light this rig is much bigger much heavier they could sink down into the mud or it could cause a cavity to collapse bringing Jordans rig in it's two to three times as heavy as the geotech ring they don't get it jacked up properly with sufficient boards the rig could tip we're looking for that vault at the 140-foot level so we find anything man-made significant below there I mean I think it'll just make it much more easy making a decision whether it isn't right do the Big Dig or not let's just give it a try and see what happens the Big Dig Craig tester is referring to involves a complete excavation of the money pit site down to a depth of 140 feet first they will have to find a way of shutting off or blocking out the seawater that floods the pit then they will have to dig an enormous hole and hope that it won't collapse before they can retrieve whatever it is they find at the bottom but will it be pirate gold precious jewels sacred religious objects before will they find nothing at all that suckers heavy the drill rig begins to sink into the mud could an ancient mine shaft or searcher tunnel be collapsing deep underground the large drill rig the laginas are trying to use at the money pit is now seeking into the oak island mud centuries of digging and drilling have made the ground soft and unstable even more dangerous is the possibility that numerous underground treasure tunnels have rotted with time and could collapse at any moment you think Keith yeah one of the problems with this whole venture is we were drilling probably in film either from a shaft that was filled or from mr. dunfield's excavations or from a shaft that collapsed maybe it was leaning over a little bit lay down mats that way everyday never go down come down on top of mats okay [Music] there's 220 years of digging drilling blasting boring and given all the disturbances in that area that ground was still soft we do have safety concerns here and the biggest one is was the cavity formed at some point in time and put that cave in if it is with the original vault that we're caving and that would not be good news because we're hoping to get down to it but this is the money pit area and you never know when something might go wrong after some fast teamwork Rick and Craig managed to pack the hole with rocks adding stability to the ground beneath Jordans rig I'm never afraid to get my hands dirty Craig and I were tossing boulders in the hole I mean I'll do anything look we're here to solve this and you know if I had to carry bricks on my back for 50 miles every day I'd do it I'm gonna do whatever it takes because I'm in the fight and we're here to win seems to be pretty stable there okay so let's get stealing before [Applause] let's cross our fingers and hope this goes [Applause] once again Oak Island has been successful at keeping its most precious secret hidden but will the laginas and their partners like all the previous dreamers and treasure seekers who came to Oak Island ultimately leave beaten and empty-handed or will they fight back beat the odds and finally solve the mystery that has eluded men and women for more than 200 years the island tends to take a toll it teaches you a lesson you can't constantly think that every morning you're gonna wake up and you're going to find the answers it's not just a one-day trip this pursuit is long-term there's a reason it's called the money pit it has sucked a lot of money out of a lot of people over the years but we're on a quest we're doing something that we love and we're not giving up next time on the curse of Oak Island why not this is looking very expensive and not too much reward this is fun in the bottom of a swamp what the hell is that a big tree stump what's that doing out in the middle Nolan wouldn't have grown underwater and the swamp came after the tree he's man-made it's the money pit I want to see what's down there that's the top of the vault looks like we might have it right Wow guys do you think you're on the ball Subtitled by
