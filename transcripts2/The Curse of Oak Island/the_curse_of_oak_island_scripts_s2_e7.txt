 Previously on the curse of Oak Island in order to dig in the money pit we have to shut off all the flood phones and maybe this digest will lead us in that direction my green coming out of there we're here to the south of France trying to take back to find the roots of this if you were gonna look for the treasure of the Knights Templar it's not the bulk item ties to Oak Island are here supposedly it all comes together it was

 Scotland you need to come get me to Scotland there is an island in the North Atlantic where men have been looking for treasure for more than 200 years so far they have uncovered booby-trapped flood tunnels carved stones with strange symbols 17th century Spanish coins and evidence of a wooden vault covered in concrete six men have even lost their lives trying to solve the mystery according to legend we'll have to die before the treasure can

 okay let's do this Jack you going in sure Rick yeah who's getting wet Jack Walters ever since finding evidence of a mysterious wooden vault buried deep within the money pit treasure hunter Rick lagina is determined to find an efficient way of getting to it Charles here take this because the object is buried more than 140 feet below ground and surrounded by what are believed to be a network of booby-trapped flood tunnels Rick believes the key to shutting off the water and getting to the money pit might be found hidden in the Oak Island swamp something just floated up in between my toes it's probably an eel due to environmental regulations the water from the swamp cannot be pumped into the nearby ocean so the team will need to divert it several hundred yards away to the western side of the island that's good that's good did you do it that'll work because there is a widespread belief that the triangle-shaped swamp is man-made many Oak Island researchers believe that everything from a sophisticated hydraulic system to a vast underground treasure vault might lie buried under four and a half acres of brackish water and muck okay good job just don't drink any of that okay good job jack Dave you're up crank it let's go when Rick and his partners tried to drain the swamp one year ago they found that their efforts were undermined by a series of natural springs that put water back in the swamp almost as fast as they could pump it out this year Rick will be using a larger and more powerful pumping system he will also be setting up additional pumping stations at two more strategic points and running the pumps for a longer period of time we need to solve this and I've said it before and I'll say it again I think there's answers to be gained in the swamp and they're not gonna come easy but it has to be done and it will be done we're gonna go check the road if all goes according to plan Rick lagina is confident that the swamp should be fully drained in just a few days time enough for him to travel some 3,000 miles across the Atlantic to Scotland where he and other members of the team have been invited to join Marty and Marty's son Alex who have been on a fact-finding mission of their own gentlemen welcome to Scotland this is our driver Jack Jack why are we driving on the wrong side of the road it is the right side of the road actually looks like we're here I see the ocean here at Saltcoats kathleen mcgowan has arranged for Rick Marty and the team to meet with Alan Butler a prolific English author who has done extensive research on the Knights Templar and the various myths and stories connected to them welcome to Scotland you might want to know why we brought you to a rainy part of Scotland like this in connection with that place Oak Island so far away across this ocean but I think in order to explain it I need to take you somewhere where we can get a better view of the surrounding area okay I take it this is a lovely day here [Applause] oh it's nice yeah if you look around you can see that this is a really good natural harbour things particularly important because it's shielded by another part of the mainland of Scotland and also by the islands it was a place where the French would never have dared to come according to McGowan and Butler the Cathars a group of early Christians who traced their origins back to the days of Jesus placed a number of sacred objects including the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail into the hands of the Knights Templar who in turn hid the objects at various locations in France before taking them here to Saltcoats the Templar see see this place is refuge and not England the most famous of the Scottish Kings Robert de Bru's he had killed one of his opponents on the steps of a church altar that made the Pope quite cross so he has communicated Robert the Bruce and the whole of Scotland and that just happened to coincide with the time when the Templars were made illegal according to legend on Friday the 13th 1307 King Philip the 4th of France and Pope Clement the 5th conspired to have the Templars arrested and executed on charges of heresy although it is believed by some researchers they came Philip the fourth really persecuted the Templars because he had fallen into debt with them and wanted to confiscate their great wealth by 1312 the Knights Templar were nearly disbanded but not before 18 ships believed to be carrying a precious cargo of religious artifacts left La Rochelle France and route to Scotland so the treasure of the Cathars and the Templars comes into this Harbor that's very very protected and they could have done it in a very secretive way and these treasures were talking about things like the Ark of the Covenant the temple of the tables of Solomon the Holy Grail could only be held on sacred ground so they would have taken the treasure from here to a sacred place and that would be Kilwinning Abbey and that's where we're gonna go next okay did the Knights Templar really bring priceless treasures including the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail to Scotland for safekeeping and if so was it to prepare for an even greater journey one that would take these sacred religious artifacts across the Atlantic Ocean to Oak Island when I sit back and think about these theories honestly they're all far-fetched and generally they're all credible they're both so we listen and we're gonna look okay let's go coming up there's a tunnel here jack yeah I'm saying dig here yeah the ark paint here took the winning that will ultimately lead to the finding of the treasure back on Oak Island as the swamp continues to drain researcher Jack Begley is looking for a way to get to the bottom of the money pit without breaching one of the supposed booby-trapped flood tunnels with him is veteran treasure hunter dan Blankenship who's nearly 50 years of treasure hunting while living on the island makes him an invaluable human resource jack is curious about a strange clearing known as the bald spot a mysterious patch of land on the island where trees inexplicably don't seem to grow I really like the spot already because it's above high tide line and it's right off the boulderless beach we have to figure this all out before we get the claw digger in here oh all I need to do is to try and help you out and tell you what I think is there and then you know take it from there if we're gonna be digging here how deep do you think this well I'll just watch I've never seen dowsing before I'm really interested to see if there are chambers or flood tunnels deep underground dan Blankenship is using an unconventional and fairly controversial method dowsing the ground condition is perfect for dowsing wet good also referred to as divining dowsing dates back to the 15th century and entails walking in a straight line while holding two l-shaped wooden or metal rods parallel to the ground if the rods cross without any manipulation it may be an indication that a water source or a tunnel may lie hidden down below now I'm gripping them tight I'm perfect okay now they come by themselves you straighten them out when you see the raj cross is this attempted something is it an attraction of something is making a Raj crowd and in all probability is a tunnel although not scientifically proven dowsing has actually been employed for years in the well-drilling and energy industries it was by this method back in 1969 that dan Blankenship became convinced he had found a location that might provide an alternate means of reaching the money pit 10-x he digs down 235 feet and he finds this chamber underground and best of my knowledge all he used was dowsing which is something I don't believe in so then you're left with the conclusion that I guess he was either incredibly lucky or perhaps dowsing works there's a tunnel here jack if dan blankenship did just locate a tunnel could it be one of the so-called flood tunnels connected to the money pit I suspect there to be another tunnel coming out of here I want to see whether they can fix that up yeah I did already I picked it up here's the cross tunnel I was telling you about I'm saying dig here for the only reason that it's adjacent to two cross tunnels this is the hottest place I would say that's what I like to hear Dan I'd like to hear nearly 3,000 miles away Rick Marty and Alex lagina along with Dave Blankenship and Charles Barkhouse arrive with researchers Kathleen McGowan and Alan Butler at Kilwinning Abbey considered by some to be among the most sacred sites in Scotland this is a monastery built by a group of monks called the Turin anciens you know some monks pray some monks farm these guys were builders founded in Tehran france in 1109 the tironensian order adhered strictly to what was known as the rule of Saint Benedict which allowed little more than prayer and work over the years the monks developed an astounding knowledge of architecture and engineering which in turn led to the construction of more than 100 sacred Abbey's and priories across France England Ireland Wales and Scotland within a five-year period but the terran indians were not only known for their ability to build structures above ground they were also expert at building tunnel systems such as the one believed to be at Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland which connects the chapel to a nearby castle now there's a strong tradition that the ark came here to Kilwinning but is there any reason you think it's here in Kilwinning aside from just the fact that it would be a good spot for it yeah I'm absolutely certain that they would have kept it here as much as anything else because it was so close to the coast and they knew that there would come a time when they had to get it out very quickly the Templars were very forward-looking people if they wanted to do something they went to see the people who were already doing that thing they needed to come to people who could build and those people were the tironensians Kathleen McGowan and Alan Butler are among those who believe that members of the Knights Templar brought their treasures including the Ark of the Covenant here to Kilwinning Abbey after fleeing from France in 1312 they also believe the Templars and later the freemasons forged a secret alliance with tironensian monks to hide these sacred objects on Oak Island Freemasonry took over to a great extent from the Templars in carrying that message forward and Freemasonry has been really important on Oak Island I'm sure but that will ultimately lead to the finding of the treasure I came away thinking yes there's a good chance there were some amazing things that were spirited away with the fall of the Knights Templar and there's a credible case made that they could have gone to Scotland it makes sense politically at the time but we're trying to connect the dots back to Oak Island the next parts of called to me one of the most amazing places in the world is Rosslyn Chapel and Kathleen's gonna take you that great great perfect coming up we're really hoping to find the top of a tunnel yeah Scottish Knights went to the new world before Columbus perhaps there may have been some other purpose for that voyage well Rick Marty and the other members of their team are in Scotland tracing the possible connections between the Knights Templar and Oak Island a bald spot Drake Craig tester his son Drake and stepson Jack Begley are at the mysterious area on the island known as the bald spot see how there's no living trees in this wide open area they are preparing to excavate where dan Blankenship believes one of the islands legendary flood tunnels runs underground that's why we want to go ahead and excavate down and see if there's any rooms or tunnels just 1012 feet down this area has also been of interest to Oak Island treasure hunters because it is next to what is known as the boulderless beach the only stretch of beach on the island where all rocks and boulders appear to have been cleared away could it be hiding another flood system like the one found in 1850 at Smith's Cove or Dan wanna dig first break where this dump is it has a tunnel leading straight over to where that other crossroads point is about in the middle of-of this bald spot here again in order to see if Dan Blankenship's theory is correct Craig tester has hired an excavator which can dig down approximately 12 feet well the place you want to try digging is that stump right there with this dig we're really hoping to find is the top of a tunnel or a room it's gonna be cribbed or have wood supporting it we're about halfway there we think take a look oh I'm not seeing any cribbing yeah no I mean either yeah you might be able to get another foot or so although the excavator is approaching its maximum depth of 12 feet and as yet there is no sign of a tunnel a tunnel might still exist dowsing while believed to be effective at finding sources of water underground is not generally effective at calculating depth in other words a flood tunnel may exist underground what may lie farther down than the excavator can reach how deep you think we are now I think we're about 12 feet I'll feed that's the deepest of skulls yeah thank and see how it's doing no wood though we're not seeing anything here so we'll move to another location okay as digging and pumping activities continue on Oak Island Rick Marty and the other members of their team are looking for important clues in one of the most mysterious buildings in Scotland Rosslyn Chapel look at that absolutely magnificent boy did they create some magnificent things in stone at Rosslyn Chapel it's clearly ornate it's beautiful it's inspiring Rosslyn Chapel was designed and commissioned by William Sinclair a powerful member of a clan with ties to the Knights Templar it was built by Freemasons in approximately 1456 Wow amazing originally designed to be a Catholic Church many researchers believe the strange carvings on the walls and ceilings of the chapel contain numerous clues it could be instrumental in solving the Oak Island mystery and we're particularly interested in North American influence in the chapel and that's simply because we've come looking for a connection to Oak Island in North America that perhaps referencing this Sinclair voyage that there may have been some interaction or some purpose for that voyage or other voyages to in the world so legend is that Scottish Knights went to the new world before Columbus born there are those who believe that in 1398 nearly a century before Christopher Columbus sets sail to the Americas William Sinclair's grandfather Prince Henry Sinclair sailed across the ocean from Scotland to what would become known as Nova Scotia or New Scotland he was accompanied on his journey by members of the Knights Templar and their goal was to hide not only the vast Templar treasure but sacred religious artifacts like the Ark of the Covenant the golden menorah of King Solomon and the Holy Grail one of the theories we've heard is that the MiG Mob people the original people in the Nova Scotia area have some symbols that are like some phoned in here according to the historical timeline of the Mi'kmaq First Nation tribes people of Nova Scotia contact with Europeans was made in 1398 it has been reported that the Mi'kmaq saw Henry Sinclair as a god named Glooscap and that he taught them new ways of fishing and navigating this possible connection between the native peoples of Nova Scotia and the Knights Templar is made even more convincing when comparing the Templar battle flag of Henry Sinclair to the ceremonial flag used by the Mi'kmaq they are virtually identical the legend here is that Prince Henry Sinclair in 1398 sailed to the New World and brought back with him corn and if you look up here there is what may appear to be maize or as we have called Indian corn this chapel was built well before Christopher Columbus went to America corne could this be the first important clue directly linking Rosslyn Chapel to the Oak Island mystery coming up it's ten feet we'll hit it if it's 15 feet we're not gonna hit it the money pit is a deliberately constructed copy of Solomon's Temple at Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland Rick and Marty lagina have just been shown stone carvings of what many believe to be corn corn is a grain that is native to North America and could not have been known in this part of the world until after Columbus is so called discovery of the new world in 1492 so how did it come to be incorporated into the architecture of a chapel built in 1456 there are those who believe that Prince Henry Sinclair a member of the Knights Templar visited North America in 1398 nearly 100 years before Columbus and that the inclusion of corn and the design of the chapel serves as an important clue directly linking Sinclair to the Oak Island mystery on a recent visit to oak island swedish researcher daniel ronnstam suggested that the stone slab found in the money pit contains secret instructions for stopping the ocean water that floods the pit by using something as simple as dry corn could William Sinclair have intended these carvings to serve as a means of instructing future generations of Templars on how to retrieve their sacred treasure stash honestly it looks like you can see the little corn kernels yes there are other carvings such as the aloe vera and Trillium which against North American plants and interestingly our botanist believed the Trillium Moss Trillium so we have to believe that the people who carved this Chapel were far traveled corn is a new world crop and one of the key things is that there appears to be a carving of a Trillium while trilliums would been unknown to the people who built that Chapel had they not been to North America people come to this chapel for many different reasons and with many different beliefs and we respect all the different beliefs that people come with so we can't say definitively contain we didn't sail to the New World and that's part of the the magic and mystery of the place we're very used to non-definitive answers we Rex were experts in non-definitive answers was it an inspiring and was it quite an amazing place to visit yes it was but as it regards this search I don't know so what do you guys think of Rosslyn I need time to digest at all I really do it's overwhelming you got a lot of dot to connect sensory overload we need we need to discuss all this and let it gel I mean it's spectacular our friend Alan Butler has been working all day to put together a presentation for you guys so if you're ready we can go have a drink and meet with Alan well we definitely need a drink there's a wonderful bar called the Grail down the street maybe we should go there we seek the Grail we seek the Grail let's go back on Oak Island treasure hunters Craig tester and Jack Begley are about to dig a second test hole at the area known as the bald spot so named because large trees have never been known to grow there after dowsing the area dan Blankenship believes that one of the reasons for the scarce vegetation might be that one of the man-made flood tunnels that feeds ocean water into the money pit could lie underground dan talk about it was it was over he put some some sticks in the ground and okay there's like a crossroads he thinks that that the tunnels that are here they crisscross but they're not at the same level he thought that that was gonna be the highest one and then this was the other hotspot he had and pretty much right in the center of all just these sticks a good place to start right here that stick is the center of the whole yeah correct I'm still enthusiastic about this area but we don't have a good idea how deep these rooms or tunnels might be it's ten feet we'll hit it if it's 15 sheep we're not gonna hit it take a look Wow coming up I would back to mother stone that ax marks the spot suppose it took exactly your life savings to dig it up would you do it at the strange treeless area on oak island known as the bald spot Craig tester and Jack Begley are hoping to unearth one of the islands possible booby-trapped flood tunnels let's see how it's doing Wow okay seven or eight feet you know like halfway there this one's been going pretty good no wood though yeah a lot of boulders unfortunately the excavator they are using can only reach a depth of 12 feet and there is no telling how deep the flood tunnel could be assuming one exists to test and Blankenship's findings the team will have to return to the site with larger and more powerful digging equipment well I think we're at 12 feet here again and that we're not finding anything so it could be natural but there's not no trees here but it could be that the tunnels are a little deeper so we'll look at maybe running seismic maybe a ground-penetrating radar but I'm not done bringing it here for sure I sure hope they're having better luck in Europe than we're having here right now on their last night in Scotland Rick and Marty lagina have arranged to have a final meeting with researchers Kathleen McGowan and Alan Butler time for a pint of bitter plain of something Rick Marty and the team have spent the last two days investigating the theory that the treasures of the Knights Templar including the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail it could have made their way from France to Scotland and then possibly to Oak Island it's time to connect the dots I hope you think it's worthwhile when you heard what we've got to say when I read the account of how McGinnis and his friends first started to dig at the money pit the first thing they came across a couple of feet under the turf was a platform of flat stones why is this significant well it's got to do with a threshing floor often referred to in the Holy Bible a threshing floor is a paved surface where sheaves of crops are spread out and trampled in order to separate the edible grains from the stalks but threshing floors also came to represent spiritual truth and were used to mark very symbolic religious locations one of the greatest examples was the foundation used in building the original temple of King Solomon on what is now known as the Temple Mount in Jerusalem he said the dimensions of that were the size of a threshing floor or the dimensions of the original dig are quite small yeah that's all they were yeah yeah fresh applause were very small who are they always circular yes I've never seen one that wasn't while exploring Oak Island in 1795 Daniel McGinnis and his friends Anthony Vaughn and John Smith found a circular depression 13 feet in diameter in the ground at the foot of an old oak tree because the area had been frequented by Spanish and Portuguese pirates they believed they had found buried treasure they began to dig and two feet deep they found a layer of flat paving stones not found anywhere else on the island could they have really uncovered a threshing floor meant to mark the location not of pirate treasure but something of great spiritual and religious significance it's rung a bell in my mind especially in connection with how much interest Freemasons had shown to Oak Island it's got to do with a particular part of Freemasonry which is called the Royal Arch of Enoch in the Old Testament of the Bible Enoch is the great-grandfather of Noah the man who on God's command built an ark to ensure humans and animals would survive the Great Flood according to the so-called legend of Enoch an ancient series of texts used by freemasons enoch built a structure deep underground that would ensure that all the important knowledge and treasures of the world would also survive the first eight chambers Enoch constructed were meant for protection but in the ninth and final chamber he placed a triangle of pure gold known as the Delta on which the name of God was written he also placed a collection of great scientific and historical knowledge alongside it time rolls by and along come the children of Israel and King Solomon builds the temple they find the entrance to the Enochian chambers some Masonic legends say that Solomon added to the treasures that were there where the Ark of the Covenant ultimately found its way into the temple and when the Knights Templar were eventually able to build their own new Jerusalem the money pit was deliberately constructed copy of Solomon's Temple and the chambers of Enoch in 1804 the Onslow company excavated what became known as the money pit and found nine platforms made of oak logs every ten feet at the ninth and final level the so-called 90-foot stone was discovered on which mysterious carved symbols were found could these nine platforms really have been constructed to represent the nine chambers of King Solomon's Temple if it's ever possible to say that x marks the spot I would bet a modest sum that what you're looking for is another shaft with another chamber which is 996 feet due west of the money pit they hate to do this to Marty but the prophecies about the New Jerusalem say that the New Jerusalem will be built on an island of swamp x marks the spot what you're looking for is another shaft with another chamber on there last night in Scotland Rick Marty and the other members of their team have just been told by researcher Alan Butler that a secret chamber that connects to the money pit can be found 996 feet due west right on the edge of the Oak Island swamp but how did Alan Butler arrive at such a precise measurement everything about the money pits the structure itself with its paving slabs the size of it lead me to believe the whole design is based on a linear unit of measurement the megalithic yard equal to two point seven two feet the megalithic yard is believed by some researchers to have been used as an ancient unit of measurement in the construction of many mysterious megalithic structures including Stonehenge in later years the Freemasons adopted this unit of measurement in the building of other often sacred sites including Rosslyn Chapel we know the gap between Rosslyn Chapel and Rosslyn Castle is 366 megalithic yards that is equivalent to 996 feet and I think that is the situation Oak Island so if we look at what the Templars are doing creating a new Jerusalem using the Enochian model there would be a chamber that is 366 make looks yards away the other end of the tunnel is at a fixed Compass Point from the origin which makes me think it's more likely it would be due west am I to understand looking at this that we're back in that bloody swamp yes No tell me it isn't true it's surprising really how many different theories keep landing in that swamp and it's been no secret I'd like to stick a big fork in the swamp we'd be done with it I hate that swamp so how sure are you of this me yeah absolutely sure suppose it took exactly your life savings to dig it up would you do it considering I'm as poor as a Churchmouse it wouldn't be much of a no but that's still the measure is I'd I would well then on that note let's you big brother says okay big brother the question was asked earlier would you commit to this endeavor and the answer for me is I will we're going to drain the swamp anyway I don't care still a mucky mess but I don't care how difficult to this I really don't I mean I'll go in there by myself Matt Rick lagina is why you are going to find this treasure we are going to the dots were not as close as I would have liked but these people came with a theory rather elegant theory at the end of the presentation they gave us information that we could act on they put an axe on the Mary that's rare yeah one thing occurs to me that is interesting is that how many people actually get to say that I spent a portion of my life seeking the Grail legitimate anyway so thank you very much Cheers to the quest to the question for Rick Marty and their partners the trip to Europe has been both informative and motivating finally the troops arrived they are heading back to Oak Island more convinced than ever that something of great significance may lie buried deep inside the money pit here's the plan we'll shoot this and that an important key to reaching it might be found at the bottom of the swamp a swamp that has so far been able to keep its secrets hidden life takes a lot of twists and turns it's kind of what makes it interesting so it's hugely important that we listen to theorists yay but we need to get data in credible usable definitive data I would like to be able to say there's something to excavate here in the swamp at the end of the day you have to prove the theory take it into the field take theory into practice take theory to result there's a story here a magnificent story something happened long ago I would like to play whatever part necessary to find out what that is will the laginas and their partners find sacred treasures hidden away by the Knights Templar or will it be something else something so incredible that finding it will not represent the end but only the beginning next time on the curse of Oak Island right here's where we're gonna start I'm just so sick of this slop something right there he just got a reading he's saying we got multiple hits in the same area you got some divers coming in and we'll concentrate on 10x you're ready to go let's do this what's in the bottom of 10x we're getting into analysis paralysis I am wanting to quit what do you mean you want to quit Subtitled by Diego Moraes www.oakisland.tk
