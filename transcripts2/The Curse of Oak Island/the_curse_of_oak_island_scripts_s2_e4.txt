 Tonight on the curse of Oak Island I'm not willing to give up you don't think we could put an extra phone though why not this is looking very expensive and not too much reward this was found in the bottom of the swamp what the hell is that that big tree stuff what's that doing on the middle no I wouldn't have grown underwater then the swamp came after the truth he's man-made it's the money pit

 I want to see what's down there that's the top of the vault looks like we might have been right oh wow guys do you think you're on the vault there is an island in the North Atlantic where men have been looking for treasure for more than 200 years they have uncovered booby-trapped flood tunnels carved stones with strange symbols even 17th century Spanish coins six men have even lost their lives according to legend one more will have to die before the treasure can be found two more

 start pouring after two full weeks of drilling Rick and Marty lagina their partner Craig tester and the other members of the Oak Island team are still trying to locate the original money pit how far are you gonna go get to 140 I think you'd be happy since purchasing property on Oak Island seven years ago brothers Rick and Marty lagina have employed a very simple strategy follow up on every lead and explore every Theory until tangible evidence of a treasure is found so far they have found coconut fiber at Smith's Cove dating as far back as 1260 ad coconut fiber that is believed to have been used as a filter to keep ocean debris from clogging a series of underground booby-trapped flood tunnels at the area known as Nolan's cross they found evidence of a number of large flat-sided stones indicating that the boulders that make up the cross might be part of an elaborate treasure map one that points to the Knights Templar the lost manuscripts of William Shakespeare and sacred religious objects from the temple of King Solomon at the swamp they found a 17th century Spanish coin this could be something big which validates the many stories indicating that what lies buried on Oak Island may very well be pirate treasure it's a Spanish maravedi probably from the 1600s now they are determined to locate the biggest and most challenging target of all the original Oak Island money pit to find it will take a combination of time tenacity and luck three things the laginas are beginning to think they're running out of hit any boulders no wood goal of any long don't meddle I can tolerate anything but metal money pit who knows what's down there because this legendary treasure site has been dug up and filled in more than a dozen times over the past 200 years virtually all natural landmarks or man-made markers have been obliterated and vintage Maps indicating the money pits exact location have either been lost or destroyed over time well you can see it caved in Rick and I had filled it with a bunch of boulders for the past several years Craig tester has scoured scores of books in two centuries worth of anecdotal evidence in order to determine where to begin gathering a number of core samples if just one of the samples contains physical evidence that can be dated to before 1795 then the Tingler found the original money pit unfortunately much of the area surrounding the pit is filled with layers of wood planking stones and other man-made debris left behind by Past treasure hunters which conventional coring drills could not dig through for this reason the team has brought in a 30-ton drill rig outfitted with drill bits powerful enough to grind and dig through just about anything small PVC white pipes are well we couldn't get down deep enough so we pulled forward a little bit we still should be in but they call that Triangle area that's where Mr said his father had drilled into them a margin back in the eighteen hundreds yeah long time ago we're hoping to do that again with this hole in 1897 Oak Island treasure hunter and drill operator William Chappell while drilling core samples in the original money pit discovered evidence of what he believed to be a large wooden vault at his depth of 153 feet it was covered in something that looked like concrete and on his drill bit he found what looked like flakes of gold small bits of metal and even a piece of parchment with the letters VI clearly visible but before Chappell could dig a hole deep enough to reach the mysterious wooden vault water flooded the shaft Oh caved in and the exact location of the mysterious wooden vault was feared to be lost forever while trying to find the vault in the 1950s William chapels son Melvin deduced that his father's original drill site was located at an area on the island he dubbed the Triangle area the Triangle area was something we discovered in a book and then Rick and Craig delineated where this triangle area is so we're gonna drill basically kind of in the middle of it mm-hmm trying to find that vault unfortunately for the laginas mel chappell also noted that due to the unique characteristics of rotary drilling it might be virtually impossible to find the wooden vault this is due to the fact that when drilling at great depths the drill bit may veer off several degrees based on various underground factors such as soil conditions and possible obstructions what's that that black thing over there that's a new method to separate the air from the water and samples on the side there's a hole where the chute the water in the air and the material they're bringing up and it'll spin in a circle in there and the air will go out the top in the water and sediments will fall out the bottom then hopefully we get good samples all right so we're hoping everyone hit the vault yeah bring some of that shiny stuff laughs fingers crossed we want this color can I use it as an example no as operations at the drill site continue Rick lagina has asked his brother Marty and other members of their team to join him for a quick meeting in the war room okay before we start we have one piece of good news we're always looking for good news right you have the drainage permit for the swamp for Marty news that the team has received permission to drain and dig in the Oak Island swamp doesn't exactly make him happy last summer they got encouraging readings indicating the presence of non-ferrous or precious metal near the so-called mercy point only to then have the readings mysteriously disappear this is crazy you get a hit it goes away yeah and you come up with nothing how's that possible this past winter big spike here the team scanned the frozen oak island swamp using a deepmax x6 metal detection unit still spoken but a detailed analysis of the data they collected turned out to be less than positive you know I met with dave spencer from kellyco yesterday and we finally did get a report from lorenz on the x6 and the z1 and honestly it's not that hopeful do you have the letter yeah yes I mean this is not too encouraging because at the very end he says unfortunately there are only one or two ferrous metal objects we could see all the others are of no interest that's his summation I hope that is not too disappointing for you I hate that swamp have been clear about that stinky nasty swamp we've run every state-of-the-art instrumentation out there we're still not sure so I would be willing to say what look we gave that the old college try and be done and put more emphasis on the money pit guys I don't want to dig anything in the swamp that's where I'm at what do you wanted I want to confirm that the two items that were found yeah are those two targets and we can do it very simply with a bomb you don't think we you don't think we can put an X through swallow why not because we're not done yet we're not I'm not walking away coming up there's something there and I intend to find out let's take a vote where's that water coming from you don't think we can put an X through swung why not because we're not done yet we're not I'm not walking away the situation in the war room has suddenly become tense as brothers Rick and Marty lagina find themselves a faceoff they could affect the future of their entire operation ever since he was an 11 year old boy growing up in northern Michigan retired postal worker Rick lagina has dedicated himself to solving the Oak Island mystery he believes that somewhere at the bottom of the triangle-shaped swamp the entrance to a vast underground treasure vault may lie hidden yes we don't walk away 190 percent of the way there okay I'm not done with the swamp the swamp is not done with us there's something there and I intend to find out all right I'm not willing to give up I know that and so let's take a vote fine right now okay all those we want to continue in this one continued and I then I will I will respectfully disagree but I will wholeheartedly participate ecstatic about us going back into the swamp ring they say one more time I hate that swamp it stinks its buggy it's nasty oh love it yeah when you pull Tutankhamen's second treasure over there yeah I'll like it then don't get too crazy on me now that the laginas and their partners have agreed to continue investigating the Oak Island swamp Marty has called in a local tree expert to examine a large stump that was pulled out of the water a few weeks ago we want it well Joe look appreciate you coming off we got some mysteries we want faults I understand you're the guy to do it well well you know all things book trees right yes marty is curious to know if the stump found at the bottom of the swamp could have naturally grown in water here's my first question and I know this is difficult because this is weathered and waterlogged and everything but can you tell what species this is not definitively now I would say it's probably hardwood it's been underwater for some time and it probably wouldn't have grown very well completely submerged underwater one would have to assume it it was a above water it's home time yeah yeah I mean this has been five feet of water it wasn't grown there no you wouldn't think as hardwood trees like the many Oaks found on Oak Island cannot grow in water the stump found in the swamp may help prove that one of the islands most compelling and persistent theories is true that the islands triangle-shaped swamp is in fact man-made but how according to many Oak Island theorists the swamp was most likely formed by creating a 250 yard long coffer dam bridging the east and west portions of the island then draining out the water and later refilling the area but what would have been the purpose of such an elaborate engineering effort the creation of an artificial swamp would have offered a perfect means to first dig a large underground vault or network of tunnels barri something of great value and then covered up beneath thousands of gallons of dark brackish water water which would also make access to the site difficult if not virtually impossible the fact of how certain Jill was that that tree couldn't possibly have grown in that location with the swamp in place makes me want to not give up on the swamp makes me want to kind of get back in there do a little more research the island lures us in again is what I would call that Marty's renewed interest in exploring the swamp is a sign of his commitment to pursue his brothers lifelong dream of solving the Oak Island mystery but Marty is also a practical man and he is starting to consider what will happen if the costs start getting too high at the drill site Rick lagina and Craig tester learned that the larger rig has been successful at reaching a depth of 115 feet but they are still 25 feet shy of their target depth of 140 feet the depth they will need to reach if they are ever defined not only the money pit but also the Chappell vault okay solve this damn thing once and for all are you going to record books the original descriptions were clay-filled holes that's where we want to be the Clay's where the original money pit is and so we'll start fresh with this last joint than any material that comes through will be brand-new and we could be in virgin territory even we're not that deep we may be in an area that nobody said so we'll take a good look at everything from here on out I got some screams to help build their stuff out well somebody's gonna have to be here yeah the best-case scenario we see something really critical will wave-wave jordan off that's good idea last thing you wanted missile as water and debris pour into the trailer Rick and Craig search through the mud for any evidence that might indicate they could be close to finding the original money pit treasure shaft and gravel clay no we're gonna finding it I mean you know it'd be best if I were elected much the description of the old money pit solid clay-filled shaft we get into the solid clay-filled shaft we have a better idea of where the money pit was and then maybe we can drill a few more holes to try to split spoon our way down and maybe then recover suddenly gallons of muddy water gush out of the drill hole got the number from below the water issue is a concern it's a danger where's that water coming from we don't know is it flood tunnels or are we actually getting water from some unknown source and may destabilize the whole working platform worst case scenario of the rig topples I mean no one wants that could rake in Craig if hit one of the booby-trapped flood tunnels the same flood tunnels that according to legend flooded the money pit 200 years ago and that continue to flood other searcher tunnels and shafts like the Halifax tunnel and 10x it's rockin pretty good could the search for the money pit be over before it even had a chance to get started coming up how's the drilling going it's frustrating I want to tell you what Craig it's expensive too you know how much of the hourly is for that rig at some point we all have to be thinking wind is enough be coming out rocking pretty good step back while trying to drill a 140-foot hole in the money pit area to get a core sample Rick lagina and Craig tester have accidently tapped into a gusher of water could they have struck one of the legendary booby-trapped flood tunnels the ones long believed to have been constructed centuries ago to protect whatever it is that lies buried on Oak Island if so then the water that came gushing out of the hole would be saltwater from the surrounding ocean it's not that bad that is not so water I heard see if we get David a drink though in forever not according to accounts by previous treasure hunters the water that flooded the money pit in the 19th century was saltwater unlike the fresh groundwater found elsewhere on the island the presence of ocean water gave credibility to stories of a network of booby-trapped flood tunnels which enter the money pit area at various depths and from various directions it is these flood tunnels which when triggered prevent the area around the money pit from being excavated and whatever lies buried at the bottom from being retrieved although tapping into what could be a man-made booby-trap would be an indication that Rick and Craig were on the right track so far as finding the money pit is concerned a non-stop flood of seawater would seriously undermine any progress the team was hoping to make what do you want is that salt our friend tasted it we say it's fresh you - no no let me do the bottle no-no-no that's so let's come on fresh I think it's really a brackish we're braxton truth all in no it's fresh finding French water most likely indicates that Rick and the team may have hit an artesian well one which could pose a significant threat to their drilling efforts the first thing of interest for me is you know the old stories money pit saltwater money pit saltwater the curious thing was it wasn't salty there's probably been an introduction of freshwater into that system so it's one more complexity to the puzzle it's a little disturbing though that there's that amount of freshwater in there I can't explain so as usual one answer to questions [Laughter] while the drilling process continues back at the money pit site Craig tester meets with Marty to give him an update on the day's progress Murray I was drilling going well it's going slow it's frustrating it was he making progress yeah he's making progress I mean the actual drilling it's very quick really twenty feet yes but he's not having the same troubles that the other guy had no he's got enough pump plenty long it's got plenty of power it's just it's frustrating it's not you want to tell you what Craig it's expensive to you know how much is the all release for that rig and we've been out here now we drilled two holes looking for the Halifax tunnel didn't find anything now we're drilling in the money pit I mean at some point we all have to be thinking you know when it when does enough become enough right yeah I mean I don't burn in money at a pretty good rate we need to break through I guess you know if you look at this year's efforts it's been it's been disappointing we we got some teasers I guess we just need to you need to fight that vault all right well you know what in for penny came for bone let's keep going for a while and see what happens definitely all right good I want to work through some more figures then I'll join you out there okay deal make some hole Craig okay see ya okay for Marty lagina his brothers determination to pursue multiple theories and search in more than one area at a time may have increased the team's chances for success but they have also put a strain on the already limited number of days the team could all be together on the island this is an expensive venture we have a lot of money in this all of us not just me Craig Rick and expenses continue to add up so at some point the money will matter at some point we have to look at the bottom line and say this is still worth it coming up if his concrete Rick concrete wood that's the description that's what they found at the top of the wall back at the money pit site progress is finally being made the 30-ton drilling rig has been stabilized and the drill bits have proved powerful enough to move past layers of debris and reach the team's target depth of 140 feet if Craig testers calculations are correct the team could find themselves within a few feet of the original money pit and possibly the mysterious wooden object known as the Chappell vault it's taking a long time to get to 140-foot level but now ready to start taking some split-spoon samples okay yeah let's do it the process is a relatively simple one first Jordan Rogers of Valley well drillers begins mounting a two-foot coring head once deployed the drill will insert a steel casing into the 140 foot hole to keep it from collapsing then a two-foot-long hollow coin bit otherwise known as a split spoon sampler will extract a sample of earth along with any other objects present if the split spoon can retrieve any artifacts that can be dated to before 1795 then the laginas and their team will have found the money pit at this point it just comes down to luck did we pick the right spot is there something there and how far are we gonna penetrate into so that begs the question why are we here however finding it right there we're just waiting for the split spoon and it has to come out of that hole in finally maybe we can get some information up till now it's just been a it's been a real money pit that's not good it's gonna go up sloppy wet yeah we're not gonna get a song before well he's got a slurry up to where its ports are above it the car could still be perfectly fine we'll see we're gonna fall barrel yeah it is a suspense-filled moment for the Oak Island team will the core sample containing materials from 140 feet deep underground indicate that they are close to finding the original Oak Island money pit Oh that's amazing screwdriver definitely got wood for my nap be nice to know what that is what speeches it would is yeah there we go he's coming slowly that's deadly that's what they found at the top of the wall thank God bedrock right there I don't think that's bedrock pavers concrete Rick that is a possibility concrete and then wood that's the description concrete and wood have Rick Craig and Dave not only located the original money pit but also the mysterious Chappell vault the one first discovered by William Chappell more than 100 years ago well if this is a side piece or we're coming right down the side of it but like you said why is this turn this at the top here's the top this is sitting on top of this beam we cut through that right into the side I mean it makes sense according to historical records the strange wooden vault William Chappell and his team discovered measured seven feet high with seven-inch thick walls it was covered by a mixture of clay and sand that looked like cement which laboratory tests conducted at the time determined to have been worked by man that is curious the two different orientations of the wood it's curious that this is old instincts have Rick Craig and the Oak Island team really taken a core sample from the legendary Chappell vault and if so what might they discover inside it pirate treasure rare manuscripts precious religious artifacts is the Oak Island team really on the threshold of solving this 200 year old mystery when the first split spoon came up initially its Wow you know there's a wall factor to it because we all see clay and we see what might be construed as poor cement and then there's horizontal wouldn't then there's vertical wood well we were basically looking at the description from 1897 right there in front of our faces but we should take this to my brother yeah absolutely let's get the truck and go okay coming out that's the top of the wall looks like we might have been right this is the core that's the first course is the core do you think you're on the vault I know my brother is skeptical he's done this before I need proof rings booth Rick lagina Craig tester and Dave Blankenship may have just made one of the most momentous discoveries in the history of Oak Island they may have found not only the original money pit but also a mysterious wooden vault not located in more than a century okay let's surprise the hell out of them Artie trigger they doing good Rick was right for y'all surprise for you don't say anything till you look at it okay this is the core this the first course is the core which was down the top this is about from where what depth 140 feet 142 so look like concrete in it it does look like concrete yep you're right the odds-on is that that is cement yeah that's you know like the top of a wood vault is that what you're thinking yeah why the grains running the opposite ways through top side great we're coming right down the side based on the alignment of the wood grain found in the core sample the team believes they didn't simply find a piece of milled wood from the top of the wooden vault but from a portion of both the top where the grain would run horizontally and the side where the grain would run vertically in other words they get the equivalent of a bull's-eye does it say what the official appearance of it was yeah clay cement wood I mean it's amazing that's exactly what was described in 1897 where they got the piece of parchment ostensibly the gold chain - right and they describe that to a tee clay cement wood and I think wow geez Craig you nailed it this is great guys I guess you couldn't ask for any better he got cement wood fibers running this way wood fibers running that way right everybody since 1897 when that vault was first found has been trying to refine this and nobody has found it Craig for the first time I've ever seen him is over the moon about this and I know my brother skeptically Lee he's done this before I cannae brutha need proof I need proof we were just on the very edge if we're on the outside you know this is classic Oak Island right we're gonna drill another one army which way all four ways all six ways where any bets next two feet shiny golden and you clearly shortly after finding the cement-covered wooden vault in 1897 William Chappell and his colleagues continued drilling additional core samples upon reaching a depth of 100 feet they were stopped by what they believed to be a large heavy metal object located directly beneath the mysterious wood involved could it have been a second treasure site one that's contents were considered so priceless or so dangerous that it had be encased in metal the treasure hunters would never know because before they could excavate the site the flooded with seawater from what appeared to be yet another underground booby trap the gigantic hole was filled in and William Chappell and his colleagues went home empty-handed okay let's go get us another court right away yep let's go we should take this to dance the news that Rick Craig and Dave Blankenship have made an incredible discovery has reenergized the team on Oak Island but did they really find not only the original money pit but also the mysterious Chappell vault I'll go get dad see if he's up so you gotta tell me one thing what why you of all people are that excited cold calculating scientific detached analysis Craig why are you so exciting it fits the story I mean you know I I am a skeptic and many things but and you know we got to see what what Dan says but you know hey Dan we need you to tell us what we found Rick hopefully hope what's that look like dan did a lot of work in the money pit he punched a lot of holes with the old churn drill he has a keen intellect and a keen memory so he brings an asset that we don't have like Rick lagina dan Blankenship has spent nearly 50 years determined to solve the mystery he has spent thousands of hours drilling coring and digging and is met with more than his fair share of setbacks and bad luck for him Oak Island is both an obsession and a curse and obsession to find out what lies buried here and a curse if he should be forced to leave the island empty-handed in the collection core or something you can see some kind of material around it here it's in here we go that's for sure I find that would very interesting because of the difference this is this direction this is that direction you've noticed that I'm sure and this one here is in the vertical yeah up and down [Music] you may have something chapel's long I'm wondering is this the top of the vault and we're hitting the side and we hit a a post on the side if this is chapels vault that's the culmination of some 45 years work you know what your odds are in something I'm after all these many years and so many holes been put down yeah astronomical really well I'll tell you one thing Dan I told you we weren't giving up and we're not gonna give up what he said oh I think you have basis would you call it optimism okay today was a good day on Oak Island information has been gathered and progress has been made but more than that faith has been renewed make some core again bring it up bring it all right for Marty lagina finding the money pit means that all the years of hard work and the millions of dollars spent so far may all have been worth it it's the encouragement we needed again it always seems to happen on this bloody Island you know what's the time you're in the pits and you're ready to give up and say let's go home something happens to get you wired back in the time will tell but I think this is a small victory for Rick it means that the 50 years he spent believing in a dream may not have been in vain hopefully when the next one comes up we'll have something to look at it's always been my hope and my dream to be successful best-case scenario as to what's down there is we actually following the original money pit that's incredible we've moved the dial then on the Oak Island history so I'm excited about that but also to see what own eyes that those old stories are real but now there is much more work to do finding the money pit is one thing reaching and retrieving whatever lies at the bottom is quite another and what will the laginas and their partners ultimately find an underground treasure vault chests of gold priceless objects and sacred artifacts or will it be something so incredible and so powerful that the elaborate way in which it was hidden was meant to be taken as a warning ready here we go next time on the curse of Oak Island there we go tell them what we're on the side something we need to figure the best way to take a look at that cipher is the instruction on how to stop the flood traps I still think the swamp has something to tell us x marks the spot we found another coin it could be very significant looks like we've definitely got something looks like it's Knights Templar cross right now this ends right here Subtitled by Diego Moraes www.oakisland.tk
