 Tonight on the curse of Oak Island the first time somebody's gonna go down in 10x and actually go into the cavern what do you think is down at the bottom two chests and one body it's the first look we have a tenant according to legend seven people need to die and I'm not gonna be number seven we're not gonna get somebody killed in that hole Rick or I should go with there is an island in the North Atlantic

 where men have been looking for treasure for more than 200 years so far they have uncovered tunnels booby-traps carved stones with strange symbols a 17th century pirate treasure coin even evidence of a wooden vault six men have even lost their lives trying to solve the mystery according to legend one more will have to die before the treasure can be found let's do this it is another day on Oak Island no no no we're on the ladder a day that will directly connect the

 islands past with its future after locating the original money pit earlier this year Marty and Rick lagina have hatched a bold plan they will attempt to send a pair of divers down to the bottom of borehole 10-x in hopes that they can find what dan Blankenship insists he saw when he dug the 235-foot shaft more than 40 years ago a man-made tunnel leading to the money pit but first Rick lagina must clear the entrance of any rusted metal or other debris that could break off and cause serious damage it is a dangerous operation the metal casings that line the shaft are more than 40 years old and more seriously corroded than anyone anticipated you gotta watch we're catching up on okay let's go up what began as a simple plan to ensure safety has become extremely dangerous like most things on Oak Island if something can go wrong it probably will the section of ladder is much heavier than Rick anticipated now he has to figure out how to safely remove it from the shaft come here you little thing hang on one second don't you all right bring me up a close call but for Rick lagina it wasn't nearly close enough for him to call it quits who's happy damn thing wouldn't cut well I didn't say it was gonna be easy down there knowing you were right going down tell you one thing I was always impressed that you and your father Dan did this but I'm even more impressed I learned my lesson but all the while no matter what I was doing down there I was constantly thinking what needs doing must be done in order to get the answers and so we will now as they wait for the dive team to arrive Rick Dan and Dave Blankenship and Jack Begley gather in the war room they have scheduled the teleconference with Marty and Craig tester who are in Traverse City Michigan and who claimed to have some exciting information to share with them I am Marty okay so you've got test results for us right 1450 and 1640 before I like that earlier this year diver Tony Sampson pulled a large hardwood tree stump out of the Oak Island swamp if as the data indicates the stump was growing sometime between 1450 and 1640 ad then it would help the team pinpoint the date the swamp was created and when a possible treasure could have been buried on the island that's impressive what about the muddy pit core that we drilled out what about that both pieces of wood analyzed the one the horizontal piece that came on the core and the vertical piece and they're both coming about the same time range 1665 to the 1900s 1665 to 1900 if the results of the carbon-dating are correct it means the so-called Chappell vault could be anything from a 17th century treasure vault to the remains of a 19th century searcher tunnel and unfortunately it's a huge range original people could've been surges 1690 is old enough for some theories but it doesn't fit at all with the coconut fiber age or some of the other things that are much more ancient so I think the frustration is that the your puzzle pieces don't fit right no no's particularly do not fit no so what is it Dundee or 95% belief I would say drop down from there multiple times according to researchers it is entirely possible that folk Island was known as a repository for gold treasure and other valuables as far back as the 14th century this may have been due in part to the islands strategic placement off the Nova Scotia coast near the principal Atlantic sea lanes in 1897 shortly after finding the wooden vault William Chappell kept drilling at a depth of 171 feet his it what he described as an iron plate one that the drill bit could not penetrate could this have been another even older treasure vault one buried centuries before coming up what do you think is down at the bottom two chests and one body unknowns we're gonna make it dangerous according to the legend seven people need to die and I'm not gonna be number seven before members of his team attempt to dive to the bottom of 10-x author and treasure hunter J Hutton Pulitzer has returned to Oak Island he is here along with Dave Blankenship to make a few last-minute modifications to the diving platform Rick and the team recently constructed what I want to do is reinforce this let's grab our screws and screw gun and I'm gonna pull off a couple pieces here and we'll just start putting braces on earlier this summer Pulitzer came to the island and shared his theory that the Oak Island mystery dates back much earlier than most researchers believe there is an ancient legend about an Ancient Mariner society traveling from the Holy Land to Nova Scotia with the Ark of the Covenant here we talk about 582 to 596 BC when Hutton learned of the laginas plan to have experienced divers try and get to the bottom of 10x he recommended a team he has worked with for several years so now I got a base to work for them to put up video and comms here okay thanks oh and watch the team what's the story of the one diver I know one diver came close to dying in this what happened his divemaster we didn't read his chart breakers in 1993 veteran Oak Island treasure hunter dan Blankenship hired a diver to repeat the dive Dan himself had done several times during the 1970s he wanted to confirm that would he believe he saw in the frigid darkness 235 feet underground was still there things like wooden posts antique tools chests and even the remains of a dead body but when the diver Dan hired attempted the dive everything went terribly wrong he lost but to go below 200 feet and he went to 235 and he was down there for probably about 15-20 minutes although the diver was able to reach the bottom visibility was virtually zero he could not see or photograph anything he also attempted to ascend to the surface much too fast and in doing so nearly became the seventh casualty of the infamous Oak Island curse so he had a serious decompression issue yeah and he didn't know it no and he came straight to the surface of yep decompression sickness also known as the bends could pose a serious threat to the divers in 10x it occurs when gases like nitrogen become highly compressed in the body when a diver is underwater when they rise to the surface they must do so in short stages allowing their body to decompress failing to do so can cause the gases to expand and form bubbles in the bloodstream this in turn leads to intense joint pain vertigo seizures and in some cases death we went back in the decompression game about four times he's lucky he's lucky he didn't die yeah [Music] now we got us a crow's nest and we're lined right up over it good thank you sir no problem shortly after returning to Oak Island from Michigan Marty and Craig tester have joined Rick and other members of the team for a meeting with J Hutton Pulitzer and diver Dan misiaszek gentlemen we've got some exciting stuff to get prepared for we are going to get to the bottom of 10x it looks like we're gonna do it with the help of these people want to introduce you you've already met Hutton this is Dan dan is a professional diver technical diver Dan misiaszek also known as frog is a former US Army infantryman and police officer he has died all over the world in the most dangerous environments from open water to underwater caves what we really want to do like my brother just said is we want to get to the bottom of 10x and so these are the three gentlemen who built 10x Dan designed it and David and Dan worked in that chamber dan was down in dive she's dive suit several times sir how many times were you in the 27-inch dent too many about a dozen well obviously it's a good design because you came back here let me show you something the equipment looks something like that look at that that's him going down the 27-inch first dive was probably in 74 75 one of Dan's dives in 1976 convinced him to widen 10-x from 27 inches to the gaping 8-foot diameter hole it is today dan was down there in the 27-inch he's in a saddle they had lowered and thought they were torching holes in the side to figure out if they had gone past voids when they were driving the casing down is they suspected at 140 and 165 that there might be a side tunnel suddenly as Dan was being lowered 150 feet down into the shaft on an electric hoist pressure from one of the supposed flood tunnels made the borehole begin to collapse above his head operating the hoist at the surface was his son Dave who could hear his father's desperate calls for help over the radio acting quickly Dave got his father up above the area of the collapse just in time five seconds later and Dan would have become the islands seventh victim to ensure something like this would never happen again dan dave and dan henskee spent the next several years widening the shaft to eight feet down to a depth of 181 feet they then reinforced the shaft with concrete for 90 feet and then stacked the bodies of three hollowed-out railway tanker cars all the way up to the surface unfortunately dan ran out of money to finish the project leaving the hall from 181 feet to the cavern at 235 feet only 27 inches wide [Music] here's our plan to make this as safe as possible before we put any diver in the hall we're deploying a special type of sonar for the first time 10x is gonna be mapped in super-high detail in hi-def so it's gonna tell us exactly what's down there so we know what we're dealing with so the thousand-dollar question is what do you think is down at the bottom I thought I saw two chests down there and I saw a post that supposedly was left by the original people and one body divers beware well we all know the history of this Oak Island we know how many people have died here and according to the legend seven people need to die and I'm not gonna be number seven if it's clear if frog can get through we want to put human eyes in the cavern and hopefully put our hands on something enough talk action [Music] hey guys they're bringing it up scans you all here to looker we're gonna be I'm gonna be able to see very good detail radar goes around and all of a sudden it's the first block we have if today isn't one of the biggest days in the 220-year search for treasure on Oak Island it will certainly be one of the most dangerous after days of planning and preparation Rick and Marty lagina have invited two of the world's most experienced divers to the island to dive to the bottom of 10x if all goes according to plan they will be the first people in more than 20 years to risk a descent into the 235-foot deep shaft but if they make it down there will they find what Oak Island treasure hunter dan Blankenship claims he saw more than 40 years ago ancient tools boat chests filled with pirate gold a dead body or will they find an underground chamber one which leads directly into the money pit jump up there hook hook the basket up because the latter in 10x needed to be removed for safety reasons Rick and Marty have arranged for the divers to each be lowered into 10x using a steel bucket suspended from a boom truck safety is paramount in putting people at risk people we don't know people who are willing to you know quite literally endanger themselves to achieve the goal which is to get into the cavity and find out information so we've provided them with two boom trucks one to insert dive teams into the hole any other in case of catastrophic failure there's another boom truck available to extract the divers yeah we're just doing final assembly right now and then we're gonna go through our checklist which is quite extensive we do this every time because it's it's too vital okay one misstep here and could be fatal on water could be failed dan and Kathy misiaszek are former police officers and professional search and rescue divers over the years they have conducted dozens of dives together recovering everything from objects and artifacts to human remains this is capper this is back up in safety and triage in addition to Dan and Kathy Hutton has invited John tapper to serve as the backup safety diver it's his job to monitor Dan and Kathy's vital signs and to get them to safety if anything goes wrong this is called a rebreather if this is basically the top of line you can get to rebreathe okay so you're gonna breathe 70% oxygen well it depends on our depth okay so it's a computer sort of deal depending on your breath it's gonna feed you the right moment yeah atmospheric air is mostly made up of nitrogen and oxygen so the divers breathing equipment known as a rebreather must supply the correct mixture of the two gases in order to sustain them underwater too much or too little of either could have deadly consequences nitrogen narcosis taking them on too much nitrogen which is like getting drunk underwater yes when we're adding that much oxygen we're reducing the amount of nitrogen correct I understand that completely but then there's oxygen toxicity too we're gonna keep track of our oxygen toxicity units and there's actually a formula for that oxygen toxicity which could cause seizures and nitrogen narcosis are just two more potential dangers the team were faced these must be the sonar guys hey how's it going guys alright Rick lagina David to help identify any unusual objects that might be found at the bottom of 10x the team has enlisted to help a Brian Abbott and Nick Burchill of Kongsberg maritime a global company that specializes in deep underwater navigation surveying and investigation along with the dive team they're bringing in a scan team what's been thrown in that hole what's down that hole how might that endanger them so that's why we need to insert that scanning equipment okay so debris is the issue I'm good to look are we gonna get at that well this is an excellent sonar because it's got different frequencies so we're gonna be able to see some very good detail then if there's piping or debris or cables that stuff we'll be able to see that when we put the sonar down there modifying that taser yeah the ms1000 scanning sonar device works by sending out fan-shaped pulses of sound waves if all goes well it will generate a computerized picture of the interior of 10x all the way from the top of the shaft to the bottom 235 feet below the surface okay guys y'all ready Nick you ready having your a boy yeah we're ready awesome let's get going through it Brian Abbott is a leading expert in using this device and devices like them he worked getting sonar images on the Titanic okay heads up behind you it's not very heavy what we're doing we got the transducer going south here and we're gonna scan up and down in this shot it'll help with the diet because we can visualize the conditions in the big part of 10x the eight-foot diameter part and we can also hopefully if we can get that camera in there visualize the conditions in the 27-inch hole that then goes down to the chamber you know deploy to what 110 110 okay okay that's where it's 60 just come up at 80 90 come down to 100 you add it secur okay I'm secure over here it's great that we'll get the sonar up and start getting an image the radar goes around and all of a sudden this picture materializes on the screen and it's the first look we have at 10x okay so what I'm seeing on the bottom that's shown up nice and white that's debris that's the bottom yeah down here's the debris so we're looking at 4.1 feet roughly so we have over four feet of debris burden at this location yeah according to Brian Abbott there is four feet of debris covering the area of 10x that is only 27 inches wide could this mean the dive is over before it even begins coming up right on off the stairs will load you right there for the first time somebody's gonna go down in 10x and actually go into the cavern watch the band what [Music] so we got over four feet of debris burden at this location yeah after a scanning sonar device confirms that over four feet of debris appears to be covering the 27-inch wide hole in borehole 10x Rick and Marty lagina fear the dive they have gone to great trouble and expense to set up could be in jeopardy before it even begins any idea what that would be throw it away I don't know where it's coming from what could have been rigged here that somebody missed that could have fell down in the hall nothing we cleaned the whole bottom of the hole was clean when we left and everything from on top would move once again a well-planned operation on Oak Island is met with a serious challenge there was a bunch of junk on the bottom but they couldn't because of the way that thing focuses they couldn't make out what it was although the scanning sonar device is designed to generate precise images of the objects it scans the debris at the bottom of 10-x appears to be so fine and so dense that it's showing up as a single mass but what is it what is it made of and more importantly can it be removed so what are we doing so let's just scratch this we can't get a look it's just abort test pull it up with wasting time frog flash I need you for a minute J Hutton Pulitzer believes there is only one way to find out what the debris is and hopefully remove it what I'm gonna do is we're just gonna get them suited up and let's go in that's we just need eyes wouldn't agree on cameras and guys on third but again we're trying to we're trying to read this debris but it's not reading very well okay get suited up we're gonna go in alright okay we're gonna be flying blind a little bit but get going in we gotta get eyes on it yeah go ahead dive it's pretty apparent it's the dangerous dive so you're concerned about safety issues and your goal get into the 27-inch and get into the cavity there's danger and everything there's gonna be more danger in going into 10x but there's an objective we're gonna take every reasonable safety precaution because human lives are longer we're gonna have a guy in the surface that's gonna be monitoring the dive also a trained diver who can go in and get these people if they're in trouble we're going to have an EMT team standing by we're not gonna get somebody killed in that hole or injured we got it covered the truth is we ramped up I mean it's exciting look for the first time somebody's gonna go down in 10x and actually go into the cavern if everything goes according to plan divers Dan and Kathy misiaszek should be at the bottom of 10x within the hour but will they see the large wooden boxes and antique tools dan Blankenship claims he saw back in the 1970s or perhaps an actual tunnel leading directly to the money pit stairs will load you right there hey watch your feet due to the amount of gear each diver needs for the operation they will need to be lowered down one at a time frog giggin calm no calm [Applause] okay don't we have calm I don't have comms until we get them both in there's no other way to do it to ensure safety and offer a constant flow of information the communication system or comms will keep the divers in constant touch with each other as well as the team on the surface the divers comms will be tethered by means of a six-foot-long cable while another much longer Cable will run from the divers all the way to the surface this tethered system is considered more reliable than a wireless one but no one will be sure if it's working correctly until both divers are in 10x we're lined up tell me when Marty tell me when we do it clear here okay your left side left side make sure you don't hit the lips he's good okay we're gonna have to pay attention to your left side you gotta look at that riser although you watch you watch the metal you're gonna get down frog right as you get close that riser over there okay problems gonna be watch your hands on that rust watch your hands we got to get a left back in the left he's got a steer himself and all at this point you gotta come off of that channel and spit himself there you go okay frog we got to do our best to keep you left all he's got to do is stay on those ten thirty feet of water watch the band's watch it coming up I'm on the edge of my chair I'm worried I'm a diver myself director I should go with him let's go down let's go down get your take inside your right tanks hanging over the right side the dive down 10x is finally getting underway you got it you're fine but now the team must deal with a major issue watch behind you just I would catch that lip there was very little clearance between the steel cage that diver Dan misiaszek is being lowered in and the rusted metal inside the shaft did you hear him shouldn't you be here what he said let you get on your communication deal I don't have that feel he's hooked in the water mm-hmm he says go because their communication system won't be functional until both divers are in the water 40 feet below J Hutton Pulitzer he's unable to help Dan safely navigate his way down watch it's right there watch the lip on the front hold on hold on we had state-of-the-art communication devices but they couldn't be connected until the divers were in the water so really we had the most primitive of communications going on we had people hollering at each other down a 40-foot hole and there was a lot of hollering going back and forth and not a lot of communication good plus the divers communicating through a mask yes Dave watch a guy now look you got risers underneath you and a cage you see them okay you got let's go down let's go down then you get this issue going on between hot and cold these people are basically frying in their wet suit until they get in the water and then it gets really cold you could tell by the muffled screams get us in the water get us in the water they were they were basically cooking in their own juices okay let's go watch your elbow watch your right elbow clear your right elbow clear it go down he wants to go down let's go down we're going let's go down we're in stop finally after several tense minutes diver Dan misiaszek also known as frog makes it into the water okay come on oh you know it occurs to me we should send a regular person down with them because that person can communicate so much better and spit it Rick or I should go with him Rick is writing down with you will take there's no way to have comms we need a person in the basket cuz you're not connected so Rick's riding with you plus he can spin the basket right because he knows with Rick lagina riding in the cage with Kathy not only will he be able to help keep the cage stable he will also be able to relay any communications to Kathy from the team above okay let's go for me it was easy because you realized that they're about to do what they're gonna do that is dive in there and so you just do what you have to do to alleviate that problem so there's more about them than it was about me okay Dave you need to pull it your way and turn because they were gonna kick those left's otherwise Rick cause he's fearless and when he's on a quest you know he'll do what it takes which way do you want to face Rick towards Dave okay we're twist them this way yep spin him that way perfect right above the Frog coming down water though there's a history of danger associated with 10x lean look Dan almost lost his life twice in that hole and now that danger is magnified in this dive because there's so much equipment things tossed in the ladders rusted broken riser pipes so we have to be very very careful we got a twisted Twitter the slip and clear these tines it's got to go this way this way the tines are okay there you go there you go there you go okay Rach be careful huh yeah we just got to clear these lips we're pushing down I'm worried you know these two people are going into this hole we know it's got hazards in it I'm on the edge of my chair I'm worried I'm a diver myself there are no one hazards and unknown hazards I would have a hard time going in that hole put your hands on the Rings Rick [Music] coming down for the first time in more than 20 years divers are going to attempt a descent to the bottom of 10x if successful they might find everything from ancient tools and treasure chests to man-made tunnels that lead directly to the bottom of the infamous money pit put your hands on the Rings wreck and to make sure diver Cathy mashuk gets into the water safely Rick lagina has volunteered to be lowered down in the steel cage basket with her you gotta move we gotta get him in we gotta get him in okay okay say when don't how much another fourth day the cage must be lowered completely into the water to allow Kathy who goes by the nickname flash to climb out and begin the dive good but to do that means at least for a while Rick will need to also be submerged in water that is only 41 degrees Fahrenheit he has to go down and get dunked in ice-cold water I mean that water it was 40 degrees then he just he went right in up to his neck and I'm worried you know she was cooking a minute ago he's freezing she's not clear yet No I think she's gonna get it here her tamed her tanks looped on that one bar she won't come out her tanks looped over barnacle suit I don't know he came out on the right side he came out on your left he came out backward turn her tanks against the wall okay right there right there right there she's got what's what's holding her up is that side extra tank she's got a push it down push it down you know what we should get rid of wet suit yeah he's gonna freeze okay now she's got to get out and slide to her left there she goes she's cleared you ready to come up somebody get him a towel he's gonna be frozen I didn't really feel the water because I was concentrating on getting them out but then when the water crept up to here I realized just how cold that water was you did a great job that's for damn sure it was 41 degrees that's cold water it's cool water in anybody's book got it we got a feed I've got the videos on I've got I could see flash and yours okay I've got you frog I can see it both now with both divers in the water their comms or communication and video lines can be activated this will allow the team at the surface to stay in constant contact and monitor every second of the dive myself my brother we've put a lot of time and energy into this Island and you know for the first time hopefully we can get real data with highs on target and get information that's been denied everyone for almost 40 years that's pretty exciting stuff for brothers Rick and Marty lagina a 50 year old fascination with the Oak Island mystery has led to an historic moment by sending divers down borehole 10-x they may be on the verge of finding out if there really is something of incredible value buried at the bottom of the money pit but if so what could it be gold and jewels worth millions of dollars priceless religious artifacts ancient documents containing knowledge that has been lost to man for centuries for his 10x simply a trap a trap that will cost the brothers not only their time but possibly someone's life next time on the curse of Oak Island they're in the dark they can see your imagination takes over what's happening down there you staying your fire call the dive all aboard you just came out of the pipe they're doing in the chamber that looks like staff as a chamber yes with man-made ugh get those are boxes what's the thing to the right of it looks very square sure looks like a tunnel it does look man me we found Subtitled by Diego Moraes www.oakisland.tk
