 But we don't think that it was him. Which means that somebody else wants to kill you. Who? Well, far be it from me to say, but... Anyway... [ Inhales sharply ] Any ideas, Mr. Laggat-Brown? [ Slurping ] No. Where were you yesterday, anyway? Flying back from Tenerife. I run a travel company.

 I see. So are you both on the same page regarding dates? Because I gather there was a little bit of a confusion. - We are, yes. - Oh, good. So how did your family make all its wealth, Tiggy? TIGGY: Does it matter? It's just that I heard it was dog food. Chunkies, if I'm not mistaken, Betty. Unless I'm barking up the wrong tree. [ Chuckles ] [ Dinging ] JEREMY: Excuse me. Yes? I'm not massively beholden to my wife at the moment,

 but how is this relevant? My. How chivalrous. I can look after myself, thank you, darling. Excellent! Then I shall leave you be. AGATHA: Ah-ah-ah-ah. Eh... I would like to posit a question, if I may. If something were to happen to your dear wife, God forbid, who would inherit all this fortune? TIGGY: Cassandra would. Lock, stock, and barrel. Now, if you'll excuse me. Darling. [ Door closes ] So, Tiggy, why don't you like being reminded of where all this wealth came from? It's dog food. Who cares? I hate it. I'm ashamed. Dog food. Oh, yes, I see. Yeah, I don't think it would go down very well with the ladies that lunch at the country club. - Is that right? - I'd be the laughingstock. What about Jeremy? Does he like playing king of the castle, hmm? He doesn't care. He's never been interested in money. He used to be interested in me. But you still love him, right? So why make the arrangements for Cassandra's engagement party without him? What was all that about? A ploy. To get his attention. Ah. CASSANDRA: I said to her, I said, "Tilly, don't waste your time." You know when you know, don't you? Actually, don't answer that, because your taste in men is even worse than the taste of that black tomato gin we had that time. - [ Car approaches, stops ] - Ha! When are you gonna meet someone? - [ Car door closes ] - When the time's right. There's no rush. Plus, I have Comet. We both have. Oh, you won't forget that Baron needs mucking out too, will you? Course not. - [ Horse neighing ] - Hi, Cassie. Hey, Fliss. How's it going? Charles! Hi. Great. How are you? Good, good. Wow. It takes me back, seeing Comet. All of us hacking out across the fields. And you and Cassie are still close? Uh, yeah. Not as close. She's more into parties and moving to London. And I'm more into this. But she mucks out occasionally when I'm away. Listen, I hope you don't mind me asking, but... Do you know of any reason why anyone would hold a grudge against Tiggy? Tig? No. Envy, maybe? She's rich and beautiful. Excellent. Yes. Thursday, then. Very good. Hi. - Hi. - Fliss. Hi. I just thought I'd, um, take Comet out. Sure. Well, I'll leave you to it. Marital strife isn't reason enough alone to kill. Isn't it? Are you sure? Well, not unless there's a motive. Are you coming in or what? No, I promised Roy that I would find him a pub with a roaring fire and a Spanish barman. Otherwise he may end up back at yours. Apparently he's worried about the drafts. Yes, he did mention that. Toodle-oo. TONI: [ Calling ] Red? What are you doing? I thought you were back at the office. Well, um, I've had a couple of sightings, near Herris Cum Magna, actually, so I thought I'd take a look. Oh, good. Well, off you pop, then. [ Blows whistle ] Any possibility of a lift? Excuse me! Who do you think I am, your chauffeur? Go on. All right. [ Sighs ] Let's get sorted. [ Keys clink ] Gonna have a drink first. Aaaaah! WILKES: Well, well, well. - [ Beep, camera shutter clicks ] - So, what have we got here? BILL: He's been I.D.ed as Johnny Sullivan. Another note, a gun, and a cake. It could be a heart attack? Yeah, yeah, details, Constable, details. I'm thinking this is a hybrid cake... A touch of red velvet and a little hint of walnut. Now, the flavors will be great, but it's been overmixed. That icing looks delicious. But the bottom? Bit soggy. So here's a thought. I mean, I'm just thinking out loud here. What if the death wasn't natural causes, and what if the actual real-life cake itself was poisoned? [ Chuckles ] Utter lunacy. - [ Gasps ] - Uh... Best not. Shall we leave the master baker to it? Definitely soggy. [ Police radio chatter ] - What's happening? - Oh, James. You're back. - So soon? - My meeting was canceled. Or rather it never existed. So someone wanted him out of the house and out of the way. What are you talk... Will you just tell me what's going on? There has been a bit of an incident involving a dodgy cake and a dead assassin in the kitchen. - What?! - Nothing I can't handle. Bill, can you fill him in? I just need to find out a little bit more about this Sullivan character. [ Whistle blowing ] TONI: Red! Red! [ Woman crying ] [ Door closes ] TONI: Emma Comfrey. Oh, excellent work. Is Charles with you? They're following Perry Peterson. Well, I sincerely hope he hasn't spotted you. God, no, Aggie. He hasn't got a clue. Red! Red? [ Clinking ] [ Whistles ] Come on, Red! [ Whistles ] [ Whistling ] Red! - James! - Sorry! Sorry. [ Sighs ] Look, here's a thought. Why don't we go out and do some digging? What? Now? It's what you do. And it's kind of what we do. It's sort of the only thing we do together. Well, apart from occasionally... Well, yeah. Occasionally. [ Chuckles ] What? James, there is really no need to go out and do any kind of digging right now. Charles and Roy have everything covered. [ Knock on door ] Evening. Oh. It would appear my shop is never shut. Listen, even Toni's hard at it. She's, hopefully, in the woods, getting lucky somewhere. Is she? She also called me to say that she saw Emma Comfrey leaving George's house in something of a state, which is interesting. And thanks to my research, I think I may have discovered that our suicide-note writer may have been left-handed. What have you got? Well, Johnny Sullivan died as a result of a heart attack brought on by an allergic reaction to Cascaden. To what? What is that, some sort of Amazonian poison or something? It's a laxative, actually. James, can you just be serious for a minute? He's right. It is a laxative. And it was all over that cake. But why? Well, to debilitate me, obviously. Someone is trying to hamper this case. [ Exhales sharply ] But how did this cake crusader get in here? That's what I want to know. [ Sighs ] So someone sets up your fake meeting assuming that you will come back here to get changed. So you come back here, you go up the stairs, they sneak in... Did you leave the door open again? No. I'd have spotted a cake on the kitchen table, Agatha. Not if they waited till you'd left. Who would want you off the investigation? What, apart from Wilkes? Oh, let me think. Mmmm, pretty much everyone. BILL: Well, someone else did break in, 'cause your back door was picked by a pro. Sullivan? Let himself in, waits, eats the cake intended for you, and... JAMES: Hang on a minute. So you're saying that there's not one but two people who have got it in for Agatha? Precisely that, yeah. This gets better and better. And there's something else. You were right. Sullivan went down a few times, and guess who he once shared a cell with. Don't tell me. Harrison Peterson. In one. And now they're both dead. - Here you go. - Thanks. Well done. Good work, my man. You'll ace it. So, where's Cassie tonight? Uh, she's figuring out which spa treatment to have with her mum tomorrow. - Anyway, I-I best be off. - Oh, no. Ochos. - Ochos? - Ochos. We have to practice your back ochos. Not to mention your parallel and cross systems. Oh, crumbs. Don't worry. Breathe through it. In that case, if we're stopping, your dad was in prison with Johnny Sullivan. You didn't perchance know him, did you? Oh, I knew of him. Yeah, my dad loved telling stories about Johnny. To anyone who would listen, really. - Why? - He's dead. Anyone else like hearing those stories? 'Cause I know a couple of people that would love to... No one. No. Listen, thanks for this. Really. But I best be going. Bye. Red?! Thought you might like some company. Ohh! You thought right. I don't really know what I'm doing, really. I don't know why I keep getting fobbed off with the missing-pet stuff when Agatha gets all the glory. Or flak, to be fair. But I know what you mean. I get the short straw the whole time. From Wilkes and Agatha. And I don't even work for her. So how are we doing on old Red? Not a clue. I mean, the map shows that he's kind of heading this way, hence the stakeout, but... There's nothing around here for miles except woodland. I know. I don't know where he's heading but it definitely ain't home. The only place near here is the manor house. You know Agatha rates you, right? She said that? - No! Course not. It's Agatha. - Oh. But she wouldn't give you the responsibility if she didn't think you could handle it. And for what it's worth, I'm really impressed by all this. Don't be soft. I mean, what about you? Have you ever thought about moving up the ladder? Do you fancy yourself a sergeant? Can't say I have, really. Why not? You'd ace it. Do you think? Yeah. [ Cellphone vibrates ] - [ Vibrating continues ] - [ Groans softly ] Ohh! What? By all that is fair and good and just in this world, Aggie, please let me come and stay at yours. - I am so bored. - Roy, it's... [ Groans ] It's the middle of the night. I am in bed. Hey, I hope you're still on Perry's tail. What? Who? No, he left. And before you have a dicky fit, we asked him about Sullivan. He knew of him, but he seemed genuinely shocked when he heard that he'd died. He could be pretending. He clammed up when we asked him if anyone else knew. Like he was covering. Our money is on his lovely Cassandra, who, by the way, is gonna be at the spa tomorrow. Ooh! And she will inherit everything if Tiggy dies. On point, she could have hired a hit man and wasn't necessarily a fan of her father-in-law. Food for thought. Sleep well. Oh, I'll sleep well. I'll sleep like a ba... Wake up every two hours, crying. I've won. Shall we? What happened to that Spanish barman you promised me? It's his night off. I'm gonna stay by the fire. Roy, Barfield has 67 rooms. It has very expensive oil-fired heating which I never turn on after February. You need to grow a pair. I have a perfectly adequate pair, thank you very much. They just disappear inside my body when it goes below freezing. Well, I don't feel the cold there at all. Probably something to do with going to public school. It toughens you up. That's what you need. I don't want to go to public school. I want to stay by the fire. Fine. Another game? I'm gonna say "domi-nope." I don't think I could cope with the excitement. Me neither. Well, look, if we're gonna sit here all night, let's at least make it a little more interesting. How about a drinking game? Involving what, exactly? - Tequila. - Oh! I'm in. All the tequila, please. [ Exhales sharply ] - James! - Huh?! What?! What? I've got a theory! Well, not a theory as such. More of a sort of a just like a hunch. No, not a hunch. Like a sort of a something in my stomach. - Wind? - No, not wind. James, it's about romance and... And tango... Agatha, it's late. You need to sleep. [ Exhales sharply ] I need to sleep. I need to sleep. No, but you know what they say... Go to sleep on a problem, waking up with a solution. I'll go to sleep. Okay, so you woke me up to tell me that you're going to sleep? Thanks for that. Sorry about the books. Don't be. It's what you do. You've been busy with your book. It's what you're passionate about. - Passion! - Aah! Aah! This is what I'm talking about! James! Passion! Passion! Passion! That's what this is all about! It's, uh... James! [ Owl hooting ] Can you turn me on? - [ Beeps ] - There you go. Oh! Heeey! Yeah! It's good. [ Whistles ] TONI: [ Whistles ] It's technical. [ Whistling ] Red? Where are you? Bill! Focus. How do you focus? - Oh, there you are. - [ Whistling ] Red?! [ Whistling ] BILL: Red! - [ Horse neighs ] - Bill! It's an expensive bit of kit, this. BILL: [ Panting ] [ Cellphone rings ] I always get the bottom bunk. [ Ringing continues ] Yello. Passion, Roy. Passion. Not now, Aggie. No, I am telling you, that is the key. All that emotion all bubbling away underneath the surface. Anyway, how's it all going at Chez Fraith? Oh, it's five-star. It's brilliant. Good. Very happy for you. Right, listen, this is the plan. I'm gonna go to the spa with my secret weapon and find out what Cassandra knows about Johnny. And I want you and Charles to go and see Mr. Tango Man, see what's really going on between him and Emma whatsit. - Well, how will we do that? - Well, I don't know. I mean, I'm sure Charles will think of something. They're old muckers, weren't they? They went to school together. Probably did initiation ceremonies together. All that dipping-their-testicles- in-a-bottle-of-ink stuff. Oh, yuck, no. Roy? Are you still there? Oh! WOMAN: I think it's the essential oils... AGATHA: A horse?! A hor... What's a horse got to do with anything? Toni, are you on drugs? [ Sighs ] Yes, all right. Well, I have to go. Call me when you find out something more, and not before. Okay? [ Sighs ] Okay, I'm gonna get busy with Tiggy. You get involved with little miss princess, see what she knows about Johnny Sullivan. Johnny Sullivan, okay. What makes you think she'll talk to me? Hmm? Sarah, people just do. I don't know, it's... It's your superpower. Ohh! [ Laughs ] What are the chances? Fancy seeing you here! George's love life? What makes Aggie think he's gonna spill to me? Old mates from boarding school. Soggy biscuit and all that. Old boarding-school mates, soggy biscuit or no, don't spill to each other. That's the whole point. Don't shoot the messenger. That's what she said. She seems to think that your ball bags have crossed at some point over a bottle of ink. She said what?! Oh. Hang on a minute. Now you come to mention it... Charles, are you eating birdseed? It's very good. So are you ready for the big night? CASSANDRA: I'm ready as I'll ever be. Shame about Perry's dad. It is. I would have liked him to be there. I only met him once. We all had dinner together. Did he happen to mention a Johnny Sullivan? Ow! Oh, God, yeah. Went on about him loads. Great stories. Although maybe he went on about him a bit too much. Oh, in what way? Well, Mum and Dad were there, and Mum really didn't appreciate the crime stories and prison talk. She can be a bit judgmental. She was pretty horrid to Harrison. Oh, maybe she wasn't feeling that great. How was Perry about that? Well, Perry doesn't have a bad bone in his body. He just sucked it up. As did his dad. - My dad was furious. - With your mum? Told her she was being well out of order. They had a huge row. We had to leave the restaurant. - Oh, I see. - Mm. And that was the only time you met Perry's dad? Me, yeah. My dad felt so bad about it he went to build bridges. Morning, Charles. All set for the class? I added an extra one in preparation for tonight's show. But we're not in it. Agatha is, and I'm sure she'd appreciate your support. Well, we'll... we'll see. Um, actually, I need to have a word alone, old boy, if that's... - Yeah, of course. - Of course. Take as long as you need. A week to 10 days should do it. George, I need to ask you something. We go back a long way, don't we? And some. Thing is, this is... This is rather delicate. You'll never guess, but... After all these years... ...I've gone and fallen head over heels in love. Frisky Fraith?! Frisky Fraith indeed. In love? I don't believe it. Who on earth brought you to your knees? Well, that's just it, you see. It's, um... You see, I don't want to step on anybody's toes, so I need to make sure that you're okay with it. Me? Why me? It's Emma. [ Door opens, closes ] So Jeremy Laggat-Brown bonded with Perry's dad. That's my understanding. Perhaps... Wha! [ Gasps ] Perhaps he got to this Johnny Sullivan through... through him? - [ Gasping ] - But w-why? Because... ...Jeremy doesn't get a p-p-penny if his w-w-wife dies. [ Groans softly ] Sarah. Are you still alive? Yeah. [ Groaning ] [ Moan echoes ] GEORGE: From here we have out, together, out, together. We turn, the lady goes back on her right... On duty, I take it. No, uh, off, actually. - Very nice. - Oh, thank you. GEORGE: We go back. We push her leg out and to the side. Same leg. And together. We push back. Push her leg out, same leg, and together. Then we just present the lady. - And leg up. - [ Door opens ] AGATHA: Sorry I'm late. Brain freeze, quite literally. Tango practica, Agatha. Boleos and sacadas. Beg your pardon? Boleos... leg wraps... And leg separation... Sacadas. It's very tricky learning these signals that lead into each move. Isn't it just? What did you get on George and Emma? Well... Okay, everyone, let's go. Music! Ask Roy. [ Tango plays ] Okay, mister, spill. I can't really talk right now, Aggie. - I'm practicing my footwork. - Now! Okay, well, basically, madly in love with... Who is? Remember, Mrs. Raisin, in Argentine tango, men lead, women follow. Pbbbb! I've never followed a man in my life, and I am not going to start now. - Who's in love with who? - Emma loves George. He knows it and likes her but can't get over the death of his wife. Apparently, it began with Emma baking him cakes and then moved on to the dance classes. She's becoming ever more possessive. Agatha. How nice. How nice indeed. At yesterday's tango class, you danced quite a bit with Emma. Did you mention your book perchance? I might have. - Oh! - Oh? How fortuitous that I'm dancing with you. Because I would like to ask your advice. You know that I'm doing this rather wonderful dance with Gorgeous George. Well, I just wondered, when he has me in hold, whether it's important to stand up to him or whether I should be submissive and just, you know, melt into his arms? Passive, powerless, yielding. What do you think? Anything? Nothing? It was just a thought. - Aaah! - [ People gasping ] CHARLES: James... [ Down-tempo music plays ] James... [ Squeaking ] It's very sore. Why did you try and poison me? Because you're the image of her. Of Helen. I can see it every time he looks at you, and I... I can't stand it! I'm really sorry, but I think I'm gonna have to arrest you. Okay. Okay. So Emma called my publisher and lured me out of town? Mm-hmm. Before baking me a cake and adding a special little ingredient in the hope that it would stop me dancing. Well, the dagger could have done that for you. If it had been real. Who says chivalry's dead, eh? Must be in the blood. She had no idea about Sullivan's death and is mortified that she triggered it. Well, I should be grateful really, because, in effect, that cake saved my life. Shame about that. Oh, don't sound too disappointed. We still need to look into Jeremy Laggat-Brown's movements, whether he was abroad when he said he was. Think you could maybe help with that? No. That's police business, and... - [ Gut rumbles ] - Oh, God. And we're already onto it. Oh, I've got to go. The icing on that cake looked so good I had to have a little nibble. Oh, God. Police business. Coming through. I'm so sorry. I had no idea Emma would go that far just to stop me dancing with someone else. Well, it's a crazy little thing called love. And she knew that I reminded you of Helen. And you do. Helen loved tango, but we never learned, so I never got to dance with her. I took up dancing as a way of handling my grief. Handling it? Or burying it? Helen was my everything. I'm sure she was, but, I don't know, maybe... Just maybe it's time to move forward. I think maybe Emma could do with your help right now. And maybe even your daughter. Felicity's fine. She coped okay. As long as she has Comet and the manor house, she's okay. Okay. Hey, um, you love horses, don't you? Yeah. Love all animals. How is this fella? Oh, he's a gorgeous boy. Good as ever. He must be pretty tired, though. I mean, going out twice yesterday. Sorry, I don't follow. Well, Charles told me that Jeremy took him out in the afternoon. And then you took him out in the evening. It was you, wasn't it? And even though Comet no longer belongs to you. Oh, nobody owns Comet. He's his own man. And Tiggy doesn't mind so long as he's well looked after. Even in the middle of the night? Sure. I couldn't sleep. And Dad was out rehearsing, as he does. So are we all set on the plan? Yep. Okay, go! [ Up-tempo tango plays ] Oh! Ha. Surprise! What are you lot doing here? ROY: We're the talent. Well, some of us are, anyway. [ Laughs ] No, we are part of the lovely Cassandra's tango extravaganza. We're rehearsing. This way. AGATHA: In fact, could I have a moment of your time? Yes, yes, yes, but just make it quick. In a flash. - Oh, I'm sorry! - JEREMY: You watch it. [ Coughs ] So tell me, how did you get on with Perry's dad? Didn't know him very well at all. Oh? Well, that's odd because Cassandra told me that, uh, you had gone to see him after your wife humiliated him about all the Johnny Sullivan stories. MAN: Signature, sir? Go, go, go, go, go. It seemed like the decent thing to do. Oh. What about Sullivan? Did you meet him too? No. Well, that's odd because he was at my cottage waiting for me with a gun. JEREMY: Good God! I'm sorry, I fail to see a connection. - He's dead. - [ Gasps ] So whoever paid him has, quite frankly, wasted their money. - Yeah. - [ Cellphone rings ] ROY: Sorry again. I didn't mean to... I hope you're going to be better than this tonight. Excuse me. Yes? [ Music stops ] ROY: He's gone. Well, he wasn't lying. He was out the country two days ago. Really? Where? The Camar... Cama... How do you say that? The Camargue. South of France. Yeah. And then Italy a week before that. Siena. Which is all very nice, but what does it actually tell us? Well, it tells us that he was lying to his wife about being away in Spain on business. - What was he was doing there? - Horses! The Camargue is famous for its white horses. And Siena is famous for its Palio... One of the largest horse festivals in the world. [ Chamber music playing ] [ Indistinct conversations ] This'll loosen you up. AGATHA: Oh, Sarah. What are you doing here? Perry invited me. Have you seen him? Yes, I have. He's here somewhere. Wandering around looking puce. No idea why. Oh, I hope you don't mind, I've borrowed James. Oh, go ahead. Borrow away. He's very good. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Still don't quite know how we got roped into it in the first place. Oh, don't be silly. You're gonna smash it. Sarah, tell me, why was Perry at the vicarage the other day? I'm... I'm afraid I can't say. We... We spoke in the strictest confidence. Oh, come on! It might be relevant. I mean, is it to do with tonight? No, I-I'm sorry, Agatha. I can't. I can't. AGATHA: Right. [ Sighs ] Don't let Perry out of your sight. All night. We won't. [ Door closes ] BILL: Hey. Hi. What are you two doing here? We thought you'd appreciate a subtle police presence. Just in case. Please. No more shoves. Not tonight. AGATHA: I promise. Well, you seem a little more relaxed. Yes. Yes, it's Jerry, actually. He's been almost civil. Maybe my ploy worked after all. It's been rather nice. He, uh... He took me for lunch after the spa and made quite the fuss. It was just like the old days, when we bought this house together. We were madly in love. Right. Here's a question. Has Jerry always been into horses? Jerry? No. No, he suffers them. He can ride, though, can't he? - Ride what? - Horses. [ Laughing ] [ Continues laughing ] [ Laughing ] Jerry? Jerry? On a... On a horse? Not in a million. He's allergic to the things. [ Laughs ] Charles told me when he was talking to Felicity yesterday, Jeremy Laggat-Brown came out to the stables and said he was taking Comet for a ride. But given what his wife said, that don't make no sense. No. It really doesn't. [ Dog barking ] FELICITY: Hello! Hello! Hello! Oh, my God, it's Red! Wait, how does he know you? Oh, he was a stable pup, but we lost him. That's it. He's been trying to make his way home the entire time. Um, thank you all so much for coming back. Uh, we thought we'd do the speeches in here this time and, um, make the announcement ourselves to save our parents from having to do it. [ Laughter ] PERRY: So if you would all join me in a happy birthday toast to the most beautiful lady I've ever seen in my life, a woman that I can't wait to marry. To Cassandra. - To Cassandra! - To Cassandra! [ Applause ] Please welcome to the floor George and his partner, Agatha. [ Tango plays ] - AGATHA: We need to talk dates. - Mm! Not those kind of dates. I'm talking diary dates. You had to go and spoil the mood. Has Felicity just come back from being away? Yes. - Where's she been? - Uni friends in London. Do that often, does she? Now and then. And was she away last week? Yes. She was, in fact. I have to go. Sorry. GEORGE: But... no. What about our dance? Meet my stand-in. There's something's wrong with Tiggy. - I'm coming with you. - No. You stay here and keep an eye on Perry. Come on. [ Laughter ] [ Door opens ] Come on, darling. AGATHA: Excuse me! Where exactly are you taking her? She's just had a few too many, clearly. Just having a lie-down. No, no, no, no. She's not going anywhere. Tiggy, look at me. Have you taken pills? What has that got to do with anything? Just a couple of antidepressants. I've been feeling a bit down. Bill, check the bedroom. Call an ambulance. Don't you dare. I will decide what's right for Tiggy, thank you very much. I'm her husband. That's not all you are, though, is it? Come on out. I know you're here. Felicity. [ Cheers and applause ] Enjoying your sordid little affair, are you? The Camargue. Siena. Even though you hate horses. I've no idea what you're talking about. Oh? Really? BILL: Agatha? Pills. Identical to the ones we found on Harrison Peterson. AGATHA: Huh! I'm talking about you knowing Johnny Sullivan from Perry's dad. I think you tracked him down and hired him to kill your wife. Felicity here prompting the premature fireworks. - What? - You're so out of order. No, I'll tell you what's out of order. You having Perry's dad killed. I think he put two and two together after you tried to bump off your wife. And you didn't want anyone to find out, so you had to get rid of him, using his death to cover your own tracks. And then you sent Sullivan after Agatha. But fortunately for me, Sullivan had a bit of a sweet tooth, didn't he? All this for her, eh? Oh, Jerry. Me and Jerry? You've got it so wrong. Really? Have I? Because I spoke to your father, and you know what he told me? That you were away at exactly the same time as Jeremy was. And another thing... Unlike him, you love horses. [ Applause ] [ Tango plays ] - PERRY: Oh, sorry, sorry. - CASSANDRA: Okay. - PERRY: Ah! Sorry. - CASSANDRA: Oh! Oh. It's okay. [ Exhales sharply ] - I didn't mean to. Sorry. - Wait! I can't let you do this. It's killing you. I don't need you to tango to prove you love me. I know you do because you were prepared to. Wait. WOMAN: Just keep going! It's nothing! - [ Music stops ] - MAN: Solo! - [ Two-tone music plays ] - What's going on? Come on. You know. [ Cheers and applause ] Why would I be into Jeremy? Well, I'll tell you why. Because if Tiggy dies, Cassandra stands to inherit the fortune but not the house. And if you two are together, all of this will be yours again... The house, the stables, Comet. [ Gasps ] Imagine. Worth putting up with him for? This is ridiculous! It's nonsense! Hey! Oh, fancy that. A corrie dukit... A left-hander. Harrison's suicide note written by someone of the left-handed persuasion. What's going on? I still miss her, Dad. And it just feels like you've forgotten about me. The only thing I have left of her is this house and Comet. Which is why you hatched this little plan with Jeremy. The only way you could think of to get your home back. It's transactional, isn't it? - Am I right? - JEREMY: No. It's not about that. We love each other. Really? You poor deluded man. Who do you think you are? GEORGE: Felicity? I never wanted to leave. Mum died, Dad. And this was all we had. And you can have it again, my darling. Don't! I don't want you! I've never wanted you! How could I?! I've been your daughter's best friend since we were little. Do you see the lengths I have to go to just to get back here? I never wanted to go. I just... I want to be here. [ Crying ] This is my home. [ Police radio chatter ] GEORGE: I'm sorry. I never realized how much I was asking you to give up by moving. - You must have been so alone. - [ Crying ] I'm sorry. [ Rhythmic clapping ] PERRY: But what will your mum say? CASSANDRA: I don't care! [ Cheers and applause ] Care to share? Perry came to see me. He needed to confess his doubts about the deadly dance. But he needn't have worried. They're gonna be just fine. [ Cheering ] [ Cheering fades ] [ Down-tempo music plays ] All she wanted was to come home. ROY: Don't we all? Bit harsh. Especially as I've asked Gustav to turn the heating on. Praise the Lord. You can always come and stay at mine if you like. Oh, spoilt for choice all of a sudden. That's very kind, but I'm not really a vicarage kind of guy. [ Dog barks ] And as for you, well done on the dog. Thank you. Well done on the murders. Thank you. Team effort. God, we're good.
