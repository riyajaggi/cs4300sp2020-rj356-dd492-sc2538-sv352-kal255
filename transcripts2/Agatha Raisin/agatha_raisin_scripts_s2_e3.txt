Mary's that's the church that Tristan with curent at the time he was liked going there and we will duffer's get there before me yes Tristan was beaten up by louts in the youth group that he ran but that's haven't already told the police so you didn't tell the police everything anything that I know I think you should go wait did you know that Tristan was gay how did he no one has instincts oh why bisexual there was one man a rich businessman who showered him with gifts took him to fancy places but that all beaten up can you tell us the name of this rich businessman no no I don't know he leave us and I shouldn't have said as much they have I think the answer to Tristan's murder lies in Bristol if I have learned white car that it's the same car the night he was murdered oh please just been handing out free votes gel up for have fun please tell me you're investigating portress since madam oh excellent best news I've had all day wasn't what were you up to told you the answer in cars me [Music] dinner date with me that night as well his house and there he was cozying up with the vicar's wife she's married she's very happily married there was really nothing between them I knew that or at least Liz the happy jam maker knew that but Liz the infatuated spinster thought that every woman he met would if it makes you feel any better Saylor said the only reason that he was money that she didn't actually have well I realized he was only interested in my money did that make you angry have you ever been in love Sir Charles well you know inventing new jams that was all I needed to be happy until I met Tristan but as he said in his last sermon love is about that he was having an affair with a rich businessman no no he was flamboyant and grace Lansing might say that he was too gay because he wouldn't have sex with there was nothing homosexual about Tristan - Lyz cello reverend grace Lansing and mystery dodgy businessman all three of them in number systems along all three of them knew murder me good day's work how's my case going no idea I don't know of course you wouldn't relax not hear about that hear about Sara she's still a suspect [Music] richard pincer it had to be the Reverend grace all this door whoa it's done Tanabe sir let's see if we'll Grantham was having an affair with Grantham uh Richard in certain we don't have an appointment able to see him I'm Ellen partl his executive assistant him that Agatha reason is here to talk suspect we might not need an appointment [Music] celebrity card mr. pinzer doesn't know who you are or what you're talking about Charles Freight is here to see sometimes it helps to plan a local celebrity card Oh has no real money left do sit down mr. pinzer will be with you in a second blackmailing him I will be recording your entire conversation hmm new money not so impressed by all of money but it blackmail excuse Ellen's overprotective mr. chance trust ah see you went to Darwin - I wish now I'm a hilton grammar man but we played you a trucker ha good sure I must say I'm very impressed with what you've do you think we could maybe interrupt about what we came here to talk about so why are you a friend or sorry to be blunt a lover of the late Tristan Dillon a friend yes but a lover no can I ask how did you meet him he was raising money for a youth group he ran from his children's a child no none that he knows all Tristan felt like the son I never had me premises for his youth group took him to dinner a few times even bought him clothes but soon he wanted more and more I paid a visit to San Mary's Church and the vicar the youth crew met in the church hall called Tristan and asking for my money and wanted even more money not to tell my wife we were having an affair ex-wife and couldn't care less who I have an affair with or in this case I hope that helps oh I'm a sponsoring the duck race so I'm sure I'll see you both again at the costly hotel I believe him together I didn't play it Rucker I played squash squash mmm and play for ages rather miss a good hard game of squash just two opponents up against the wall smell of sweat well don't look at me our squash green days are over yeah that's a shame all I'm saying is that maybe it was his henchman beep Tristan up that time Vincent made his money in tech computer nerds don't have henchmen he's a red herring the truth is Tristan was using two-timing and blackmailing every woman who come under his spell which reminds me we need to track down that woman that Tristan was talking to after the service which woman he was talking to about 12 the glamour poof miss sex on legs where is a rebound to church and it's annoyingly younger than looking forward to questioning her where but for now we are going to an come to [Music] [Music] hi spending a lot of time together Bristol the other day what are you up to we're not up for anything apart from simply enjoying each other's company and getting out of the village puppet called the Cotswolds and for too long well I'll say no more freedom for Carly let's crush the oppressor thanks to that comrade inspector Percy I'm just here for a private word with word of Charlie same thing for Charlie welcome I have a new girlfriend called Alice we're very happy that is very sweet I'm usually more help with unhappy emotionally unavailable commitment fool I'm not a relationship advice thanks mom is very sweet and lovely did I know that yes I didn't know that but Alice is very shy and scared of meeting her so I was thinking before Alice meets my mom just to build up her confidence she well me what I might not more of a surrogate slightly older sister yes that's exactly what I thought good glad excuse me mom his mom I mean seriously books says Quora cars li Lord of the land that might be overdoing it a bit hmm I've had a thousand printed so after they've all gone up rethink Thanks that was the station there was a white Volkswagen belonging to Liz Jenna parked outside Tristan's on really really tristan also made a date with list yet up that night but he stood him I knew it we didn't know it or anything else care how you acquired any information but if you do know something please share it now bill well you know nothing about anything but if we find out dentist Tiffany to clean [Music] I know she said come alone but would you have a wife it's homemade nobody fine Oh never drink alone as my Maitlis gel stopped drinking and I didn't come on sit down not there died in that chair massive heart attack right in front of don't be I hated him I waited 10 minutes before I called the ambulance just to for me and one for you you said you had some secret information about Tristan Bella and I do my darling his real name was Terrence biles what do you make of that why would he change his name boy think bishop biles had a ring to it dinner were you in love with tristin Terence no fan said the pants off him but I knew it wouldn't lead anywhere I'm like Liz my poor deluded best friend women like me and Liz what you are necessary she went to a hold or two psychopath just a lonely lush I don't she could sober up long enough to kill so Tristan's real name with Terrence and biles he changed it which would be fair if my name was biles I think I'd change it to it's just that some of us are getting always thought you a rather beautiful [Music] how Co is this is very shy would you like a drink Alice what your tonic water please I just really think so Alice what do you do for a living the PA -
