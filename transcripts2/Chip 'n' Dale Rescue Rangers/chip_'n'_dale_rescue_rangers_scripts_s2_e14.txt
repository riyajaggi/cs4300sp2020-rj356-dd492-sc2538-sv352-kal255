[KNOCK KNOCK] I'M MYRON, FROM THE COLA CULT, REMEMBER? THERE'S SOMETHING I GOTTA TALK TO YOU ABOUT. HEY! WHOOPS! GEE... IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. YOUR CRAZY INVENTIONS COULD HURT SOMEBODY. HEY, WHERE'S MYRON? HE WAS HERE A SECOND AGO. WE'D BETTER GO FIND HIM. HE MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE. I STILL DON'T SEE WHY WE COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THE RANGERMOBILE. GOLLY! I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE RANGERMOBILE. COMPARED TO THIS, I DO. DON'T WORRY, THE GYROMOBILE IS MY BEST INVENTION YET. NOTHING COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG. [CRASH] I CAN FIX THAT. DON'T BOTHER. FROM HERE ON, I'M WALKIN'. WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE MYRON COULD BE? WELL, THERE'S NO SIGN OF THE LAD HERE. THIS PLACE IS EMPTIER THAN A PLATE FULL OF CHEESE. I KNEW THE GYROMOBILE WOULDN'T LET US DOWN. WHAT WAS THAT? OH, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. WHAT ABOUT THAT? THAT'S SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT. AAH! AAH! AAH! GOLLY! THIS INVENTION REALLY ISN'T WORKING VERY WELL AFTER ALL. MAYBE I AM LOSING MY TOUCH.

I'M QUITTING THE RESCUE RANGERS. NOW, GADGET, LOVE, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT TOO KEEN ON ME COOKING, BUT THAT'S NO REASON TO QUIT. GOLLY, MONTEREY... YOU'RE NOT THE REASON I'M QUITTING. I'M THE REASON. YOU SEE, IF I'M NOT INVENTING ANYMORE, I'M OF NO USE TO THE RANGERS. EVERYONE CAN CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING BUT ME. MONTEREY HAS HIS STRENGTH, ZIPPER HAS HIS SPEED. CHIP HAS HIS LEADERSHIP ABILITIES, AND DALE HAS.. HAS... A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. BUT I CAN'T EVEN LIVE UP TO MY NAME. SO I'M QUITTING. HOLD ON! YOU CAN'T QUIT. WHY NOT? WELL, BECAUSE, UH... MYRON!

BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT POP TOP'S REALLY UP TO. AND THEN WE HAVE TO FIND GADGET. I THINK WE JUST DID. THERE. ONCE WE FIZZ YOUR OLD TOOLS, YOU'LL BE RELIEVED OF THE BURDENS OF YOUR PAST LIFE. I CAN'T BELIEVE ME EYES! OUR GADGET'S LEFT US FOR THE COLA CULT! SEE? YOU WERE TOO HARD ON GADGET. ME?
