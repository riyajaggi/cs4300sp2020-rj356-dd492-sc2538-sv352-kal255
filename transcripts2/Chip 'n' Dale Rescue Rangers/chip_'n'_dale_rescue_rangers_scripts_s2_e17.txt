 ♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'n Dale ♪ Entering maze six ... I'll never know what's in the sixth maze. Hmm. Looks like a couple of loose wires. Some Rescue Rangers. Instead of helping the helpless, we're fixing video games. What if this Mr. Stanislavsky sees us takin' his things? Don't worry, Monty. This is the stuff he's thrown out. Try it now, Dale. You did it, Gadget! Hooray! Now maybe we can get something useful accomplished. If you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat it up the path to your door. That's what they say. And I, Ignat Stanislavsky, after many attempts, have built the best mousetrap there is. It's incredible! What is it? It looks like... a robot cat! Now, Tom, if you catch mice, I will give to you a fur coat just like a real cat. Now find a mouse and catch him! I think it's time we headed back home, mates. (hisses) Good work, Tom! Don't let him get away! Wh-wh-what sharp teeth ya got there, Ma. Thanks, ol' mate. Chew on this for a while, ya clockwork kitty. We gotta put that switch off! Uh-oh... missed! Tom! Come back here! Dale! Where are you? Help! Dale! Give us a hand! Congratulations, you have completed maze seven. Hooray! Uh-oh! Shoo! Go! Get out, you little pests! Oh, another failure. What good is a cat that can't catch mice? Yah! Keep it away from me! Relax! It's turned off. That's no way to treat an invention. Poor little thing. Have you gone bonzo loco? That thing just tried to eat us! I bet with a few adjustments he could be a very nice cat. No such animal. I could reprogram him. With what? Oh, say... Dale's video game. Hey, yeah! It's called "Dogs and Cats". And the cat in this game is a hero. Eh, sort of. Listen, Gadget. That thing's a killer. You can't change that. I know you can do it, Gadget. I believe in ya, even if he doesn't. (raspberry) Help me get him back to Ranger headquarters. I know I'm gonna regret this. Boss! This ain't gonna work! The place is too well guarded! We tried to nab her at the docks when she came off the boat. And we tried to grab her off the transport truck. Nevertheless, you failed. Which is why I'm personally devoting my valuable time and attention to make sure you don't fail again. I have a date with the rarest and most expensive tropical fish in the world! Now, Freddy, the subject is closed. But, Dad... We have fish. Fish are decorative. You can't cuddle a fish. We have Butch. You can't cuddle him, either. Cats eat fish. You want my lovely and very expensive fish to be eaten? If I had a cat, I'd train him not to. Well, you couldn't train him not to shed. All my expensive furniture would be ruined. Besides, you know how allergic I am. As soon as I get near a cat, my doze stuffs up, and by eyes get watery, and-- ah-choo! And I start steezing-- Butch? There's a cat in here! Get him! Oh, Mepps? (barking) (Butch growling) Oh, poor little Luna. Did the big bad kitty scare you? Now do you see why you can't have a cat? Yes, sir. Okay, Dale, give me the cartridge. Okay, here goes nothin'. (electronic voice) Hi! Let's be friends. Eh, what are your feelings about mice? I don't know. What are they? You're lookin' at one, mate. Well, I like you, so I guess I like mice. -Hooray! -Hooray! Phooey! The instant one of his circuits gets scrambled, he'll be after us again. No, I won't. Honest! I just wanna be friends. All I want is somebody to take me in, and pet me, and love me like a real cat. We can find him a home. Who's gonna pet a tin can? He's right. I won't be a real cat until I have some fur. Come on, Tom! We're Rescue Rangers! We'll find ya some fur! This is ridiculous. Tom needs our help. Please, Chip! Well, I suppose somebody has to keep an eye on him. Dale: We'll check all the trash cans. Something will turn up that'll make you a nice fur coat. Boy, you guys are the best friends a cat could ever have. Eh? A fine bunch of henchmen you are. Can't even steal a stupid fish! What I need is a fearless cat, a dog-proof cat, a mechanical cat! A mechanical cat? Hi, there! Hello, my galvanized feline friend. That sure is a nice coat. Oh, you like it? It's tailor-made. I had-- oh. You mean this coat. Wish I had one like it. Hmm. Whoever made you didn't give you fur, eh? Come with me... and I'll see to it you get properly... fleeced. -Hey, boss! -Slow down! Wait for us! In order to give you your very own coat of fur, I'm going to have to shut you down for a moment. You don't mind, do you? Now, to find out what makes this clockwork cat tick! A video game cartridge! Of course! With a different cartridge, he could be very useful to me. Mepps! Wart! All of you! Go to the nearest toy store and get me another game cartridge. A really violent one. Oh, goodie! I like video games. And no playing in the store! Now, to turn this simpering little tin toy into a weapon of total destruction. We won't need this off switch anymore. (sinister mechanical voice) Hello... (growling) What are your orders, commander? This is the enemy. (growling) Ooh... effective. Now, for your mission. Not a sign of him anywhere. We've got to find him. We've got to keep looking. He may be in trouble. Or making trouble, more likely. Hmm. I'm not expecting visitors. I have come for the fish. Stand aside or prepare to be destroyed. A robot cat. I don't believe it. I have come for the fish. Get out of my way, or I will attack. Sic him, Butch! I had a feelin' he was gonna say that. Give me the fish. You'll have to get past me first, pal. Hey, don't look to me for help. Get him! Enemy forces engaged. Entering destruction mode. Attack. Attack. You are my prisoner. You will come with me. (gasp) He's got Luna! Don't just stand there, get him! I'm workin' awful hard for a guy who gets paid in dog food. Did you see him? Any clues? Nothing. This is all a complete waste of time! Climb aboard, guys! We thought we'd get the Ranger plane to help us in our search. Listen, Gadget. This is ridiculous. We'll never find him. I'm not so sure we should even try. But, Chip, we rescued him from the junk pile. We're responsible for him. She's right, we can't just abandon the little bloke now. But he's just a machine. (sigh) All right, keep looking. What a night! Robot cats, fishnappers, and me, beaten in a fight! Nothin' would surprise me at this point. Huh, a squirrel-powered zeppelin. A squirrel-powered zeppelin! (barking) What's he barkin' about? Maybe he saw Tom! Let's question him! Hey, pal! We're lookin' for a friend of ours. Maybe you've seen him. Yeah, he's a robot. Are you in with him? If you are, so help me I'll pound ya. Take it easy! We don't know what you're talkin' about. I'm talkin' about that metal cat that just trashed my master's house! Did you say "metal cat"? That's right, and he took my master's new pet fish. Ya see? I told you! I knew you couldn't change his instincts! I don't believe it! He coudn'ta done it! Well, he did! And he was the second one to try it this evenin'! Somebody else tried to take the fish? Who? Who? I never saw him before, some big cat in a business suit. Crikey! Sounds like Fat Cat! How much you wanna bet Fat Cat got his hands on Tom? We gotta find him! We gotta save him! Listen! We may know where your master's fish is! No way I'm tanglin' with that mechanized maniac again! Then get your master! Bring him to the cat food cannery at the edge of town. We'll meet ya there! Rescue Rangers away! At last, Luna, the world's rarest tropical fish! Such beauty, such delicacy, such priceless rarity. Truly, this unique pinnacle of Mother Nature's handiwork will make a superb addition to my renowned collection of fine dinners! The marinade's almost done, boss. But this recipe says she's gotta soak in it for half an hour. Put her in! (coughing) Nothing must disturb my enjoyment of this meal. Go outside and stand watch. Let no one enter! I obey! Unidentified craft approaching. It's him! Hey, Tom! It's us! Are you okay? Attack. I told you he couldn't be trusted. Something's wrong. I've gotta find out what's wrong with him. How? Take us down. What are you doing? I'm gonna switch him off. I'm going with you! Yah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hooo! Over here, ya big bag of bolts! (raspberry) Enemy soldiers. Destroy. Don't worry, Dale. I'll have him turned off in a second. The switch! It's gone! Now ya tell me! Enemy soldiers. Destroy. I can't shut him off! Enemy soldiers. Destroy. Leave him alone, Tom! You big bully! What's the matter with you? Why are you trying to hurt us? You are the enemy. You must be destroyed. Yikes! Yahoo! Just like huntin' shark off the Sydney coast! Uh-oh! Help me untie it! That's it! Someone replaced Dale's cartridge with this war game! And I'd wager that someone is Fat Cat himself! He's got Luna, and we have to get her back! And help Tom! He's been an awful lot of trouble, Gadget. Maybe we should just leave him the way he is. I know he has good in him, Chip. You can't blame him for what Fat Cat did. All right, but we help the fish first. Oh, my prize fish stolen, my house wrecked-- what more can happen to me? (barking) You stupid dog, have you gone nuts? Stop that! Wait, Dad. I think Butch is trying to tell us something. (barking) Maybe he's found Luna! Well, don't just stand there. Lead the way! I don't get it. It says separate two eggs, but it doesn't say how far apart to separate 'em. Let me see that, you pinheads! Take one cup flour, two cups milk, one pinch salt. Don't tell me you pinched the salt! Of course not! Mepps pinched it. Quick! While they're not looking. Stop them! We gotta find where that drain lets out! Uh, what about them? We'll give them their just desserts! Jump, Monterey! Move it! My million-dollar dinner gone down the drain! Are you gonna eat that cherry? Look! I found my old game! Once we fix Tom, he can help us find the fish! He's done enough already! Come on! I don't care what you say. Tom deserves a second chance! What happened? It's a long story. Come on! We gotta save a fish! Rescue Rangers, away! Wait for us! Hey, mate! Follow us! She'll have to come out down there in the sewers! (barking) Oh, take a hint, will ya? Hmm, maybe Luna's down in the sewer. And he's supposed to be the dominant species on the planet. Where do you think she'll come out? Could be anywhere. After her, lads! Well, I don't know if I can fit through that. I can, Dad. Son, no! It's okay, Dad! Dale: To the rescue! It's that killer cat! You keep away from my son! That boy shouldn't be down here. It's dangerous! Luna! Oh, no! Hold it up, Tom. Hang on, kid! Climb down, kid. That cat's attacking him! No, he's not, he's savin' him! You're right! Who said that? (whistling) No! It's now or never! What are you doing? Lower, Gadget! Gotcha! Freddy! Freddy, are you okay? I'm fine, Dad. That's the cat that trashed our house! But he saved me. I don't get it. Maybe it's a different cat. And, look, he saved Luna. (sigh) Meow. You're alive! Yeah! And I've got my own fur! Just like a real cat! But where did you get it? (laughs) Well, at least I'm not allergic to this cat. I'd trade all my expensive things for a pet like this one. I gotta hand it to you, Gadget. You were right about Tom after all. I always believed in you. Every cat should have a home. Now if we could only find a good home for Fat Cat. Yeah, like the state pen!
