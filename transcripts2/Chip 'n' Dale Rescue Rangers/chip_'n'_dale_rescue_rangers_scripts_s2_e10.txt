 -Say good-bye, honey. -Man on P.A.: The zoo will be open again at 9:00 tomorrow morning. Thank you for visiting and please come again. I got it! -Thanks, Elliott. -No problem, Chip. Now me! Now me! I want to do a loopity loop! (laughs) One loop de loop coming right up! -Ready, Chipper? -All set. (laughs) -Heads up! -I got it! I got it! I got it! (Chip laughing) Hey! Are we supposed to do all the work ourselves? This is Elliott's pile, you know. A little to the right, Zipper! Right there! Careful there, Zipper. Captain Colonel's mighty persnickety about his peanut formations. Thanks for your help, guys. I want this just right for my pop. The Rescue Rangers are always glad to lend a hand. Yeah, especially since we get to munch all the peanuts we want. Hey! Get your own peanut! Golly! Good afternoon, Captain Colonel. (clears throat) Rodents in the food supply! This won't do at all! Sorry, Pop. Uh, sir. My pile got away from me. No wonder. They'll gobble your provisions the moment you blink! -We would not! -You just can't trust them! -You can, too! -We're the Rescue Rangers! That's right, Pop! And they're my friends! Elliott, you are my son, but beyond that, you're a pachyderm, and pachyderms and rodents do not mix. I'll pack that trunk of his nine ways to Pittsburgh! -Now, Monty. -Sorry, lad. -It's just that-- -That's okay. Pop has a lot of responsibilities as leader of the herd. He gets kind of stuffy at times. Don't worry, Elliott. We'll have this cleaned up in no time. Right. Come on, Dale. I think some nuts rolled into the next cage. Dale: Hey, lookit! There's another one! Gosh. I wonder how it got way over here. You clumsy-- you dropped all the nuts! Me? You're the one that threw the peanut at me! -It's still your fault. -Is not! -Is too! -Both: Oh! What do you think you're doing? That's my last peanut! Whoops! Sorry about that. We thought it was from the elephants' pile. The elephants have a pile of peanuts? -Hey! -Oh! Hey, ape faces! I got a lead on the peanut thieves! Yo, Captain! Who died and made you Mr. Peanut? Mmm. Watch your tone, Bruin! Check it out, Jeebee! Looks like we found the goober grabbers! Can't get enough of your own, eh? Had to snorkel up ours too, huh? Let us spell it out, nose-bud. The rest of us had all our peanuts nabbed. And now your guys with them built-in Hoovers are swimming in 'em! You're calling us thieves? Well, the peanuts ain't disappearing by themselves! Hear that? Sounds like a case for us! Don't blame the results of your incompetence on us simply because we have a superior method of food storage! Yeah, well, somebody's been taking our food. Then look to those sinister-looking simians behind you. -Hey! Not us! -We was robbed, too! -Captain, we can help. -We've caught plenty of crooks. Oh, golly! Captain: Look sharp, men. There are peanut thieves about! I want round the clock surveillance! What? Pop! I know someone great at crime-solving! We could use the Rescue Rangers! We are pachyderms, son. We take care of our own affairs! Bruin: Not so fast, hose nose. Just what is a Rescue Ranger? They solve mysteries and help people and catch crooks just like the ones who stole your peanuts. Huh. Sounds like the sort of heavy-duty help we could use. So, where do we find these super men? Right here. (laughter) I got it! I got it! You yell real loud at their ankles, right? They'll go undercover as peanuts! Yeah, and they'll a-roast the crooks. -(laughing) -A-roasting peanut. Oh, good one, what? Well, that blows it. All right, which pop-off's first? I'll yank you pesky-derms through the eye of a needle! No, Monterey, don't hurt them-- -for Elliott's sake. -(grumbles) Well, all right, but only for Elliott's sake. (laughter continues) All right, get a hold of yourselves! I suggest we give these Ranger persons a chance. Don't go doing us no favors! -Shh! -They are allegedly experienced in methods of detection, and their diminutive size may actually give them an edge of sorts. You won't be sorry, Captain. We'll start by questioning every possible witness. Rescue Rangers away! (chuckles) Give me a break. Well, if you see anything suspicious, let us know, will ya? Guess no one's home. So, you're sure you didn't see anything? Not a thing, and we were hanging around all night. Come on, you blaming dinosaur! I got some questions! (roars) (yells, groans) Uh, right, we'll catch you later. Chip: Hello? Anybody home? -Hi ,there! We-- -We don't know anything about the missing nuts. Ting-a-Ling. We are honored by your presence. -Likewise. -Wait a minute! How'd you know we were looking for the peanuts? It would be hard not to know that's why you are here. Wow! May I? Golly! This has better optics than the one we have at Ranger headquarters! Ooh! Are you an engineering student, too? I just sort of dabble. Self-taught, mostly. Ming-Ting: How nice to find a kindred spirit. Mother thought we were too wrapped up in our inventions. So she sent us on this stupid zoo tour for some culture. Ting-a-Ling. Not that we do not like your country. (sighs) We just did not expect to miss our home so much. Homesick, huh? Chip: Hey, what's this thing? Oh, please to be careful. It is very delicate. -Sure looks neat. -It is our digging machine. Uh, he means for our garden... for the cultivation of bamboo. Gee, I'd love to see more of your stuff. -I'll be back later, okay? -Yes, we'll talk then. So, your interrogations came up with nothing. (humphs) That's about what I expected from you rodents. (trumpets) Attention! Circle up for peanut detail! (rumbling) (coughing) Not that we don't have complete faith in you, but this way it's no one in, no one out. Thanks, Captain. All right, Rangers. -Dale and I will take the first watch. -Yes, sir! (elephants snoring) -(yawns) -(snoring continues) -Hey, wake up! -Wha-- huh? -Chip: You were sleeping. -Dale: Was not. I was resting my eyes. Chip: Not so, I say. You were asleep! You're supposed to watch the nuts, not me, you big dummy. "Big dummy" me? You're the one who was asleep! -(both shouting) -(rumbling) -We're supposed to watch the nuts! -I know! The nuts! -(both shout) The nuts! -(clears throat) -Our nuts! -Wah! Where's the fire? -Wait a minute. Where are the nuts? -Both: Uh-oh. Caught you red-handed! I knew rodents couldn't be trusted! Huh? What are you talking about? We're trying to save the peanuts! Save them for yourself, you mean. (sniffs) Aha! Just as I suspected! Peanut breath! -(elephant gasps) -(murmuring) -I only had one. -Hey, you hose-heads! -Cut the racket! -Yeah, shove a stopper in them trumpets of yours. Hold on there, Heebee. Looks like our pachydermal pals had a visit from the peanut pinchers. Ooh! I think you're right, Jeebee. Did those Ranger guys catch the crooks? Captain: Hardly. The Rescue guys are the crooks! -What? -You're kidding. I knew you couldn't trust 'em! Where'd they stash the goods? Yeah! I mean, they couldn't have eaten them all! I don't know. This one looks like he put away a few. Keep your hairy meathooks off of me! We didn't steal a darn thing! -We're just trying to help! -There is no proof that they did it. Yes, there couldn't be, because we-- -Shh! -Catch those crooks. Smash 'em into peanut butter! -(trumpets) -Things are getting ugly. They'll look a lot uglier when I get through with 'em. -Yeah! -I say skin 'em. Dale: Look out! -Don't let 'em get away! -Over there! -Get 'em! -(shouting) Come on, get those guys! Come on, where are they hiding? (whistles sharply) -(shouts) -Huh? -We can't keep this up! -We've got to get over the wall before we're caught! Good luck! (inhales deeply) (screaming) Elliott, how could you? Papa, please. They're my friends. I'm sorry, son, but those scoundrels were just using you to get to our peanuts. No, Papa! They'd never do that! I-- I don't think. Listen to that! They've got Elliott believing we're the thieves. But we didn't do anything! Those skruggers already got us tried and convicted. (crying) Nobody will trust the Rescue Rangers again. What? Hey! What'd you do that for? We know we didn't steal the peanuts! -Right! -Do we know who did? -No. -Then what are we waiting for? Rescue Rangers away! Keep alert, men! We must protect the last of the peanuts until we can restock! Open your eyes, son. We must be on the lookout for those rodent fiends. Yes, Father. We've gotta look for clues where the peanuts disappeared. No problem! Leave the distraction to Gadget and me. Be careful, guys. Here's one for you, Captain! A 21-nut salute! Sneak attack! (trumpeting) Take cover, troops! -Hurry and look for clues! -(coconut whistling) (Zipper shouts) (both scream) This is how they did it. They took the peanuts through these tunnels. What is this stuff? -It's peanut butter. -(Zipper babbles) This is weird. What kind of thing could've dug this tunnel? -Thing? -I don't recognize the claw marks. But whatever it was, it sure was big. Ju-ju-ju-just how big? -(squeaking) -(all gasp) -A monster! -Run! -Oh no! -It's a dead end! -It ate the panda kids! -You dummy! It's a machine! -What's going on here? -(both sigh) Monty! We're out of coconuts! Well, I wouldn't worry about that, Gadget! -Get down! -Ready troops? Return fire! (inhaling deeply) I'm glad we weren't shooting watermelons! You see, the engine of our dragon digger runs on peanut oil that we get from smashing peanuts. And that's what makes the peanut butter! Mm-hmm-hmm! Yum! We finally have enough fuel to let us dig all the way to China. Wowee! Look at all them peanuts! Ming-Ting: We know stealing the peanuts was wrong. We just didn't know we would miss our parents so much. Don't worry. The Rescue Rangers will find a way to get you home. Head for the peanut pile! Rodent attack! Quick, men! Double stomp! (both scream) The fiendish devils! They're trying subterranean subterfuge! Well, we'll flush them out! Attention men! Triple stomp! No, Papa! You'll crush them! (whirring, spitting) Wait! You do not know how to drive it! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-ho! We've got them on the run now, men! Papa, stop! (gasps) It was you guys. Crikey, Gadget! Look at the peanuts! Bet them pachyderms would quit their rumba if they got these back. We wish to make amends. We can help return them. But it took us a long time to get them all down here. -Monterey, we need the firehouse! -Right! (crocodile roars) Bombs away, Gadget! -Phew! I sure am glad we got that thing stopped. -(rumbling) Wha-- what's that? (gibbering) Strange. Doesn't sound like a rodent. (screams) (gasps) It's all the peanuts. But who could've... Rescue Rangers at your service, Captain. Man on P.A.:  We feel the pandas will get better care back home in China. They sure seem pleased for being so sick. Man 2: Do you think this panda pox may be contagious? Well, not unless you consider paint contagious. -Hey! -(laughter) Capital job, Rangers. Um, perhaps you could help me with something else? -Sure! -What can we do for you? I believe it's called a loop de loop? (laughs) I always knew they'd solve the case. -Hey, they're the Rescue Rangers! -(laughter)
