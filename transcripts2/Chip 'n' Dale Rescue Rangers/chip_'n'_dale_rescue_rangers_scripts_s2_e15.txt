 ♪ WHEN THERE'S DANGER ♪ ♪ CH-CH-CH-CHIP 'N' DALE ♪ [GASP] WE'VE DONE IT! WE'VE FOUND THE TOMB OF KING NOTUNCOMMON. TREASURE? OH, BOY. HEY! THIS IS A RING, JUST MY KIND OF SOUVENIR-- EASY TO CARRY AND REAL VALUABLE. WEXLER, PUT THAT BACK RIGHT NOW! OW! EVERY ITEM HERE HAS TO BE LOOKED AT, LABELED, LOGGED, AND LISTED BEFORE IT CAN BE MOVED. YE GADS! WHAT? THIS RING IS THE KEY TO THE SPHINX OF INKADINKADOO. IT IS? HMM... ACCORDING TO MY TRANSLATION, IF YOU PLACE THIS RING ON-- NO, IN THE FOREHEAD OF THE REAL SPHINX, YOU RELEASE THE KING'S DIAMONDS. DIAMONDS? I'LL GO BUY THE TRAIN TICKETS. AAH! NOT YET. WE'LL GO TO INKADINKADOO JUST AS SOON AS WE FINISH UP CATALOGUING EVERYTHING HERE. THAT OUGHT TO TAKE 10 OR 12 YEARS, IF YOU WRITE FAST. YEARS? CROCKERY'S CRACKED! I'M NOT WAITING YEARS TO GET THE SPHINX'S DIAMONDS. ONCE I GET MY HANDS ON THOSE JEWELS, I'LL NEVER LOOK AT, LABEL, LOG, OR LIST ANYTHING EVER AGAIN. OH, EXCUSE ME. AAH! GRRR! PLEASE DON'T HURT ME. GRRR! [SOBBING] HEY, IS THAT AS FAST AS YOU CAN MOVE? GRRR! HA! YOU RAG PILE, YOU COULDN'T CATCH A COLD. NEXT STOP, SPHINXVILLE. BOO HOO HOO! IN JUST 10 MINUTES, I'LL BE ON THE TRAIN FOR INKADINKADOO AND HOT AND COLD RUNNING DIAMONDS! BYE, SANDY! GLAD WE COULD HELP SWAT YOUR INSECT PROBLEM. TOO RIGHT! AND IF THOSE BEDOUIN BEETLE BUGS EVER ATTACK YOUR CARAVAN AGAIN, JUST CALL ON THE RESCUE RANGERS. BAG COMING DOWN. HEY, WATCH IT, MONTEREY! THIS IS VALUABLE STUFF. WHO YOU KIDDIN'? IT'S JUNK. REALLY, DALE, YOU HAVE MORE SOUVENIRS THAN WE HAVE SPACE. DALE? NOT ANOTHER SOUVENIR! DALE! WHOA! WHOA! OOH! HEY! THIS WOULD MAKE A SWELL NUT JAR. LOOKS LIKE ME LITTLE PALLY'S GONE TO POT. SEE WHAT YOUR COLLECTING'S GOT YOU INTO, DALE? OH, LOOK OUT! OH, NO! DR. CROCKERY! I HAVE TO HIDE THE RING. WEXLER, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? I... I... I... LUNCH BREAK WAS OVER 20 MINUTES AGO. LUNCH BREAK? OH, LUNCH BREAK! WELL, SIR... I WAS THINKING THAT WE NEEDED MORE, EH-- WATER JARS. WATER JARS? CAPITAL IDEA, MAN. WE COULD PROBABLY FIND REAL USE FOR THAT IN THE DESERT. THIS ONE LOOKS GOOD, SIR. OOPS. SORRY. NEVER CAN BE TOO CAREFUL IN A DESERT, SIR. BETTER GET EXTRA. OOPS, AGAIN. WEXLER! BUT THE RING SHOULD BE-- SORRY, SIR. [CRASH] WEXLER! BOY, THESE ARE SLIPPERY. LOOK AT WHAT I GOT. YOU AND YOUR GOOFY SOUVENIRS. THIS ISN'T GOOFY. THIS IS VALUABLE. ENOUGH TO GET US ALL INTO TROUBLE? WHAT TROUBLE? SAVING-YOUR-NECK TROUBLE. I'VE HEARD OF RING AROUND THE ROSEY, BUT NOT AROUND THE DALE. OH, GREAT! NOW YOU'RE STUCK AND WE GOT A TRAIN TO CATCH. I'VE GOT AN IDEA. FOLLOW ME! I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS, GADGET. OH, IT'S REALLY A SIMPLE MECHANISM. THE TORQUE RATIO SHOULD CREATE THE MOMENTUM NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE RING. WHENEVER SHE SAYS "SHOULD", CROSS YOUR FINGERS. GEE, UHHH... I DON'T KNOW. I WAS GETTIN' SORTA ATTACHED TO IT. OKAY, GUYS! LET IT GO! WHOA-HO! CUT THE ROPE! CUT THE ROPE! HMM. THE NEXT TIME WE'LL REVERSE THE ANGLE... OR NOT. GOLLY! WHAT'S THAT? GRRR! CRIKEY! ONE OF THE WALKING UNWRAPPED! A MUMMY! WHAT'S HE AFTER? I DON'T LIKE THE WAY HE'S LOOKIN' AT ME. HE'S COMING THIS WAY! RUN! HEY! WHAT ABOUT ME? LET ME GO! LET ME GO! HEY! PUT HIM DOWN! DROP HIM, YA MOLDY OLDIE, OR I'LL KNOCK YOU BACK TO ZOMBIE LAND. OUCH! OH, PLEASE DON'T RUN. I NEED THE RING. GOLLY! HE SOUNDS LIKE HE JUST WANTED THE RING. YEAH! HE DIDN'T WANT TO HURT US. I THINK IT WAS MONTY WHO HURT HIM. HURT HIM? HE'S DEAD, ISN'T HE? I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THEIR RULES, RIGHT? EXCUSE US, MR. MUMMY. OH! CALL ME HIRAM. ARE YOU IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE? WE'RE THE RESCUE RANGERS. I JUST NEED THAT RING BACK, OR I WON'T BE ABLE TO REST. REST? BACK AT THE TOMB. YOU SEE, I'M THE GUARDIAN OF THE RING, SORT OF A NIGHT WATCHMAN FOR KING NOTUNCOMMON'S TOMB. SO, THIS RING BELONGS BACK AT THE TOMB, NOT IN A SOUVENIR COLLECTION. MY JOB DEPENDS ON IT, NOT THAT IT'S MUCH, BUT I GET FREE ROOM AND BOARD. OF COURSE, THEY HAD TO BURY ME ALIVE. I'M SURE I COULD GET THE RING OFF DALE IF I HAD A LITTLE TIME. WELL, AT LEAST WE CAN GET HIM BACK TO THE TOMB. DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS WILL LOOSEN THE RING, GADGET? YEAH, LOVE. ME OX FAT AND HOT COALS DIDN'T SEEM TO WORK. BUT YOU WEREN'T BEING SCIENTIFIC. WHEN THE SPEAR HITS THE GONG, THE VIBRATION SHOULD POP THAT RING RIGHT OFF. SHE SAID "SHOULD" AGAIN, MATES. WATCH OUT. "CATALOGUE THIS. WASH THE ARTIFACTS. GET THE CAMERA READY." PHOOEY! GO AHEAD, HIRAM! [GULP] BE GENTLE, HIRAM. AND I WAS SO CLOSE TO-- AHH! THE RING! HE'S THE ONE WHO STOLE THE RING IN THE FIRST PLACE! GET HIM! I'M NOT GONNA LOSE THIS AGAIN. EAT DARK, RAG FACE. HA HA HA HA! I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT ONTO A CHIPMUNK, BUT I SURE KNOW AN EASY WAY OF GETTING IT OFF. [GULP] WEXLER! YES, PROFESSOR? JUST WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS? AHH, EH-- FIXING A SNACK. THAT'S NO WAY TO TREAT A PRICELESS CEREMONIAL DAGGER. ALL THESE ARTIFACTS MUST BE WASHED AND READY TO PHOTOGRAPH TOMORROW. YOU CAN EAT LATER. PEEKABOO. I SEE YOU. COME ON! WE GOTTA GET DALE. WHAT? WHOA-HO! HUH? WHERE'D THAT RING GO? THE RING! [KISS] THE KEY TO THE PHARAOH'S DIAMOND! [KISS KISS KISS] [LAUGHS] IF I HURRY, I CAN STILL MAKE THE MIDNIGHT TRAIN TO INKADINKADOO. WHERE'S HE GOING? HE SAID THE RING WAS THE KEY TO THE PHARAOH'S DIAMONDS. OH, MY! HE'S GOT HIS TRANSLATION WRONG. THE RING'S NOT THE KEY TO THE PHARAOH'S DIAMONDS. IT'S THE KEY TO A DEMON. THE PHAROAH'S DEMON! DEMON, DIAMOND... WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? THE SPHINX IS THE PHARAOH'S WATCHDOG. IF HE AWAKENS IT WITH NO PHARAOH TO CONTROL IT, WE'LL ALL BE DOOMED. LOOKAT! THERE'S THE TRAIN TRACKS. GOLLY! MONTEREY JACK'S SHORT CUT REALLY WORKED. TOO RIGHT. THERE'S THE TRAIN. ALL RIGHT, SANDY, LET'S DO IT! RESCUE RANGERS, AWAY! OH, DEAR! I DON'T KNOW. STEADY, HIRAM. STEADY... NOW! SEE YOU AT THE SPHINX, SANDY. [NHAAA] LET'S GET IN AND GET THAT RING! NOT SO FAST, DALE. WE CAN'T JUST WALK IN THERE WITH A MUMMY. WE GOTTA DISGUISE HIM. LET'S CHECK THIS ONE. [CLUCK CLUCK] TRY THE NEXT ONE. IT'S WEXLER! HE'S IN THERE! [SNORE] HA HA HA! PLEASE, JOIN ME FOR SUPPERTIME. UM... OHH... UH, WELL-- GET HIM OUT. WE'LL GET THE RING. TOO RIGHT! BESIDES, THE BLOKE HASN'T HAD A BITE TO EAT FOR OVER 2,000 YEARS. OKAY, NOW IT'S UP TO US. [SNORE] [COUGH COUGH] [HUMMING A LULLABY] HMMM. [KNOCK ON DOOR] WHAT? HUH? COME WITH ME TO THE CASBAH. I AM BEGGING OF YOU! WHEN I TOLD HIM I WAS A MUMMY. HE SAID HE LOVED CHILDREN! THE MUMMY! GIVE ME THE RING! UH! ZIPPER, PULL THE EMERGENCY CORD! [BRAKES SCREECH] THE RING! MY JOB IS SAVED! A GUY LIKE ME DOESN'T HAVE MANY EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. NOT SO FAST, BANDAGE BRAIN! SO LONG, SUCKERS! I'M OFF TO CLAIM MY DIAMONDS! IT'S THE DEMON THAT'S GOING TO BE CLAIMING HIM! LEGENDS TELL US THAT THE GREAT PHARAOH NOTUNCOMMON USED THE SPHINX TO GUARD HIS TREASURE. NOW, IF YOU'LL STEP OVER HERE, WE HAVE A MARVELOUS PHOTO OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU ALL. I HAVE TO GET THE RING UP TO ITS FOREHEAD. I'LL NEED SOME ROPE. PSST, DALE, CAN YOU SEE WEXLER? NAH, BUT DON'T WORRY. I'LL KEEP LOOKING. HEY! WHAT DOIN' THAT FOR? YOU AND YOUR SOUVENIRS! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT! I WAS! WAS NOT! WAS TOO! NOT! TOO! NOT! TOO! [CHATTERING] ENOUGH OF THAT, ME LITTLE PALLIES. WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A CROOK TO CATCH. RIGHT! AND WE'D BETTER HURRY! OOH! WHOA-HO! LET'S GO! OOH HOO HOO! STOP THAT! I'M TICKLISH! OOH! AH! KEEP THE RING AWAY FROM ITS... UH-OH! UH-OH! FOREHEAD. RRAWR! AAH! AAH! [THUD] AAH! WHOA! RRAWR! WHO DARES SUMMON THE PHARAOH'S DEMON? D-D-D-DEMON? IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE D-D-D-DIAMONDS! RRAWR! RARWR! UGH! [WHISTLE] OVER HERE, MATE! I SUMMONED YOU, THE PHARAOH OF INKADINKADOO! WHOA-HO! DIAMONDS! AWFULLY SMALL FOR A PHARAOH, AREN'T YOU? Y-YEAH. I'VE BEEN SICK. I'M RICH! I'M RICH! I'M RICH! HEY, WHAT'S THIS RUBY DOING IN HERE? [STOMP STOMP STOMP] [RARWR] HELP! WE'LL RAM HIM! THAT'LL STOP HIM. STEP ON IT, HIRAM! STEP ON WHAT? PUT YOUR FOOT TO THE PEDAL! THE OTHER PEDAL! AAH! AAH! GRR! AAH! ARE YOU SURE THIS'LL WORK, GADGET? SURE! NOT REALLY, BUT IT SHOULD. WHY DO I ASK? CAN'T YOU GO FASTER? CAN'T YOU GO FORWARD? UGH! UH! ARGH! RRAWR! RRAWR! THAT WON'T HOLD HIM LONG. WE HAVE TO GET THE RING BACK! QUICK, HIRAM! CAN YOU GIVE US A HAND? ALL ABOARD! RESCUE RANGERS, AWAY! KEEP HIM BUSY WHILE I GET THE RING. WHAT? OH, WELL. AAH! COOTCHY COOTCHY COO! [AH... AH... AH...] HURRY, CHIP! HE'S GONNA BLOW! [AH... AH-CHOO] YOU DID IT! YOU STOPPED THE SPHINX AND GOT THE RING! NOW I CAN REST AGAIN. I'M JUST GLAD WE COULD HELP, HIRAM, BUT IT WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT SOUVENIR. HA HA! AT LEAST I'LL HAVE THIS DIAMOND! [CRASH] WEXLER! YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROFESSION! TAKE HIM AWAY, OFFICERS. I'M TOUGH. I CAN DO A LITTLE HARD TIME. I'VE ALSO ARRANGED FOR YOU TO CONTINUE CATALOGUING THE ARTIFACTS RIGHT IN YOUR JAIL CELL. NO, NO! ANYTHING BUT THAT! HELP! THANKS EVER SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. YOU'RE THE BEST FRIENDS A MUMMY COULD EVER HAVE. PROBABLY THE ONLY ONES, I'D SAY. HEY, WHERE'S ME BUCKO DALE? IF HE'S HUNTING MORE SOUVENIRS... UGH! UH! AAH!
