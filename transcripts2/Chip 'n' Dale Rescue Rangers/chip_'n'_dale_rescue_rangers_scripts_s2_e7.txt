 ♪ WHEN THERE'S DANGER ♪ ♪ CH-CH-CH-CHIP 'N DALE ♪ DON'T SLOW DOWN NOW. WE DON'T WANT GADGET TO BE SHORT OF AIR. [WHEEZING] WHAT ABOUT ME? I'M ALREADY SHORT OF BREATH. CHIP'S RIGHT, MATE. NOW COME ON, DOUBLE TIME. WHOA! SLOW DOWN! WAIT FOR ME! HOW'S THE DIVING SUIT WORKING, GADGET? A-OKAY. IN FACT, I'D SAY THIS DIVING SUIT IS RANGER READY. HEY! GADGET, ARE YOU OK? NO PROBLEM, CHIP. COMING RIGHT UP. YOU'D THINK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH THEIR MONEY THAN TO THROW IT AWAY. OH, I WISH I MIGHT, OH, I WISH I MAY HAVE THIS BE MY LUCKY DAY. -HEY, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING. -WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? I CAN'T BELIEVE HE THINKS A SILLY RITUAL WILL BRING HIM LUCK. NOW, GADGET, YOU SHOULDN'T GO SNEERING DOWN YOUR LOVELY NOSE AT LUCK. IT'S BAILED US OUT MORE THAN A TIME OR TWO. OH, MAYBE THIS IS MY LUCKY DAY. A FOUR LEAF CLOVER. [MEOW] [MEOW] OH, A-- A BLACK CAT! [GASPS] [BARKING] HELP! WHOA! [CRASH] WHOA! WHOA! HEY! MY INVENTIONS! [MEOW] NOT AGAIN. YAAH! [MEOW] ZIPPER, FOLLOW THAT BRIEFCASE! AYE AYE, MATE. DON'T WORRY, MATES. THAT BLOKE LOOKED HARMLESS ENOUGH. NO PROBLEM. WHAT TROUBLE COULD OUR GADGET POSSIBLY GET INTO? BIG TROUBLE! WELL, HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND THEM? MAYBE WE CAN FIND OUT WHERE THESE CAME FROM. COURSE, FIRST, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT THESE ARE. THANKS, ZIPPER. WOW. OH, I WISH I MIGHT, OH, I WISH I MAY HAVE THIS BE MY LUCKY DAY. OH, WELL. GUESS TODAY'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE MY LUCKY DAY. BUT THEN AGAIN, IT NEVER IS MY LUCKY DAY. MY WONDER BLENDER DOESN'T BLEND, MY PRIMO PASTA PULLER'S PAST ITS PRIME, AND MY WHIRLOMOMETER'S LOST THE WILL TO WHIRL. OH, AND TO THINK THAT ONCE I, CLYDE COSGROVE, WON THE COVETED GOLDEN BLENDER AWARD. BUT I WAS LUCKIER BACK THEN. NOW MY LUCK IS SO BAD, THE MEALOMATIC WILL NEVER BE READY FOR THE KITCHEN APPLIANCE CONVENTION. OH, KISMET, COME TO DADDY. [DING DING DING] [MEOW] OH, KISMET, COME, COME, COME. [MEOW] IS MY LUCKY LITTLE KITTY GOING TO HELP HER DADDY WADDY? [MEOW] OH, THANK YOU. [MEOW] [MEOW] I KNEW YOUR GOOD LUCK WOULD RUB OFF ON MY MEALOMATIC. [MEOW] IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, KISMET. I'M THE FAILURE. POOR GUY. GOLLY, ZIPPER, I THINK WE CAN HELP HIM. IT JUST LOOKS TO ME LIKE COSGROVE JUST HAS A FEW LOOSE SCREWS. BLAST, I CAN'T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OUT OF THIS. HEY, LOOK HERE. I'VE GOT THE SAME THING ON MINE. LOOK IT. WHAT'S IT MEAN? HMM. REMINDS ME OF SOME HIEROGLYPHICS I ONCE SAW ON THE BANKS OF TOLUCA LAKE. COURSE THEY TURNED OUT TO BE JUST THE TOE TRACKS OF A TWO-STEPPING TOLUCA LAKAN TOUCAN. WOW. THESE GO TOGETHER. BLIMEY. AND THEY SPELL GRIBBISH. OF COURSE. GRIBBISH. THAT'S FANTASTIC. UH, WHAT'S A GRIBBISH? PLEASE, ZIPPER, JUST A-- HEY, WHAT HAVE WE HERE? A LITTLE MOUSE. MY VAXISCULPTER, IT WORKS! WHY, YOU'RE EVEN LUCKIER THAN KISMET. [MEOW] [GROWLS] YOU COULD BE JUST WHAT I NEED TO BREAK MY UNLUCKY STREAK. NOW, WHAT CAN I USE FOR A CAGE? [MEOW] COSGROVE! Y-- YES, MR. GRIBBISH? HOW'S OUR LITTLE MEALOMATIC COMING ALONG, COSGROVE? IT'S NOT QUITE READY, SIR. WELL, IT BETTER BE READY IN TIME FOR THE APPLIANCE SHOW THIS AFTERNOON OR YOU'LL BE SLICED AND DICED RIGHT OUT OF THE BUSINESS! YOU DO UNDERSTAND, DON'T YOU? YES, SIR. OH, DEAR, I'M AFRAID IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN A LUCKY MOUSE TO FIX MY MEALOMATIC. I KNOW! I'LL GO BACK TO THE PARK AND FIND THAT FOUR LEAF CLOVER. NOW, KISMET, TAKE CARE OF OUR LITTLE FRIEND. [MEOW] HA HA HA HA HA. WE CAN'T LEAVE YET, ZIPPER. COSGROVE HAS JUST LOST HIS SELF-CONFIDENCE, SO WE'LL HELP HIM FIND IT. AFTER ALL, WE'RE RESCUE RANGERS, AND RESCUE RANGERS HELP PEOPLE. [CRASH] AAH! PLEASE, NOT NOW, ZIPPER. NOW, LET'S SEE. IF I TIGHTEN THIS AND HOOK THIS TO THIS... HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE, ZIPPER. I THINK I'VE ALMOST FIXED IT. ALL I NEED A PAPER CLIP. WHOA! GOLLY, ZIPPER. I ONLY NEEDED ONE. [BANG] SO, THOUGHT YOU'D COME IN AND TAKE OVER, EH, MOUSEY? WELL, THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE LUCKY PET AROUND HERE, AND YOUR LUCK'S JUST RUN OUT. IS THAT ANY REASON TO EAT ME? WELL, THAT, AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE A MOUSE. BUT I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP FIX THOSE BROKEN INVENTIONS. AND JUST WHO DO YOU THINK BROKE ALL THOSE DAZZLING DOODADS, DEARIE? YOU? BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE COSGROVE'S LUCKY KITTY. CAT. WOULD HE NEED ME FOR A GOOD LUCK CHARM IF HE WEREN'T ON A BAD LUCK STREAK? NO! OH, WELL, I GUESS IF YOU DON'T MIND LOSING YOUR MEAL TICKET... MEANING? HOW LONG DO YOU THINK HIS BOSS LET COSGROVE STAY HERE IF HIS INVENTIONS NEVER WORK? IF HE DOESN'T SUCCEED SOON, HE'LL BE OUT ON THE STREET. AND SO WILL I. OKAY, MOUSEY, I'LL LET YOU FIX ONE OF HIS INVENTIONS. BUT THAT'S IT, UNDERSTAND? NOW, YOU'LL PROBABLY NEED THESE. GOLLY, COSGROVE'S MISSING PARTS. [DOOR OPENS] WHY'D THEY HAVE TO PICK TODAY TO MOW THE LAWN? OH, WELL. MY FOUR LEAF CLOVER MUST BE IN HERE SOMEWHERE. [COUGHING] HOW AM I GONNA FIND THE PARTS IN ALL THIS GRASS? WHAT'S THE MATTER, A BIT OF BAD LUCK, MOUSEY? NONSENSE. YOU MAKE YOUR OWN LUCK. AND I'LL PROVE IT. OUCH! SAY, THIS LOOKS LIKE THE CANOOTY VALVE TO MY-- COSGROVE! YES, MR. GRIBBISH, SIR? THE MOVERS WILL BE HERE SOON TO MOVE THE EXHIBITS TO THE CONVENTION SHOWROOM. AND IF THE MEALOMATIC ISN'T READY, THEY'LL MOVE YOU OUT ONTO THE STREET! BUT, BUT, BUT... OKAY, NOW, THE WAY I SEE IT, THIS SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS PIECING TOGETHER A PUZZLE. IF ONLY I KNEW WHAT THE PUZZLE LOOKED LIKE. [PANTING] HOW COME I ALWAYS GET THE TOUGH JOBS? JUST BE THANKFUL APPLIANCES ARE IN THE FRONT OF THE BOOK, MATE. THERE IT IS! GRIBBISH! "GRIBBISH KITCHEN APPLIANCES, 3436 FLOWER STREET." HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S MY TURN TO DRIVE. YOUR TURN? IT'S MY TURN. -MY TURN! -IS NOT! -IS TOO! -MY TURN! NOW, BOYS, LEAVE THE DRIVING TO ME. I'M THE ONE WITH THE EXPERIENCE. WHY, I PILOTED AN AUTOGYRO MADE OF CANADIAN GOOSE FEATHERS AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. [CRASH] EXCEPT EVERY WINTER. THE BLINKING PLANE KEPT HEADING SOUTH! GOLLY, I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHERE ALL THESE LEFTOVER PARTS GO. WELL, THEY DIDN'T ALL COME FROM THE MEALOMATIC, DEARIE. THOSE PARTS WERE FROM ALL THE INVENTIONS I'VE SABOTAGED. OH, I-- UH, I KNEW THAT. WELL, NOTHING A LITTLE HARD WORK CAN'T FIX. SAY, YOU WOULDN'T BE DOING ALL THIS JUST TO MAKE YOURSELF LOOK GOOD, NOW, WOULD YOU, MOUSEY? GOLLY, NO. I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT. [MEOW MEOW] [MEOW MEOW MEOW] I DON'T THINK IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. [MEOW] [MEOW] WELL, AT LEAST SHE'S OKAY. HEY! GOSH, THANKS, ZIPPER. OH, WELL. AT LEAST IT DIDN'T DROP... ME! GOTCHA! NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL LUCKY. I KNEW I NEVER SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED THAT DOUBLE CROSSER. MAYBE IT'S TIME I BROUGHT THAT MOUSEY A LITTLE LUCK. A LITTLE BAD LUCK. [CRASH] BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE THE MEALOMATIC. IT'S NOT READY YET. GRIBBISH SAYS YOU CAN FINISH WORKING ON IT AT THE CONVENTION. BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT... SORRY, GADGET, LOVE. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TOO LATE TO-- WRONG. FOLLOW THAT MOVING VAN. AHH. AHH. OH, I WISH I MIGHT, I WISH I MAY HAVE THIS BE MY LUCKY... UH-OH. WELL, IS IT READY YET, COSGROVE? MR. GRIBBISH, HOW NICE TO SEE YOU. HEH HEH HEH. WITH-- WITH-- WITH ANY LUCK, I-I-I-- I SEE. WELL, I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO PUT ANY UNDUE PRESSURE ON YOU, COSGROVE, BUT THE JUDGES WILL BE AT OUR BOOTH ANY MINUTE NOW, SO STEP ON IT, YOU LUG NUT! BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT... GOLLY, WITH KISMET GONE, COSGROVE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BAD LUCK. IF ONLY I COULD FIND A WAY TO GET HIM TO TRUST HIS OWN TALENTS. WELL, LOVE, GOOD LUCK TO YA. LUCK? I, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. DON'T WORRY. I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO. ME, TOO. SURPRISE. IT WAS SO NICE OF THOSE MOVERS TO GIVE ME A LITTLE LIFT, DON'T YOU THINK, DEARIE? IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE TO SCARE THE RESCUE RANGERS THAN A MEASLY CAT. LIKE MAYBE A MEASLY CAT WITH BIG CLAWS. -COME ON. -BUT I GOT TO HELP COSGROVE FIX-- [MEOW] [MEOW] WHEW. AND NOW TO TAKE CARE OF THAT MEDDLING MOUSE MECHANIC. SO, YOU WANT TO PLAY CAT AND MOUSEY? WHOA! [GRUNTS] KISMET, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET AWAY FROM THAT MOUSE. GOSH, KISMET, I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THIS. OH, BUT I DO. -[GASPS] -[LAUGHS] LOOKS LIKE THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SKIN A MOUSE, EH, DEARIE? I WARNED YOU, KISMET. SORRY, MOUSEY. THIS JUST ISN'T YOUR LUCKY DAY. [MEOW] [MEOW] HA HA HA HA HA. ARE YOU OKAY, LITTLE MOUSEY? HEY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? I FIXED IT WITHOUT A GOOD LUCK DANCE OR A FOUR LEAF CLOVER OR ANYTHING. MAYBE I JUST NEEDED A BETTER REASON TO SUCCEED. COSGROVE, WHERE'S THAT-- MEALOMATIC. COME ON, COSGROVE. THE JUDGES ARE WAITING. AHH. I KNEW MY MEALOMATIC WOULD BE A SUCCESS. AFTER ALL, IT WAS MY IDEA, MY KNOW-HOW, MY INGENUITY. STOP THAT! TURN THIS THING OFF! HOW DO YOU THINK OL' COSGROVE GOT THAT CONTRAPTION TO WORK SO FAST? JUST LUCKY, I GUESS. [END MUSIC PLAYING]
