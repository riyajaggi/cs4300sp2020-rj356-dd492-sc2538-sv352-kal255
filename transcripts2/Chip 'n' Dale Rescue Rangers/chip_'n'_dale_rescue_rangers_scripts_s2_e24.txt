 ♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'n Dale ♪ When there's danger ♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'n Dale ♪ MONTEREY: There I was, surrounded on all sides by cannibal cats. They strung me up by me tail over a pot of boilin' water, and made ready to cook me up right then and there. Gee, Monterey, weren't you scared? Scared? Who, me? Monterey Jack doesn't know the meaning of the word. Why, I just slipped the knot and splashed 'em all in the pot before I took off. Ha! Zowie! Hey, Monterey, there's a letter here for you. A letter? For me? The postmark says it's from a place called Tramplonia. Tramplonia? (LAUGHING) That's a silly name for a place. Who is it from, Monterey? Why, it's from me old pal, Don Quijole. I haven't seen him in a cat's age. What's he say? Seems his village is under attack, and he wants me to come right away. MONTEREY: Some kind of emergency. Well, if there's any trouble involved, Monterey Jack'll take care of it. (EXCLAIMS) Well, sure, matey, I can handle anything with the help of my friends here. To the Ranger Wing! CHIP: Rescue Rangers, away! GADGET: Gosh, Monty, this looks more like a party than an emergency. That's not just a party, Gadget, love. It's the Runnin' of the Bulls. Their biggest day of the year. People come to Tramplonia from miles around. I thought we came all this way because your friend said his village was under attack. (FLAMENCO MUSIC PLAYING) (MEN WHOOPING) The bulls! Bring on the bulls! Looks to me like it's holding out pretty well. (GASPS) Look at that. (ZIPPER SQUEAKING) MONTEREY: It's a war zone. Just like me pal Don Quijole said in his note. Every mouse in town is afraid for his life. GADGET: Something sure has frightened them. CHIP: But why are only the mice being attacked? DALE: Yeah, those people back there looked fine. You've come at last. I knew you would come. Don Quijole. My friend. Your letter said, "Come right away," so me mates and I got here as fast as we could. What happened? It looks like a twister came through here. He has returned. The evil one. The great bull, El Emenopio! What a silly name for a bull. (LAUGHING) This time he attacks only us small animals. He began trampling our homes as we prepared for the holiday. El Monty Grande! (ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) I thought his name was Monterey Jack. Yeah, Monty, what's going on? (CHUCKLING) It's no big deal, mates. Uh, just a little dust-up a few years back. Ah, do not be modest, my old friend. Your companions must be told the story of El Monty Grande. I'm surprised, Monty. I thought we had heard all your stories. Yeah, several times. Well, I... Yeah, how'd you get that silly name? It was many years ago, during our beloved Running of the Bulls. QUIJOLE: For centuries the bulls have run through the streets of Tramplonia, bringing to us much happiness and joy. (ALL CHEERING) But then, he came. The largest, meanest bull in all of Spain. (BELLOWING) First our bulls ran away, then the people. He was furious because he was the only bull not invited to the festival. (BELLOWING) Then a mysterious stranger stepped out of the shadows. It was El Monty Grande. (BELLOWING) El Monty Grande stood his ground as the great bull charged. (CRASHING)  And then... (GROANING) (SIGHING) (EL EMENOPIO MOOING) (BELLOWING) El Monty Grande defeated the great bull and the festival was saved. From that day on, El Emenopio never dared show his face in Tramplonia again. Until now. But El Monty Grande has returned to save us. Well, uh, I don't know. Uh... That's our Monterey Jack. Gee, Monty, I never knew you s-saved a whole town. There's a lot of luck in any victory, Dale, me lad. I have saved El Monty Grande's cape and hat from the day of his great victory. Oh, you shouldn't have kept these old things. Thank you for coming to help us, El Monty Grande. Please accept this small token of our thanks. No, I can't. Thank you, but I can't... Cheese! (SLURPING) BOTH: We love you, El Monty Grande! (GULPING) Oh, boy! Don't worry. El Monty Grande and I are gonna take care of ol' Lemon Pio in no time. Th-That's what being heroes is all about. Thanks for volunteerin' me, Dale. Thanks, but no thanks. Gosh, what's wrong with Monty? I've never seen him like this. (SQUEAKING) If I didn't know him better, I'd say he was afraid of that bull. Monterey Jack afraid? Ha! (BELLS TOLLING) It is time for the Running of the Bulls. Well, come on. (IN SPANISH ACCENT) Bring on the bulls. (ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) The bulls will come from the north. The bulls. The bulls. (SCREAMING) Watch it, mate. You don't want a closer seat than this. (WIND WHISTLING) (ALL CHATTERING CURIOUSLY) What's wrong? The bulls. They have been stolen. (ALL GASPING) This is also the work of El Emenopio. I am sure of it. His hatred of our festival is so great. All right, where is he? Let me at him! No bully bull is safe from El Dale Grande! Don't worry, Don Quijole. The Rescue Rangers will help to... Yeah, me and El Monty Grande never fail. Come on. I wish the lad would take it easy. We can't just rush into this thing. (RUSTLING) No bulls here. I don't see any sign of a struggle. There wouldn't be, Chipper. The local bulls would've been too scared of El Emenopio. (SQUEAKING EXCITEDLY) Good work, Zipper. Uh, no bulls here. Come on, dummy, Zipper found something outside. Hey, wait for me. (SQUEAKING) Wagon tracks. And they look like they were made very recently. Uh, where? Dale. Are you all right? I'm okay. Now, who'd go and dig a hole in the middle of a field? That's no hole, Chipper. That's a hoofprint. And there's only one animal I know who could've left it. CHIP: The tracks lead up here. GADGET: What kind of place is this? DALE: Uh, I think it's a supermarket. There's the meat department. ALL: The bulls! Someone's come. Oh, do hurry. I fear we've missed the festival already. Please get us out before he gets back. No problem. We'll just... (EL EMENOPIO BELLOWING) Oh, dear! I knew you would come. El Emeno... (STAMMERING) El Emeno... El Monty Grande would not desert his old friends in trouble. That's why he attacked the mice, to get Monty here. (SQUEAKING) Now, I'll destroy you and that miserable festival, and get my revenge. Well, Dale, here's your chance to be a hero. Come on, Monty, now's our chance to be big heroes. Uh, Dale, lad, there's somethin' you should know about. I guess El Dale Grande is gonna have to handle this big bully all by himself. Dale! Wait! Now I got you. I'll hog-tie this big old cow. El Emenopio will flatten him. Hang on, Dale. We're coming. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) Retreat! MONTEREY: Go for that door! It's our only hope! (MOOING ANGRILY) (ALL GRUNTING) (GROANING) Where are we? (GASPING) Safe for now. Where's Chip? (ZIPPER SQUEAKING) Thanks, Zipper. (SQUEAKING) You're welcome. Now what? Yeah, Monty. How'd you take care of this bull last time? I guess I better tell you about what really happened back then. I had just scored a hunk of jalapeno when ol' El Emenopio took me by surprise. (MOANING) I was clearly no match for him and decided to make a run for it. Unfortunately, I had a run-in with one of the local merchants. Adios! Whoa! The other mice couldn't see what really happened. (ALL CHEERING) I will have my revenge. ALL: El Monty Grande. El Monty Grande. That chunk of cheese saved ol' Monterey Jack's hide, and I've been grateful ever since. One thing's for certain. I didn't defeat that bull. It doesn't matter, Monty. We've been in tougher spots before, but we always find a way to work it out together. (SQUEAKING) Maybe we can cut that bully of a bull down to size. Monty, help me get some of this junk together. Good idea, Gadget. I'll go find El Dale Dummy. This hero stuff is great. If Monterey took care of Lemon Pio, so can El Dale Grande. Great. He's sleeping. How can I be a big hero if he's asleep? Hey! Wake up, you b-b-big bully. Huh? Rise and shine. (GRUNTING) (GROWLING) (GASPING) CHIP: Maybe Dale really is a great hero. Nah. Something's screwy around here. (WHISTLES) Dale, come on. Gadget needs help with her plan. Can't you see I've got my hands full? Besides, a hero doesn't need a st-stupid old plan. Dale, run! I guess I'm the only real hero around here. (SCREAMING) You messed up my heroing. All I messed up was your funeral. He was gonna stomp you. -Was not. -Was so. (BELLOWING) Oh, dear. I can't bear to watch. Dale, he's coming! Come on. Let's go. I don't care. If you wanna go, that's... (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Why didn't you say something? CHIP: Why wouldn't you listen? Uh, anyway, we're safe up here. (SAWING) What was that? The tree's getting shorter! So what are we gonna do now, Mr. Big Hero? Maybe ol' Lemon Pio would like to talk things over. Maybe not. Come out. I know you are in there. (SLURPING) BOTH: Coochie coochie coo! (SNEEZING) Stay still. He'll never find us here. D-Do you think he saw us? (BOTH EXCLAIMING) GADGET: Toss me that small pulley, will you, Monty? Anything you want, Gadget, love. But if I were you, I'd speed it up a bit. This would go a lot faster if I had my own tools. I hardly had enough time to draw up the proper blueprints. You made blueprints? Sure, how do you expect me to build a complicated device like this without the proper plans? Grab that broom over there, will you? Righto, Gadget, but I don't think we need to worry about keepin' the place clean. After all, it was trashed out long before we got here. No, Monty. I need a hand. I thought I was helpin' you. I mean, a whole arm. Now stick the end of that broom through here. Sure glad you know what you're talkin' about, love, 'cause I don't have the slightest clue. Hold the knot, will you, Zipper? Thanks. (GRUNTING) Just what are we makin' here anyway? GADGET: We're building a real hero. This way El Emenopio will have to pick on someone his own size. I'm sure Chip and Dale would be happy to hear that. But I'm not the one to tell 'em. (GROWLING) We got to get back to the others. Yeah, but how, with that bully bully down there? Maybe we could disguise ourselves. Hey, I know. We'll eat our way out. (CHOMPING) But I'm not hungry. Besides, shouldn't we be thinking up a disguise? Stop gabbing and start chomping. CHIP: Hurry, we got to make it to the store now. DALE: I'm right behind you, wherever you are. (SCREAMING) Chipper, help! What's wrong now? Dale. (DALE SCREAMING) (GROWLING) Here he comes again. Gadget, love, I hope this contraption of yours works. I'm startin' to get worried about the lads. Monty, look! We're too late. What are we gonna do? You tell me. You're the big hero. They're shish kebab for sure! (SQUEAKING ANGRILY) (HOWLING) Where'd he get me, Chip? Is it bad? Come on. We've been saved. MONTEREY: Ooh, ooh, ooh! That's puttin' a bug in his ear, Zipper. DALE: Let's g-get out of here. Not quite yet, Dale, me lad. Heroing's a tough business, but together we might just stand a chance. I think we just got our old Monty back. Hop inside, guys, and I'll show you how this thing works. Or, at least, how it's supposed to work. MONTEREY: All right, you moth-eaten excuse for an overnight bag. Let's see if you're as dumb as you were in the old days. (BELLOWING) Huh? Good work, Gadget. If there's one thing a bull can't stand, it's a red cape. Not the red cape. MONTEREY: Come and get me. Silly tricks. El Monty Grande is a coward as he always was. All right, Gadget. Ready? You bet. Now, how long will it take me to turn this pitiful thing into toothpicks? GADGET: Now Plan A. (THUMPING) CHIP: Good work, Gadget. Take a bow, Gadget, love. (MOANING) Chip, Dale, dig his feet in tight. (EXCLAIMING) GADGET: Hurry, Dale. Plan A didn't stop him, but Plan B should finish the job. I sure hope so. I don't care much for bein' a sittin' target. (ALL SCREAMING) I'm not so sure we got the best of that. Can you guys keep him busy a minute? Plan C isn't quite ready. BOTH: What? (BELLOWING) I'll have the coordinates soon. Till then just... Well, run! Now, let's see, the cotangent of the trajectory should equal the square root of the determinant times four. Or was it times three? Um, uh, Gadget, love, about this Plan C you're workin' on... Now to finish the job. (GRINDING) I've got it! Plan C! It's about time. Okay. Chip, Dale, move us three steps forward. GADGET: Lean slightly to the left. A little more. Now plant the right foot, bend the left knee and... (RINGING) (STAMMERING) Where's Lemon Pio? Up there! Just where I planned. They did it. What darling little animals. Come on. There's still time to get those bulls back to the festival before dark. (GRUNTING) (ALL CHEERING) QUIJOLE: Never, for 500 years, have the bulls failed to run. (SIGHING) I suppose the evil one was too strong, even for El Monty Grande. Monty! Look out! Look out! Where are the bulls? Over there. Oh, my! We're free. BOTH: The bulls. Our festival is saved. El Monty Grande. (EL EMENOPIO BELLOWING) Oh, no. QUIJOLE: The evil one. El Monty Grande will take care of him. Hey, I got you at last. Back for more, eh? (GROANING) ALL: Hooray for El Monty Grande! Well, we helped Monty's friends and saved the festival. (SCOFFING) GADGET: They sure seem happy. WOMEN: Three cheers for El Monty Grande! I don't see what's so specially grande  about Monty. ALL: Monty! Monty! Monty! He's no big hero. We did just as much as he did. I guess he's just the kind to hog all the attention. Thank you, El Dale Grande. (CHUCKLING) Gosh, it was nothing.
