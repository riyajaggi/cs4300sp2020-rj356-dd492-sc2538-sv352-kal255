 ♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'n Dale ♪ When there's danger ♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'n Dale ♪ NARRATOR: Previously on Chip 'n Dale's Rescue Rangers. There goes the ruby. CHIP: And any hope of clearing Detective Drake. I know how we can fly after them. I'm Gadget. Oh, you know that already. Hmm. What comes next? Now, let's show them what you've got. What's that loony up to? They'll never laugh at Norton Nimnul again. They're onto us now, mates. Grab that ruby and let's run. (ALL SCREAMING) Strike! Ooh! I hate high places! Wait till we hit the low ones. (SQUEAKING) It's no go, Zipper! Save yourself! (GRUNTS) (SHRIEKS) (SQUEAKING) Gadget! Hang on, guys. I think this'll work. Think what will work? Oh, good. It didn't throw you into the trunk. I'm so glad. Hey, what... Gadget, you did it! You fixed the Screaming Eagle. Sort of. The plane was such a wreck, I had to redesign it with bits of trash from Klordane's camp. Kind of unique, don't you think? Well, it's one of a kind, all right. But what kind of a kind is it? NIMNUL: Come on, Mr. Glacier, just a little bit farther. (LAUGHING) Bingo. Perfect parking job. And to think they wouldn't give me a driver's license. Now, all we have to do is get down to the train tracks and greet the choo-choo. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (BRAKES SQUEALING) Destroy, obliterate, puree, whip, chop. (NIMNUL LAUGHING) I'll have that glacier reduced to snow cone stuffing in no time at all. I'm absolutely thrilled. Sleep tight, laser light. Don't let the computer bugs bite. The geek has a definite hardware hang-up. I bet stripping gears is his idea of a good time. GADGET: What could they need all that ice for? A really big glass of lemonade? Detective Drake can figure it out when he's released, after we get the ruby back to the police station. CHIP: So let's grab it and go. Now, that's my kind of talk. Man the tomatoes and full seed ahead! MONTEREY: Toora-loo! This bird can stop on a dime and give you nine cents change. CHIP: Let's work fast, before Nimnul and Fat Cat return. That looks like the release button up there. (GRUNTING) What's going on? -The ruby! -But how? I've taken care of them twice! Take your wretched rodent paws off my ruby. Get them! MONTEREY: Grab on, mates. (SOBBING) They're getting away. All right, Gadget, take us home. Right. Next stop, home. Uh, as soon as you tell me where it is. At least someone has a home to go back to. (BIRD TWITTERING) (SNORING) Forty-five years in the department and no one believes that I didn't steal the ruby. KLORDANE: Oh, I believe you. But that's because I'm the one who did. Klordane! You rotten, low-down, scheming... Come, come, Drake, that's no way to treat an old friend. I just got back into town from up north, and I brought you a little present. See? Oh, I dropped it. Hey, what's that? Somebody get in here. (COUGHING) It's... It's gas! Oh, my, he's fainted. I better get him some fresh air. (EXPLOSION) What was that? (GASPING) It's a breakout! SALLY: Detective Drake's escaped. Oh, my head. KLORDANE: Excellent. Detective Drake has decided to rejoin us. If he's going to take the rap for my brilliant scheme, I want him awake to appreciate it. I'm not taking a rap for anyone. Ah, our ride's here. (TRAIN HORN BLOWING) DRAKE: At least tell me where I am, Klordane. With pleasure. It's one of your fair city's subway entrances. We're about to go underground. Impressed, Drake? I had it brought down from the Arctic. Professor Nimnul, will you please come out here? Y-Yes, Mr. Klordane? We'd like a demonstration of how our ruby is going to make me rich. Uh, sir, uh, the ruby appears to be in a, um, transitive state of location. Meaning? It's missing. Missing? Missing? Well, you see, there were these small Rodentia, uh, chipmunks, to be precise, and... Chipmunks? Chipmunks? (CHUCKLING) You know, as a policeman, I could file a missing ruby report for you. That won't be necessary. Professor Nimnul is going to either bring me that ruby or I'll get an elephant gun. But, Plato, I can't believe Detective Drake would run away. (SNEEZES) Yeah. He's our hero. I'm sure he didn't run away, lads. He mu-- He must have gone after Klordane. (GROANING) And I'm not with him. Uh, now that we returned the ruby to the evidence room, they'll probably let you go. Yeah. And then we can all go after Klordane. And that cat. Yes! Well, I don't have anything else to do, and this is so much fun. I cannot believe the ruby robber was allowed to escape. But your ruby turned up, Mrs. Clutchcoin. I'm not sure how. Detective Drake isn't even a suspect anymore. Indeed? Then why is he a fugitive? Isn't it time you brought Mrs. Clutchcoin her ruby? Yeah, right. Be quick about it. My darling Poopsie shouldn't be exposed to this ruffian environment. CLUTCHCOIN: He's far too sensitive. Good afternoon, Officer. (HUMMING) (LAUGHING) The ruby's in there. Still in perfect pitch. All right, get in there and give me a diversion so I can get the ruby. And if you see those rodents in there, take care of them this time. Sorry, Plato. This chain is a lot stronger than it looks. Well, thank you for trying, Miss Gadget. I suppose it's up to Detective Drake to solve this by himself. (SQUEAKING) Oh, my gosh! It's Fat Cat. He must be back to nab the ruby. The nerve. Well, he won't get away this time. No, Plato. That's how this whole mess got started. Let us do it. We've handled him before. Yeah. He's a pushover. Hmm. Now, what we need is a good diversion. Ah. My favorite kind of victim. Yeah. A dog. Gadget, you tangle up his feet with your harpoon. Can do, Chip. Monterey Jack, you pull the rope to trip him so Dale and I can knock him out. We're gonna clobber him. There's the signal. All right, just let me adjust the trajectory, Monty, and then it's up to you. Don't worry, you can count on me. (GASPING) Cheese! (GRUNTS) Not again! Eh? What's this? (SQUEAKING) Crikeys. I gotta do somethin' about these cheese attacks. You know, we really can't go on meeting like this, so we won't. Ah. Here's the officer with your ruby, Mrs. Clutchcoin. Well, it's about time. Oh. What's keeping that cat? I'm going to miss my chance. Sorry, mates. Have you out in a pop. (GROWLING) Careful, Plato. You'll work yourself into a lather. (MUMBLING) Now open wide. Wh-Where's my Poopsie? Poopsie! MAYOR: It's a mad dog. Don't let it get away. It's dangerous. You will see to it that that beast is taken to the pound. I want that animal destroyed! Let's see. Since the sun sets in the west, the pound should be right... Back over there. (ALL SCREAMING) Hey, watch it, Gadget, love. I almost left my stomach back there. Speaking of stomachs, yours got us into trouble again. Oh, it was just a little cheese attack. No need to get your fur up. No, Chip's right. Your goofing around almost got us killed. Oh, gangin' up on me, eh? Well, Monterey Jack never backed down from a dust-up in his life. Easy, Monty. Just listen to me for a second. That's all you ever want us to do, listen to you. But... I don't listen to anyone. I'm footloose and fancy-free. "Come and go as you please," that's my motto. So what do I need you flapdoodles for? A home. A family. (STAMMERING) I... I don't need anybody. -Monty! -Monty! You know, suddenly, the plane seems to handle lighter. Monty just jumped out. Oh. That would account for it. It's no use. CHIP: We'll never get -(SNORING) -into the dog pound this way. I think I can get us in. It's just a matter of finding the harmonic weakness in the glass. Oh, here it is. There you go. It was just a simple matter of applying ceramic stress coefficients. (DOG SNARLING) (GROWLING) Now, there's a dog who belongs in the pound. (IN FRENCH ACCENT) No dog belongs in the pound. Oh, pardonnez-moi.  My name is Frenchy. I am from France. And this is my compatriot, K. Sera. Sera. Sorry, K. Sera. Sera. The "K" stands for Killer. Now, what's a nice mouse like you doing in a pound like this, huh? We're here to rescue our friend Plato. A rescue. You are in luck. I am captain of the PU. The Pound Underground. Right, K. Sera? Sera. Dedicated to liberating canines throughout the known world. Golly, how many members are there? Well, there's me, of course, and then K. Sera. Sera. -And? -And... Hmm. Did I mention me? There's only two members? We also have tunnels. What more do you need to be underground? Wowie-zowie! Ready, K. Sera? Sera. One moment,  mes amis. Apres vous. To think I let Fat Cat use me twice. It's criminal. I deserve to be behind bars. Bonsoir, mon ami. Your liberation is at hand. Hello. Hiya, Plato. Lads! By Jove, but it's good to see you. But you shouldn't have come. That guard dog could have finished you. Ah! To see comrades reunited. My heart swells with swelling. But now, we throw off the chains of oppression. We begin the tunnel out of here. Eh, K. Sera? Sera. -We've come to rescue you. -Yeah. You have to find Detective Drake. What's the point? Klordane and Fat Cat are too much for us. Huh? But--But you and Detective Drake are the best. (GRUNTS) They're manipulating us like puppets. Detective Drake is a fugitive and that cat trapped me as easily as a newborn pup. (GROANING) It's hopeless. Hopeless? But you said, "Never give up." Dash! It's time to be realistic, lad. Oh. You were just making up all that stuff about justice and helping others. -You were? -Well, I... Well, we're not giving up. We're not? No. We're not. We're gonna get that ruby back and save Detective Drake. Amazing! It takes a pair of chipmunks to make a police dog see his duty. Hey, we were taught by the best. Thank you, Chip. (CLEARING THROAT) Well, what's your plan? First, since Frenchy is nowhere around, we'll need the key to this cage. That will mean getting past the sleeping guard dog. (SNORING) Careful, lads. His bite is worse than his bark, and even his bark will freeze your fur. (SNARLING) So, you thought you'd get away that easy? (GROWLING) PLATO: Leave them alone! You've no call to bully them. It's my job, gramps. I'm a guard dog. And I don't need any advice from a has-been cop. Besides, I consider catching tasty trespassers like these just one of my executive perks. (RUMBLING) Aha! Liberation at last! Smell the sweet fragrance of freedom. (INHALING) Curious. Freedom smells much like a dog pound. (SOBBING) We have failed to escape, K. Sera. Sera. CHIP: Let's get that key. But, Frenchy, you saved us from the guard dog. Is that who fell past us? I thought he was awfully rude. (CHUCKLING) But of course, we intended it so, for we are the Pound Underground. Hurry, before the guard dog comes back. I'm doing as best I can. Take it away, Chipper. Steady as she goes! (GRUNTING) I think you had better slow down now, Chip. Chip? Chip! Plato, is Dale all right? No problem. I'm just fine. (DOG BARKING) FRENCHY: Head for the foothills, mes amis. Hang on. This is going to be rough. (SNARLING) -Come on, Plato. Get up. -We gotta get going. Just need a moment to catch my breath. Looks like we don't have a moment. MONTEREY: Hold on, pally. I'm havin' a two-for-one sale. It's Monterey Jack. Right you are. But we best be goin'. Sleepin' Beauty back there won't be out for long. Then climb aboard, friend. There's still a bit of steam left in the Plato Express. Tip-top. No sign of pursuit. But why did you come back, Monterey Jack? Oh. You know I hate to miss a good fight. Couldn't let you hog it all. (SQUEAKING) Monty! And I was worried about you. (SQUEAKING) And? And... All right, I have nowhere else to go. Well, we're glad you came back. You'll always have a place with us. FRENCHY: Vive la France! The forces of liberty have triumphed once again. We couldn't have done it without you and K. Sera. Sera. Pardonnez-moi, mon ami. My little friend is anxious to free the other dogs. But perhaps one day, the Pound Underground can work with your team again. Team? Oh, we aren't really a team. Are we? Yeah, I guess we are. Maybe one day we will work with you. Then we will leave it at that. You know what they say.  Que sera... SERA: Sera. Let's go, team. We've got a case to solve. Gadget, I've never been one to stand in the way of technology, but I think the pound might have been safer than this. Don't worry, Plato. It won't be long now. What makes you so sure we'll find Drake this way? Because if we find the glacier ice, we'll find Klordane. And that's who Detective Drake will be looking for. We're getting warmer. Well, uh, I mean colder. Um, close to the glacier, I mean. Golly. We're getting really cold now. Look out! GADGET: Ejection seats. Gadget, love, next time, do you think you can steer around obstacles like this? CHIP: Klordane must have hidden the glacier underground. Splendid bit of detection, Chip. We'll trap them underground like the rats they are. (STAMMERING) No offense. Hey, wait for me. Uh-oh. (SCREAMING) You know, I like that bloke. (THUDDING) Always game to get into the fray. Why would Klordane need all that ice down here? I don't know, but this is where the cold air is coming from. Right. Stand aside and let me have a whack at it. (PLATO CLEARING THROAT) This calls for a bit more muscle than you can muster, Monterey. My father was the rugby mascot at Oxford. I remember a few moves. Gosh, Plato, are you okay? Never better, Dale. I guess this old pooch has some spunk left in him yet. -(WOOD CREAKING) -Maybe a little too much. PERCY: Something happened. KLORDANE: Take care of it. I'm too close to be stopped now. PERCY: Hey, it's Drake's dog. Wonderful! A little icing for my cake. (KLORDANE LAUGHING) (NARRATOR SPEAKING)
