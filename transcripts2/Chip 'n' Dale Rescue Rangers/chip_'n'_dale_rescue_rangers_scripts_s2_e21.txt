 ♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'n Dale ♪ When there's danger ♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'n Dale ♪ (BIRDS CHIRPING) CHIP: Boy, just look at all that junk. GADGET: That isn't junk. Those are science projects the kids built for the fair. A fair? Oh, boy, oh, boy! I wanna go on the rollercoaster. Not that kind of fair, dummy. A science fair. When it's over, the kids throw away all kinds of neat inventions. GADGET: Once I found a perpetual motion machine just lying in a trash can. Of course, by then it had stopped moving. Cheese! Now that's what I call a science project. (SLURPING) (BOTH SCREAMING) (STATIC CRACKLING) Crikey! Talk about sharp cheddar. Golly! An electrical cheese tester. Did you know that mozzarella conducts electricity twice as well as provolone? Gosh, I hope they throw this away when the fair is over. Quick, hide! Does he look familiar to you? Oh, no! This thing won't work without a record. Marvin won't mind if I borrow this, especially since he won't know. He's a blinkin' thief! I know I've seen him somewhere before. My project's better than yours. I'll bet it's not. I worked three months on this. My uncle made my project, and he's an unappreciated genius. He told me so himself. Quick, get down! Hello, Marvin. Can you tell us about your project? (CLEARING THROAT) I've recorded sounds of the city on my homemade recording machine. But why don't I let it speak for itself? (GASPING) My record's gone! I must have left it at home. But it really does work! No, honest, I really did make a record. Marvin, get ahold of yourself. We'll come back later. Maybe you can find your record by then. M-Maybe I left it in my locker. Tsk, tsk. Some children just can't take the pressure of ruthless competition. And what do you have to show us, Normie? A molecular audio empathizer. Oh, sounds impressive. What does it do? Uh, stuff. MARVIN ON RECORD: Hi. You're listening to a homemade record... Whoops! ...made on Marvin's... (RECORD SCRATCHING)  ...now play an assortment of sound effects. Listen. Move it, mates. She's gonna blow. We're lucky it's only oatmeal. Could use a little cinnamon, though. Giving a record player a fancy name doesn't make it a science project. But... But it... That's another F for you, Normie. But it... Uncle Norton wouldn't invent a stupid record player. Maybe if I cranked up the volume. (CHUCKLING) (ENGINE REVVING) (ALL SCREAMING) This is crazy! Oh, I get it. Hey, this is fun. Look out! What in Einstein is going on? (SCREAMING) (GIGGLING) MONTEREY: Batten down your hatches! There's a whale of a storm a-brewin'! CHIP: Run for it! (ALL SCREAMING) (GLASS BREAKING) (WIND HOWLING) GADGET: Don't worry. Whirlwinds like this don't usually last very long. See what I mean? (QUACKING) Wow! This fair had some good rides after all. (SIGHING) Next science fair we go to, remind me to bring my swimsuit. Or at least a towel. You'll feel different about it (HAIR DRYER WHIRRING) when we go back. -Go back? -Go back? Sure. We've gotta get Marvin's record back to him. Marvin might grow up to be a great scientist someday. A setback like this could really frazzle him. (BEEPING) (NIMNUL CACKLING) In a few moments, the entire city will be in my power. Walls will crumble, people will run screaming into the streets, and the voice of Nimnul will be heard throughout the land. (DOORBELL RINGING) (GROANING) Wouldn't you know it? Just when I'm about to create havoc! (MACHINE WHIRRING STOPS) (DOORBELL RINGING) If it's not one of my nosy neighbors, it's little girls selling cookies. Gotta get a dog, or a Bengal tiger or something. (DOORBELL RINGING) All right, already, I'm coming! I... Normie! Why aren't you at school? The science fair was postponed for repairs. (GIGGLING) (GROANING) I suppose it's just as well. I'm about to flatten the whole city anyway. (GIGGLING) (EXCLAIMING) Flatten the school first, Uncle Norton. Maybe the teachers are still there. When I throw this lever, the entire city will be in my power. Walls will crumble, people will... Well, you--you get the idea. No! Now what? Everything seems all right here. No! That can't be! Somebody's stolen the molecular audio empathizer. What sort of sneaking, dishonest, conniving... NIMNUL: Normie! (BEEPING) (NORMIE MUTTERING) Haven't I told you never to play with my super-weapons? You could devastate yourself. I just borrowed it for the science fair. Ow! You march right back to school, young man, and get that molecular audio empathizer. (SCREAMS) And don't stop to play on the way. (THUDDING) NORMIE: Yes, Uncle Norton. CHIP: Let's get Marvin's record and get out of here. Do you think this gizmo might have caused all that crazy stuff to happen? That's silly. No school project could've done that. Still, there is a lot of neat stuff in here. I wonder if they'll throw it away. (GADGET SCREAMING) Gadget! GADGET: No problem. I'll be out in a jiffy. (NORMIE GIGGLING) Golly, it's very interesting in here. Dark, too. (BOTH GASPING) (ALL GRUNTING) It's stuck, mates. Yeah, and so is Gadget. CHIP: He's taking Gadget with him. How are we gonna catch him? MONTEREY: Depend on old Monterey. Just a trick I learned from a flyin' squirrel. Nip out the window and tie this to the kid's bike. (SQUEAKING) Right. (BUZZING) Me and the squirrels used to glide over Frostbite Falls lookin' for mooseberries. What are we waiting for? Nothin'. (MONTEREY SCREAMING) (GASPING) Welcome aboard, Zipper, me lad. (PANTING) Why can't he live in the suburbs like everyone else? Whoa! He took Gadget inside. How are we gonna get in? In? How are we gonna get down? No problem, pally. We'll just take in the sails. (GRUNTING) (ALL SCREAMING) Golly, that thing could use seatbelts. Hold on. This here's the little boy's record. When I throw this lever, the entire city will be in my power. People will run screaming into the... We know all that stuff, Uncle Norton. Get to the good part. Oh, all right. MARVIN ON RECORD: Hi. You're listening to a homemade record made on Marvin's recording machine. (RECORD SCRATCHING) There's something wrong. What? NIMNUL: That isn't the right record. Where's the record I had on here this morning? Did you do something with it? It wasn't my fault, Uncle Norton. It was a boy named Marvin. He broke the record. He's bad. He's always bein' mean to me. Oh, never mind. I have another copy. That voice. My molecular audio empathizer is simple complexity at its finest. If I played, say, a lullaby, it would make the entire city take a nice, restful nap. (LAUGHING) We certainly wouldn't want that, would we? It's Professor Nimnul. That's why the kid looks familiar. GADGET: If it's Nimnul, he must be up to no good. DALE: Yeah, but what kind of no good? Uh. Here it is. Music to devastate the globe by. In stereo. (NIMNUL LAUGHING) Side 1 alone should be enough to level the entire city. Level the city? We've gotta do something. I've got an idea. Hold this, mate. Come on. (GRUNTING) We'll switch records so as it plays somethin' harmless. I was always partial to boogie-woogie myself. Yeah. Now that's a hit record. Are you okay, Monty? Come on, let's get this thing up there. Okey-dokey. That does it. Now we just have to move that thing. When I pull this lever, the entire city will... (WHIMPERS) Oh, never mind. (ALL SCREAMING) He passed out. He'll be needled to death. Monterey Jack, cheese! Cheese? Where? Where? That's a right dirty trick to play on a fella. (ALL SIGHING) (UPBEAT PIANO PLAYING ON RECORD) Gee, Uncle Norton, why do you want to destroy the city? Because nobody really takes a mad scientist seriously until he's leveled a city or two. But once I've proven my power, I'll have the whole world in my sway! NORMIE: Is the city in your sway, Uncle Norton? No. It's just swaying. That can't be the right record. For one thing, utter devastation always has more drums and cymbals. All right, let's shut this thing down. Rescue Rangers, away! Wow! City Hall sure can boogie. Golly! Which lever turns it off? Hit them all. Geronimo! (UPBEAT PIANO PLAYING ON RECORD) Hey, what gives? (ALL GRUNTING) Oh, boy! Defenseless little animals. (PANTING) It's no good. It's stuck. We're just not heavy enough. Prepare to meet your doom, you pitiful creatures. (MUSIC STOPS) Normie, what are you doing? Let's vamoose. No. I got an idea. Norman, why did you pull those levers down? I-It wasn't me, Uncle Norton. It was those animals. The little-bitty... No, no. Big! Big killer rats! These are delicate instruments of destruction! If you don't know how to use them, you could hurt somebody. But, Uncle Norton, the doors aren't open. And now, number one on the charts. MARVIN ON RECORD: My machine will now play an assortment of sound effects. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLARING) Oh, no! Gotta throw the switch! G-G-G-Golly! I feel like a pogo stick with the hiccups. (WIND HOWLING) We've gotta find Chip and Dale! Let's go before the whole place blows away. Gee, Uncle Norton, I better be getting back to school. You can forget about your allowance this week, Normie! (CREAKING) (THUDDING) My record! Somebody found it! And it won some kind of prize. First prize for saving the city. Marvin's science project sure brought down the house. Yeah, Nimnul's house. (GIGGLING) (THUDDING)
