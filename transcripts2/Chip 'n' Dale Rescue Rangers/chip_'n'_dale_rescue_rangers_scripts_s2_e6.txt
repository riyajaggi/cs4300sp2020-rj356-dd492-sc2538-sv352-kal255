BUT, BOSS, WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO THROW AT HIM. AAH! [SQUAWK] AAH! WHERE IS IT? I CAN'T SEE. THE FOG'S TOO THICK. QUICKLY! INTO THE BOAT! KEEP ROWING. WE HAVE TO FIND IT BEFORE IT DRIFTS TOO FAR. THAT'S FAT CAT, ALL RIGHT. WONDER WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR? BONZER JOBSIT! WONDER WHAT IT IS? WHATEVER IT IS, IF FAT CAT WANTS IT, IT PROBABLY MEANS TROUBLE FOR US. LET'S HAVE A GANDER. TOO-RA-LOO! A LAMP RIGHT OUT OF  THE ARABIAN NIGHTS, JUST LIKE THE ONE ALADDIN KEPT HIS GENIE IN! HA HA HA! THINK THAT'S SILLY, ZIPPER? WELL, YOU'LL SEE. I'LL JUST GIVE IT A RUB, AND WE'LL BE UP TO OUR WHISKERS IN WISHES. OH! SOMEONE HAS MY LAMP! OVER THERE. QUICK! WHO HAS SUMMONED THE SPIRIT OF THE LAMP? I COME TO OFFER HIM THREE WISHES. I AWAIT HIS COMMAND. STRIKE ME TILL I'M BLUE IN THE MORNING! I'M RICH! I CAN'T LOSE IT, NOT NOW! WHO HAS MY...AAAH! IT'S THE RESCUE RANGER! CRIKEY! I WISH THE OTHERS COULD SEE THIS. THEY-- GRANTED! OH, NO, NO, NO, NO! -WHAT WAS THAT? -WHAT WAS THAT? ARE YOU OK, MONTEREY? WHAT IS THAT THING? WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE? IT'S A MAGIC LAMP WITH A BLINKING LIVE GENIE IN IT! A MAGIC LAMP? HA HA! THAT'S SILLY. IT'S TRUE! ASK ZIPPER. YEAH. FINALLY! LET ME MAKE A WISH! EASY THERE, PALLY. JUST WAIT YOUR TURN. I'M NOT DONE WITH ME WISHES YET. OKAY. SURE. OUCH! YOU SUMMONED ME, MASTER? TOO RIGHT, I DID. AND NOW I KNOW WHAT I WANT. I WANT...CHEESE! IT SHALL BE DONE. NO, WAIT! I MEAN... LOTS OF CHEESE! BUT OF COURSE! I MEAN A GREAT, HEAPING BONZA PILE OF CHEESE! IS THAT ALL? GRANTED! MONTY, ARE YOU OK? HMM. WHERE'S THE CHEESE? WHAT'S HAPPENING? CH-CH-CHEESE! AH HA HA! -AAH! -AAH! AH HA HA HA! AH HA HA HA! GOLLY! IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF CRACKERS TO GET THROUGH THIS. HEY, YOU GUYS, HELP ME! I'M STUCK IN HERE! HEY, WHERE'S MONTEREY? YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT I COULD NEVER GET ENOUGH CHEESE, AND I HAVEN'T! [CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP] OH BOY, OH BOY. I WONDER IF THE LAMP WORKS WITH PEANUTS? NOW, PALLY, I SAID NOT TO TOUCH MY LAMP UNTIL I'M DONE WITH IT. HAVE IT YOUR WAY, MR. MONTEREY JACK! MAYBE YOUR NEXT WISH OUGHT TO BE FOR SOME NEW FRIENDS! COME ON, GUYS. WHO CARES ABOUT HIS SILLY LAMP ANYWAY? I DO. I DIDN'T MEAN TO... IT'S ONLY THAT... AH, YOU BLINKIN' IDIOT! THIS WISHING BUSINESS HAS GONE TO YOUR HEAD. SPEAKING OF WISHES... WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR YOUR FINAL ONE? FINAL ONE? I JUST STARTED! YOU'VE HAD TWO. I GRANT NO MORE THAN THREE. USUALLY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN "USUALLY"? IT'S BEEN 5,000 YEARS SINCE I HAD A DAY OFF. YEAH? USE YOUR THIRD WISH TO GIVE ME THE WEEKEND OFF, AND I'LL GIVE YOU MORE WISHES THAN YOU IMAGINE... FOREVER! FOREVER! CRIKEY! YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL, MATE. I WISH YOU WAS FREE OF THE LAMP. GRANTED! HO HO HO! I'M FREE! OOH. CAN'T SAY MUCH FOR THE WARDROBE. MONTE: HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON? WHERE AM I? GENIE: JUST A DETAIL I FORGOT TO MENTION. THE ONE WHO WISHES THE GENIE OUTSIDE MUST TAKE HIS PLACE INSIDE. AH, NO! SEE YOU IN 5,000 YEARS, MASTER. HO HO HO HEE HEE HEE! WELL, MONTY, YOU REALLY PUT THE BOTCH ON IT THIS TIME. MAYBE I'LL BE A MITE SMARTER IN 5,000 YEARS. STILL, IF I COULD GET ONE OF ME MATES TO RUB THE LAMP, WHY, I COULD WISH THE GENIE BACK INSIDE HERE IN HALF A BLINK. I JUST HAVE TO GET THEIR ATTENTION! HELLO! HELLO OUT THERE! HEY, I--I HEARD SOMETHING. DO YOU SMELL CHEESE? YES. THE FAT ONE WITH THE LAMP MUST BE CLOSE BY. MOLE: HEY, YOU GUYS, WAIT UP! OOF! WART: GET OUT HERE. HELP US LOOK FOR THE LAMP. AAH! OOH. WHAT LAMP? -OH! -OH! -YOU FOUND IT! -YOU FOUND IT! I--I DID? NOW MAYBE FAT CAT WON'T KILL US. ARE YOU KIDDING? WITH THIS, HE CAN MAKE US ALL RICH! THE GENIE OF THE LAMP WILL BE FAT CAT'S SLAVE! GADGET: GOSH, I CAN'T BELIEVE MONTEREY WOULD JUST DISAPPEAR AND LEAVE ALL THAT CHEESE. HE HAS THE MAGIC LAMP. HE CAN JUST WISH FOR MORE. HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE? GADGET: THAT'S THE GENIE! THE GUY'S A NUT, I TELL YA. HE BUYS A RUG AND THEN WANTS HIS MONEY BACK 'CAUSE IT DON'T FLY. YOU SEE? CONVICTED BY HIS OWN WORDS. HE ADMITS HIS FLYING CARPETS ARE DEFECTIVE. HOW COME THE GENIE IS DRESSED LIKE MONTEREY JACK? AND WHY ISN'T HE IN THE LAMP? LOOK, BUDDY, MOVE ON OR I'LL RUN YOU IN. VERY WELL, BUT YOUR CALIPH WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS. HE'S GOT TO KNOW WHERE MONTY IS. FIVE THOUSAND YEARS LATER AND THEY CAN'T GET A THROW-RUG OFF THE GROUND. HOW CAN THIS CENTURY BE SO BACKWARD? -TIMBER! -TIMBER! WHAT IN THE... OH, IT'S YOU. ALL RIGHT. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MONTEREY JACK? YEAH, HAND HIM OVER. OH, THE ROTUND ONE WITH THE CHEESE OBSESSION. THE, UH... NEW GENIE WOULD KNOW WHERE HE IS. -THE NEW GENIE? -WHERE DO WE FIND HIM? HE'D BE WITH THE LAMP, OF COURSE. AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THAT COULD BE. JUST THINK... A MAGIC LAMP THAT GIVES YOU GOLD, SILVER... DIAMONDS...RUBIES! THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS. WHAT WOULD YOU WISH FOR, MOLE, IF YOU COULD HAVE ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD? UH...A CANDY BAR? A CANDY BAR! HA HA. HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE? THIS GANG DON'T HAVE THE BRAINS OF A MEAT AX. ONE LITTLE RUB WON'T HURT. FAT CAT NEED NOT KNOW. OH, BOY! CANDY! COME ON, LADS, MAKE UP YOUR MINDS! DROP THE LAMP, OR YOU'RE ALL FISH BAIT. IT WAS THAT GREEDY MOLE! HE WANTED THE LAMP! BAD MOLE, BAD! ALL I WANTED WAS A CANDY BAR. THANK GOODNESS I'M HERE TO RESCUE IT FROM YOU PEA-BRAINED, SMALL-TIME THINKERS AND YOUR PUNY LITTLE WISHES. BUT IT WAS GOING TO BE AN EXTRA-LARGE CANDY BAR. I BET MIND READERS ONLY CHARGE YOU HALF PRICE. STAND BACK! I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THIS. COME TO ME, GENIE. WE HAVE HISTORY TO MAKE. [COUGH COUGH] THIS LAMP COULD USE A TUNEUP. NO! IT CAN'T BE!
