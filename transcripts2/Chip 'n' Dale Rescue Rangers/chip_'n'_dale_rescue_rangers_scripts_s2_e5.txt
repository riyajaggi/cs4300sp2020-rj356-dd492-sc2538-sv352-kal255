Come, come, Drake, that's no way to treat an old friend. Hey, what's that? Somebody get in here. (COUGHING) It's... It's gas! CHIP: Klordane must have hidden the glacier underground. (SCREAMING) (THUDDING) GADGET: Why would Klordane need all that ice down here? I guess this old pooch has some spunk left in him yet. Maybe a little too much. KLORDANE: Ah, the Global Gold Reserve. Think of it, Drake. The single largest collection of gold coins and ingots in the world, and soon it will be mine. All mine. Ah, you're out of your mind, Klordane. The Reserve's a fortress. There's no way you'll crack their security. Crack their security? Interesting choice of words because that is exactly what I'm going to do. (COINS RATTLING) Crack their vaults like an eggshell and let the gold spill right into my pockets. No kiddin'. And where are you gonna get an earthquake from, smart guy? (CHUCKLING) I'm going to make one. Right there, directly beneath the Reserve. PERCY: Uh, boss? Yes, Percy, what is it now? Plato! (PANTING) (PLATO YELPING) Wait, Plato. Oh, I missed you, too, partner. Oh, how touching. A dope and his dog. (GROWLING) (EXCLAIMS) Nice doggie. (SNARLING) Is it any wonder that I prefer cats? Wowie! That was a close one. Are you okay, Dale? Oh, yeah. (LAUGHING) Lucky it landed on my head. Hey, everyone, look. Someone took Plato this way. Come on, we gotta get him. -And don't forget the ruby. -CHIP: Right. And teach that fat furball a thing or three about house-wreckin'. Okay, nothing's going to stop us this time, right, everyone? ALL: Right! (ALL GASPING) GADGET: Golly! DALE: What's all this? It's absolutely tremendous. Doesn't matter. We're going in there just like we said. Klordane may have mechanical marvels. He does. He may have fiendish thingies. He does. He does. He may even have hundreds of cutthroat, bloodthirsty thugs. Yup, them, too. But we've got something he doesn't have. GADGET: Enough sense to get out of here? Courage, and our friendship binding us together. So follow me. We've got a date with a ruby. He's bonkus in the conkus, you know. Yeah, but he is my friend. Oh, well, you only live twice. Okay, we've made it this far. Now all we do is climb this laser. -Gadget, you handle the ropes. -Check. Monty, we'll need you to haul us up. Right you are, lad. -And, Dale... -Got it, Chip. I haven't said what yet. (LAUGHS) Oh, yeah. You and I go up there and get the ruby. FAT CAT: And what do I do? You just... ALL: Fat Cat! -In the fur. -CHIP: Scram! Let's not be coy. You know I hate to eat on the run. (LIQUID BUBBLING) (CHIP GASPING) Chip! Oh, drat. (ALL SPUTTERING) Hey, this stuff tastes real good. Uh, sort of limey. Watch who you're callin' names, boyo. It never hurts to be prepared. Yeah. Look out! (ALL SPUTTERING) And when my custom-made earthquake splits the vault floor, all the money will be mine, and no one will know. (LAUGHS) What do you think of that? I think I wanna know what all this green stuff has to do with an earthquake. That green stuff is powdered gelatin. Gelatin? You're ready for the loony bin, Klordane. Do I sense a note of skepticism? Professor Nimnul! Detective Drake doesn't think you can whip up an earthquake for me. Show him the final phase of my master plan. We'll be down below. First, we'll need the proper utensils. Uh-oh. Company. Paddle! We aren't gonna make it, mates. Um, may I suggest something? ALL: Yes! ALL: No! (ALL SCREAMING) (LAUGHS) At least we're safe now. (ALL SCREAMING) Chip! Yuck! (KLORDANE LAUGHING) Beats cooking with a microwave, eh, Drake? Now we chill until set. Don't worry. I'll get us out of this. GADGET: Oops. Here we go again. (ALL SCREAMING) Well, that didn't work. Why didn't it work? It should've worked. Oh, nothing I do works. Does that mean if I did something that shouldn't work, it would work, or does it mean I'm a failure? Tell me, Chip. I can take it. Am I a failure? Um, Gadget, could we talk about this later? (ALL SCREAMING) There. Drake, you wondered how I could crack the Global Gold Reserve? Now you can see for yourself. Wow! Lookie where we are! Uh, that-- that's it? You're gonna start an earthquake with lime gelatin? (LAUGHING) Oh, Klordane, you really had me goin' there. I-- I almost believed you. Wait a minute. Didn't-- Didn't you forget the whipped cream? NIMNUL: Now you stop laughing. My theories are perfectly legitimate. Are you quite done, Detective Drake? (STOPS LAUGHING) Good. Then we may proceed with the demonstration. (DRAKE LAUGHING) W-W-What's going on? He's actually making an earthquake. And we're sitting right on top of it. I don't hear you laughing, Drake. You're mad, Klordane. Mad! No, actually, I'm quite happy. I'm such a genius. Let the earthquake begin! NIMNUL: Now you just wait a minute. You can't hog all the credit for this. I'm the one who built the laser. I'm the one who brought the ice. I'm the one who invented the soon-to-be-world-famous Nimnul Fruitquake. Nimnul Fruitquake? Uh, whatever. Anyway, I did all those things. Therefore, I should be the one who gets to start the earthquake. You know, I believe you're correct, Nimnul. You do deserve the honor of triggering the earthquake. What? No! (ALL SCREAMING) (HORNS BLARING) Golly! Talk about pennies from heaven. Hide! Heads up, Drake, or you'll miss my golden opportunity. (KLORDANE LAUGHING) Wallopin' wombats! It looks like King Midas dropped his piggybank. Wait till I find a gumball machine. Put that back. And that, as they say, is that. All right, boys, start shoveling. (ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) Hey, guys, look, there's Plato. (MUFFLED BARKING) MONTEREY: Crikey! He's locked up tighter than a clam in a nutcracker. (MUFFLED) Can you release my muzzle? -Uh, "can your fleas do my puzzle"? -Oh, quiet. Just help me get this muzzle off. Mmm. Yes, much better. Um, we're sorry, Plato. We let you down. We failed as crime fighters. Yeah, we didn't get the ruby. Forget the ruby, lads. Can't you see what's going on? Klordane has to be stopped. It's up to you five. You must alert the police. Us? Get way up there? In time to rescue the gold? You'll think of a way. I believe in you. PLATO: From here on, the fate of the Global Gold Reserve is in the hands of you tiny troopers, you chipmunk challengers, you... rescue rangers. I like the sound of that, "Rescue Rangers." We'll do it. We'll get those policemen down here lickety-split. Great, but, uh... Uh, how are we gonna do that, Chipper, lad? Simple. We'll start another earthquake. ALL: What? Hurry up, you worthless whiners. The train leaves in two minutes. Are you sure this is a good idea, Chip? CHIP: Just keep running. Uh, looking for this? We weren't thinking of hitting that gelatin again, were we? You mustachioed hairball, I've got a score to settle with you. Settle a score? Yeah, you curtain-clawin' clown! You sunk my house! Oh, dear. I can't tell you how sorry I am. I assure you, if I had it to do over again, I'd set fire to it. Oh, this is too precious. Do you really think you're going to bend those bars? (MONTEREY GRUNTING) It's time you and I had a tango lesson. (CATERWAULING) (SCREAMING) (ALL YELLING) What's going on? This is not part of my master plan. If it's possible, I hate them even more now. (ALL EXCLAIMING) No one stops Aldrin Klordane. Look, Klordane's getting away. Wait for me. I've got the ruby. Oh, Professor, I wouldn't dream of leaving without you. Give me your hand. Bye. (NIMNUL SCREAMING) Plato, give them your siren howl. Oh, of course. (HOWLING) It's a double-cross. Klordane's leaving with the gold. After him. Let's see them follow me now. (KLORDANE LAUGHING) It looks like Klordane will make a clean getaway. Maybe the police can't get through that mess, but we can. Come on. DALE: Klordane's got too much of a lead. Rats! We'll never catch him now. Oh, I don't know, Chip. If you give me a minute, maybe I can rig something. Well, not really a minute, actually, 52 seconds would be enough. (DALE WHOOPING) Thar she blows! Train's late again, Chauncey. Yep, Edgar. (TRAIN HORN BLARING) How come we never get that train? Things could be worse. Great, Gadget, we're almost there. Hit the brakes. Golly, no one said anything about stopping. Y-Y-You mean there's no brakes? Hmm. Oh, I know. Help me turn this blowtorch around. (GRUNTING) It's stuck. (ALL SCREAMING) Hang on. Hang on, chaps. (ALL SCREAMING) You chaps are amazing. I knew you'd get through. Now, can you get me free? Well, we could cut you free in a few minutes. No good. No good. Klordane will be out of the city and scot-free by then. Leave it to us. We'll undo his choo-choo. Rescue Rangers, away! You know, little gem, I never had a train or a coin collection as a child, but I guess this makes up for it. (LAUGHING) Ow! What? (BOTH GIGGLING) Chipmunks? Chipmunks? I can't believe that for once, Percy and Nimnul were right. Well, I'll soon fix you. (GROANING) Thanks, Gadget. Now, can you stop the train? I'll certainly give it my best effort, Chip. Come on, come on. (GRUNTING) Chip, I'm gonna need some... Help! Wave bye-bye. (SCREAMING) (SQUEAKING) Yay, Monterey! Simple case of a coal in one. (LAUGHS) Great going, Monty. But we've still got to stop this train. Don't worry, mates. I'll give you a hand. Yikes! I will not allow my plans to be destroyed by some household pests. (SQUEAKING) (EXCLAIMS) (GROWLING) Get away from that throttle. (HORN BLARING) Gee, Chip, we'll never stop the train now. Then we'll just have to re-route it. Grab a helmet, partner. Ready or not, here I come. Alley-oop. (BELL CLANGING) This is the wrong way. What? It's those chipmunks again. They've ruined everything. Everything! But I'll get them. You blasted pests, I'll pulverize you. (PLATO HOWLING) Drake's dog! No! (SNARLING) (KLORDANE SCREAMING) No! (ALL SCREAMING) (GROWLING) No! Here, here, I confess. I stole the ruby. I robbed the bank, not Drake. No, no, no. Now, please, pry this dog off of me. (PANTING) Good dog, Plato. (ALL CHEERING) Well, Plato, looks like we can finally retire that famous Crime Bite of yours, huh? (DRAKE LAUGHING) Of course, now that you've earned your own police badge, maybe you'll wanna stay on without me. (CHUCKLING) I'm just kiddin', partner. Now, wait here. I gotta say goodbye to some folks. Wowzers! What a neat badge. Yeah, what an honor. Oh, yes, quite an honor. (CLEARING THROAT) An officer's badge is the symbol of his or her promise to protect the innocent and help those in need. It is a mark of courage and resourcefulness in the face of danger. That's why I'm giving it to you, lads. BOTH: Huh? He's right, mates. Congratulations, guys! Gosh, thanks. (SNIFFLING) Yeah, well, it was a grand adventure, but I guess Zipper and I'd best be shovin' off. There's a cheese ship leavin' on the tide. Leaving? But, Monterey... Golly, and I guess I'd better get back to my workshop. But we were hoping... -Uh... -Yeah. We... Uh... But you can't... GIRL: But my puppy is gone, and there's just a big hole where his doghouse was. Oh, well, that sounds pretty mysterious all right, (STAMMERING) but I'm afraid that lost puppies just aren't in our jurisdiction. Then who can I go to for help? I think you lads have another case. You know, Dale, Plato's right, but we're gonna need some help. Yeah, but who? Well, I don't have to get home right away. Oh, I can catch another boat later. Now, let's help that little sheila. Right. Well, I guess there's only one thing to say, then. Rescue Rangers, away!
