 ♪ CH-CH-CH-CHIP 'N' DALE ♪ ♪ WHEN THERE'S DANGER ♪ ♪ CH-CH-CH-CHIP 'N' DALE ♪ CAREFUL, MEN. THAT'S FAR ENOUGH. I WAS RIGHT. IT'S DEFINITELY THE THIGHBONE OF A GIANT SMELLASAURUS. NOBODY MOVE. THE SLIGHTEST DISTURBANCE COULD SHATTER THIS SPECIMEN. OK, WHO DID THAT? WE MUST'VE HIT AN UNDERGROUND POCKET OF GAS. IT'S A DINOSAUR EGG! IT MUST'VE BEEN UNCOVERED BY THE EXPLOSION. THIS COULD BE THE GREATEST FIND IN HISTORY! WE MUST GET THIS BACK TO THE MUSEUM AT ONCE! CAREFUL WITH THAT EGG, MEN. IT'S MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD. I CAN'T WAIT TO WRITE A 50-PAGE RESEARCH PAPER ABOUT IT. LOOK WHAT FOLLOWED ME HOME. I TRIED TO MAKE HIM GO AWAY, BUT HE JUST INSISTED ON COMING WITH ME. OH, NO! NOT ANOTHER ONE. ISN'T HE CUTE? [ARF ARF] YOU'VE GOTTA STOP BRINGING ANIMALS HOME ALL THE TIME. WE DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR-- AWW, HE LIKES YOU. CAN I KEEP HIM? HE WOULDN'T BE ANY TROUBLE. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE FROG THAT TRIED TO EAT ZIPPER. AND THE BABY KITTEN THAT USED ME FOR A SCRATCHING POST. I CAN'T HELP IT THAT ANIMALS LIKE ME. LIKE THE GOLDFISH YOU SAID THAT FOLLOWED YOU HOME? A PET IS A BIG RESPONSIBILITY, DALE. ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S BIGGER THAN YOU ARE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY. AND I'LL SEE TO IT THAT HE NEVER MAKES A MESS. WELL, ALMOST NEVER. DALE, THIS PUPPY HAS A COLLAR WITH A TAG ON IT. HE MUST BELONG TO SOME LITTLE BOY OR GIRL. YOU TAKE HIM BACK WHERE YOU FOUND HIM, RIGHT AWAY. AW. [SPEAKING DINOSAUR] YIKES! [SPEAKING DINOSAUR] DROP IT RIGHT NOW. OH, BOY! A LIZARD! I BET THAT YOU'D REALLY LIKE TO STAY WITH ME, WOULDN'T YA? [GIRL] RUFFLES! HERE, RUFFLES! RUFFLES! YOU'RE BACK! I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. IT MUST BE GREAT TO HAVE A PET. HEY, WHY DON'T YOU-- COME BACK, YOU LIZARD! I WANT YOU FOR MY SCIENCE PROJECT. UH-OH. THIS WAY, PAL. YOU'RE TRAPPED NOW. OW! MAMA! [CRIES] I GUESS HE WANTED YOU FOR A PET. SAY, YOU'D MAKE A GREAT-- NO. THEY'D NEVER LET ME KEEP YOU. YOU BETTER GO HOME NOW, OK? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GO HOME. SHOO! GOSH, HE'S CUTE. READ MY LIPS. GO HOME! I GUESS I'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN. AAH! LOOKS LIKE THE COAST IS CLEAR. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HIDE YOU IN MY ROOM. COME ON, DALE, SHAKE YOUR TAIL! WE'VE GOT A MISSION. YOU'D BETTER GO WITHOUT ME. YOU ALREADY MISSED BREAKFAST. ARE YOU OK? I DON'T FEEL GOOD. I'LL PROBABLY BE OK AFTER YOU'RE GONE-- I MEAN, BY THE TIME WHEN YOU GET BACK. WELL, ALL RIGHT, IF YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE OK. I HOPE I'M NOT COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING TOO. YIPPEE! NOW I CAN PLAY WITH MY NEW PET. WHEN I SAY "ROLL OVER," YOU ROLL OVER. THAT'S GREAT. NOW, TRY IT AGAIN. ROLL OVER. COME ON. ROLL OVER. ROLL OVER. ROLL OVER. ROLL-- [CRASH] THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. I'LL TEACH YOU TO FETCH A STICK. NOW, FETCH. NOW YOU TRY IT. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE. I BET YOU'RE HUNGRY. WAIT HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT LIZARDS EAT, SO I BROUGHT A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING. GOSH, YOU ARE HUNGRY. I'D BETTER GET SOME MORE FOOD. THIS IS THE LAST OF THE-- WHOA! OH, NO! YOU GOT BIG! [CHIP] PHEW! WHAT A MISSION. UH-OH. THEY'RE BACK. REMEMBER THAT TRICK I TAUGHT YOU? FREEZE! I DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE RANGER PLANE. DALE! SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN BED? I SLEPT OUT HERE ON THE SOFA. 40 WINKS SOUNDS LIKE JUST THE TICKET. WHOA. YEAH. IT'S A BIT LUMPY. AHH. WE HAD TERRIBLE PROBLEMS WITH THE RANGER PLANE ON THE WAY BACK. YEAH, A FAULTY WING FLAP WAS CAUSING IT TO ROLL OVER. DON'T SAY THAT. DON'T SAY WHAT? ROLL OVER. AAH! AH! AH! IT'S A DINOSAUR! NO, IT'S NOT! IT'S MY PET LIZARD. YOU DUMMY. IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PICTURE OF THE DINOSAUR IN YOUR COMIC BOOK. HE'S TOO SMALL TO BE A DINOSAUR. MAYBE HE'S A BABY DINOSAUR. IN ANY CASE, WE'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT WHERE HE CAME FROM. CAN I KEEP HIM AS A PET UNTIL THEN? I SUPPOSE SO. OH BOY! I'M GONNA NAME HIM STEGGY. BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM. I WILL! I'LL FEED HIM, TEACH HIM TRICKS-- BUT ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS WATCH TV AND LOOK AT COMIC BOOKS. SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFECT PET FOR YOU. THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY! THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY DINOSAURS FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS. OH YEAH? THEN WHAT DID HE DO? DROP OUT OF THE SKY? WE INTERRUPT THIS SECOND-RATE MONSTER MOVIE FOR A NEWS BULLETIN. SCIENTISTS AT THE CITY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY TODAY REPORTED A DRAMATIC DISCOVERY-- A DINOSAUR EGG IN PERFECT CONDITION. -WAIT! -COME BACK! YUCK! OH, NO! DON'T WORRY, MATES. I'LL SAVE HIM. OK, START WORRYING. COME ON. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? RIGHT AS RAIN, GADGET LOVE, AND TWICE AS WET. I WONDER WHY HE RAN OFF LIKE THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE. I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE'S GONNA HAVE TO LEARN TO BE CAREFUL. YEAH, HE COULD GET HURT. LOOK OUT! WOW! WE COULD HAVE BEEN FLATTENED. NO KIDDING! IT'S A GOOD THING THAT-- [RANGERS] HE TALKED! YES, I'VE LEARNED YOUR LANGUAGE BY STUDYING YOUR EARTH LITERATURE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "EARTH LITERATURE"? HE MEANS MY COMIC BOOKS. ZOWIE! THEN YOU'RE NOT REALLY A DINOSAUR AT ALL. I AM A DINOSAUR, BUT I COME FROM ANOTHER PLANET IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY. WE HAVE LIVED THERE HAPPILY FOR MILLIONS OF CENTURIES. HIDDEN IN THE CLEARINGS OF OUR SWAMP-LIKE ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE BUILT CITIES TO HOUSE OUR POPULATION, WHERE WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE TOGETHER IN PERFECT HARMONY. THERE HAVE BEEN NO WARS, NO FIGHTING ON OUR PLANET FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. FOR WE HAVE LEARNED TO BE CONTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE. AND THROUGH THE YEARS, OUR ARTISTS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR BUSY SOCIETY, MAKING OUR LIVES MEANINGFUL AND COMPLETE. WE HAVE EVEN STUDIED THE STARS OF THE SKY AND DEVELOPED OUR OWN SPACE PROGRAM TO EXPLORE THE PLANETS OF THE GALAXIES AROUND US. ONE PLANET IN PARTICULAR HAD THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR LIFE FORMS-- THE PLANET YOU CALL EARTH. MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO, WE LAUNCHED A FLEET OF SPACECRAFTS TO TRAVEL TO THIS PLANET. WE MAINTAINED RADIO CONTACT WITH THEM UNTIL SOON AFTER THEY LANDED HERE. THEN, WITHOUT WARNING, ALL COMMUNICATIONS CEASED. WITH THE FAILURE OF OUR SPACE PROGRAM, WE WERE TOO FEARFUL TO CONTINUE EXPLORING THE PLANETS AND ABANDONED FUTURE SPACE RESEARCH. BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO FIND OUR WHAT HAPPENED TO MY ANCESTORS. SO, OUTFITTING OUR LAST SPACESHIP WITH A LARGE SUPPLY OF FOOD PACKETS, I TRAVELED ACROSS THE UNIVERSE TO SEE FOR MYSELF. MEANWHILE, AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, MY SPACESHIP HAS BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A DINOSAUR EGG. THE DINOSAUR EGG THEY FOUND IS A SPACESHIP? ZOWIE! JUST A FEW MORE ADJUSTMENTS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME FROM THAT EVIL VILLAIN WHO TRIED TO CAPTURE ME. THAT'S WHAT RESCUE RANGERS ARE FOR. BESIDES, NOW THAT WE'RE FRIENDS, WE CAN PLAY A WHOLE LOT OF NEAT GAMES. PERHAPS. I'M AFRAID YOUR GAMES OF FETCH AND ROLL OVER ARE A BIT TOO SIMPLE FOR ME. THE RANGER PLANE IS READY TO FLY. GREAT. WHERE DO I SIT? I SEEM TO BE GAINING SOME UNWANTED POUNDS. IMAGINE HOW BIG YOU'LL BE WHEN YOU'RE FULL-GROWN DINOSAUR. BUT I WAS ALREADY FULL-GROWN WHEN I LEFT MY PLANET. [ALL] WHAT? AAH! YEOW! YIKES! SORRY ABOUT THAT LANDING. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M STARTING TO GET USED TO IT. OW! ANYBODY SEEN STEGGY? IT MUST'VE ESCAPED FROM THE REPTILE EXHIBIT. THIS WAY, MEN. THEY MUST BE AFTER STEGGY! WE'VE GOTTA FIND HIM FIRST. RIGHTO, MATE. BUT WHERE? ZOWIE. SO THIS IS WHAT YOU TURNED INTO. STEGGY! WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE! I FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LAST COLONY. SOMETHING HERE ON THE EARTH MADE THEM GROW TO GIANT SIZE. AS THEIR BODIES GREW BIG, THEIR BRAINS GREW SMALL. THEY GOT, UM... WHAT DID THEY GET? DUMB? YEAH, THAT'S IT. DUMB. AS THEY GOT BIGGER, THEY GOT... WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN? GOSH. STEGGY'S BRAIN MUST BE GETTING SMALLER. FIRST THEY GOT DUMBER, THEN THEY GOT-- NO, WAIT. FIRST, BIGGER, THEN-- NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. YOU'D BETTER STAY HERE WITH DALE, STEGGY, WHILE WE TRY TO FIND YOUR SPACESHIP. RIGHT. I'LL STAY HERE WITH-- WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN? I SWEAR, DR. PILDOWN, IT WAS A BIG LIZARD, LIKE A BABY DINOSAUR. WELL, IF THIS IS A JOKE, I'LL HAVE YOU PUT IN CHARGE OF THE CHILDREN'S GROUP TOURS. ANYTHING BUT THAT, DOC. IF YOU FIND ANYTHING, I'LL BE IN MY LAB. ALL RIGHT, STEGGY. ROLL OVER. GOSH! YOU CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING EXCEPT THE TRICKS I TAUGHT YOU. YOU USED TO THINK THOSE GAMES WERE TOO SIMPLE. OH, ALL RIGHT, STEGGY. FETCH. NO, STEGGY, DON'T FETCH! HUH? WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE FAST! SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE HEARD THOSE BONES FALLING. OH, NO! WAIT TILL DOC PILDOWN GETS A LOAD OF THIS. HE WON'T GET AWAY THIS TIME. I'D BETTER GET HELP. KEEP AN EYE ON HIM TILL I GET BACK WITH DR. PILDOWN. IF YOU WERE A SPACESHIP, WHERE WOULD YOU BE? OUTER SPACE? SOMEBODY'S COMING. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S IN THAT EGG. [GUARD] WILL DR. PILDOWN PLEASE COME TO THE DINOSAUR ROOM? THIS HAD BETTER BE IMPORTANT. COME ON, ZIPPER. LET'S GO! NOW THAT WE'RE UP HERE, HOW DO WE GET INSIDE? SHH. HMM. IT'S NO USE, MATES. WE'RE SURE TO MAKE NOISE BREAKING INSIDE THIS BABY. AAH! GOOD WORK, MONTY. WOW! ALL THIS INSIDE AN LITTLE, OLD EGG. I'LL BET THIS IS EASY TO FLY. -AAH! -AAH! I CAN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE. I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO SAVE STEGGY ON MY OWN. AFTER ALL, HE IS MY RESPONSIBILITY. IF YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS WILL MAKE ANOTHER TERRIFIC RESEARCH PAPER. I SWEAR, DOC, WE'VE CAUGHT IT THIS TIME. AND IT'S EVEN BIGGER THAN I REMEMBERED. OH, NO! [BURP] STEGGY! REMEMBER THE TRICKS I TAUGHT YOU? FREEZE! A STEGOSAURUS HAS A BRAIN THE SIZE OF A WALNUT. YOU SHOULD BE SO LUCKY. YOU'VE ROPED ONE OF OUR DINOSAUR MODELS! YOU SEE? NOTHING BUT PLASTER. WE'LL GET HIM, DOC! ROLL OVER, STEGGY! THIS IS INCREDIBLE! JUMP, STEGGY! I'VE GOT IT! I'VE GOT IT! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MONTY? NEVER BETTER. BEEN TALLER, HOWEVER. WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE! [DR. PILDOWN] THE CREATURE'S IN MY LAB! THERE'S A BUNCH OF GUYS CHASING US! DON'T YOU EVER STOP EATING, STEGGY? HE'S PROBABLY MISSED HAVING FOOD FROM HIS OWN PLANET. HEY! THE GROWTH PROCESS IS REVERSING. YEAH, AND HE'S GETTING SMALLER. IT MUST BE THE FOOD FROM MY OWN PLANET THAT KEEPS ME SMALL. HEY, YOU'RE GETTING SMARTER, TOO. HE WON'T GET AWAY THIS TIME, MEN. AAH! THAT'S IT, STEGGY, SHOW THEM HOW A DINOSAUR FLIES. I DON'T THINK I'LL WRITE THAT RESEARCH PAPER AFTER ALL. WELL, IT'S 83 KAZILLION MILES BACK TO MY PLANET. I'D BETTER GET MOVING BEFORE RUSH HOUR. MY PEOPLE WILL BE INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WITH THEIR ANCESTORS. OHH. -OH, UH, DALE? -YEAH? I'D LIKE IT VERY MUCH IF YOU'D COME AND LIVE WITH ME ON MY PLANET. OH YEAH? BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY PETS. [LAUGHTER] WELL, MAYBE HE COULDN'T HANDLE THE RESPONSIBILITY.
