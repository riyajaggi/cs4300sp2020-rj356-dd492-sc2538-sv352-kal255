 A History of Ancient Britain (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - Age of Ancestors - full transcript 
 In the last 10,000 years, after the Ice Age, the rising sea turned the British regions into islands, largely covered with woods. Only some thousands Mesolithic hunters-gatherers roamed around. However, apparently in several waves and at several coasts, neolithic people invaded, importing sedentary life. The superior productivity of agriculture and other technology, as i tool-making, enabled the start of many aspects of civilization, such as ownership, socio-political structures and armed violence. They left the first monuments, still hard to read.

 Ripped By mstoll This is the story of how Britain came to be, of how our land and its people were forged over thousands of years of ancient history. This Britain is a strange and alien world, a world that contains the hidden story of our distant, prehistoric past. The occupation of Britain began with hunters battling for survival through the Ice Age. It's fantastic, after 14,000 years, to get a glimpse of the way at least one individual was thinking. And continued into a new age that came after the ice.

 Instead of hunting mammoth and reindeer in the snow, he hunted red deer in the wild wood. Now, the journey continues, with the next chapter in our epic story. Nothing like this had ever been seen before in Britain. The invention of farming, and the massive social revolution that came with it. A brave, new world that shaped our land and the way we lived, forever. I'm going back 10,000 years to a wild and untamed Britain. The Ice Age was over and a new Britain had emerged, blanketed with trees. Birch, alder, hazel and, finally, oak. Across the whole of our land, perhaps no more than a few thousand nomadic hunters lived

 by drawing everything they needed from that landscape. They had flint for tools, red deer provided meat, antler for picks and harpoons and needles, hides for shelters and clothes. These people didn't just live close to nature, they were part of nature. Ten thousand years ago, Britain was still attached to mainland Europe as it had been throughout the Ice Age. Now, though, sea levels were rising and a new Britain was emerging. Gradually, Britain was becoming an island. Much of the land that had been home to nomadic hunters for thousands of years was disappearing beneath the waves. Here on the south coast, just off the Isle of Wight, is a relic of the ancient world, evidence of people who lived here just as all this was becoming sea. Ten thousand years ago, there was no Isle of Wight. It was part of the English mainland to the north, and still joined to northern Europe and France to the south. And all of that out there, The Solent, was dry land. Which should mean, out there, underneath the water are the relics of a lost world, and of the people who lived on it. It's a world that's being explored by archaeologist Garry Momber, and I'm going to join him. I'm about to go back to a time when rising sea levels were turning land into tidal marsh, when Britain was an island in the making. The site is 8,000 years old, a time archaeologists call the Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age. It's really opening a picture of Mesolithic Period that we're not getting from sites on land. So, when the sea level's lower further back in time, and we're finding the well-preserved remains. So, it's actually the sea that's going to make it awkward for us, is what has preserved what we're gonna see. If it wasn't for the sea, uh, it wouldn't be there. We're doing a final diver check! Everything okay? Divers ready for the water. Once, this was home to a coastal community of hunter-gatherers, living a way of life that had barely changed for thousands of years. What's been discovered here is more than an ancient hunting camp. It's the oldest boat-building yard in the world. And it contains fragile evidence of the sophistication of the people who once lived here. - That was fantastic! - It was. I can stay down there for hours when it's like that. So, this piece of timber is how old? I mean, since it was worked. It's over 8,000 years old. It's come up in association with other bits and pieces, and one piece of timber in particular, which we believe, may be part of a log boat. - See those grooves? Uh-huh. How clearly defined they are? So, that's wood-working, that's not natural erosion? No, that's wood-working. That's obviously part of something, with the grooves either side. - Someone, 8,000 years ago... - We'll get more evidence. Was working with a stone tool to create these grooves. As a general rule, you just don't see organic material coming out of Mesolithic sites. You get the stone tools but to see what those stone tools were being used for, it's the other half of the equation. It's pretty unique and very special. The log boat is an extraordinary insight into the lives of the hunters who once lived here. Mesolithic life might have been nomadic, but it was largely carried out around the shore lines of Britain's coasts and rivers. The forested land of the interior was a dangerous, forbidding world. But all that was about to change. And all because of these tiny grains of barley. Like The Solent boat builders, these are around 8,000 years old. But these aren't from the Isle of Wight. These are from more than 2,000 miles away to the southeast, what's now Syria. This is evidence of a new way of living. A world not of hunting, but of farming. When this technology arrived in Britain, it would nudge us towards a whole new era in our history, what we call the Neolithic, the New Stone Age. By producing food, farming communities could provide for bigger families, more children. And that meant better chances of survival for the whole group. Instead of hunting the wild herds, now, farmers had new, domesticated breeds of cattle and sheep. Instead of gathering wild nuts and berries, farmers could grow most of what they needed from seed. The Neolithic revolution was to utterly change the way we thought about food and survival but it was much, much more than that. It was also to profoundly alter our sense of ourselves as human beings, as part of the natural world. In a sense, as well as domesticating livestock we were also domesticating ourselves. This revolution, when it finally reached our shores, would change everything. It would change the land, the things we ate, it would change our relationship with time. It would change our beliefs, and the way we understand our place in the universe. This change, the jump to farming, was the single greatest social revolution there's ever been. To try and understand what happened when the radical, new world of agriculture collided with the ancient world of the hunter, I'm leaving England behind, and crossing the Channel to France. By 5,000 BC, Neolithic culture was spreading into western Europe. For the hunting communities of northern France, the new ways must have been completely baffling. In Brittany, there's a unique set of monuments, line upon line of ancient standing stones. These weren't erected by Neolithic farmers, but by Mesolithic hunters, just as the first farmers started appearing on their doorstep. This place is just extraordinary. I've known about it for years, I've seen photographs of it countless times, but this is my first visit, and the impact of the stones is just breathtaking. Everywhere you look, there's more of them. They're in every direction, line after line of them. And you look at any one of them, they weigh at least tens of tons. Some of them look as if they weigh even more! They completely dominate the landscape everywhere you look. We use "extraordinary" to describe a lot of things but a place like this really deserves the word. What we're looking at is the result of a collision, not just of cultures, but of two completely different belief systems. All of this might be the result of a monumental tipping point in human history. The hunters hauled the stones into place to demonstrate their strength in the face of people they didn't understand. But theirs was the old world. In just a few hundred years, Neolithic culture took over, and many of these great standing stones became building material for something new, Neolithic stone tombs. Archaeologist Serge Cassen has studied them for over 20 years. Is there a connection between the change from lines of stones to tombs like this, and the change to farming? Yes, it is probably linked with this new process, this new economy, this full Neolithic, where life of animals, life of plants are very important inside this life cycle. Inside one tomb, excavated by Serge, this decisive fork in history is marked by some remarkable rock art. So, these... These are the old-style, Mesolithic hunting weapons? Almost like a primitive boomerang... - Yes. - To kill birds. - Exactly. - Okay. So, this is the old world. Very male, very phallic. Yes, exactly. One carving in particular brings it all home. We can observe, now, carvings. - So it's another throwing stick. - Yes, the same shape, the same weapon, the same representation and under, we have the Polish axe from the Neolithic period with this handle. - So, this triangular shape... - Yes. - That's the Neolithic axe. - Exactly, exactly. So, you've got the new technology of the axe... Mmm-hmm. On top of, and even cutting into the old world of the throw stick. Yes. Yes. So, this is almost the moment... Or it's depicting the moment when the old world and the new world collide, and, after that collision, the new world is dominant over the old. Exactly. We may never fully understand a site like Carnac. We might never hear what those hunters were trying to say with the stones. But to me, apart from anything else, they are a statement of defiance. They're saying to the farmers, "Come in. Bring your crops, bring your animals "but be aware that we are here. That we've always been here. "We're part of this landscape and we belong to it." They're saying, "We may not last forever, "our way of life may not last forever, "but we will be remembered. Not just for now but for all time." The age of the Mesolithic was coming to an end. By 4,500 BC, the Neolithic revolution had conquered almost all of Europe, but, around here, it came to a halt because of that. Farming might have swept across the land mass of Europe, but the last few watery miles presented a different challenge. It would take hundreds of years, but that final leap across the Channel and into Britain was inevitable. Exactly how the New Stone Age came to Britain, and what the local hunters made of it, remains one of the greatest mysteries in all of our prehistory. The first farmers must have come to Britain by boat, bringing their families, domestic cattle and grain. These were pioneers undertaking a perilous journey to a new and unknown land. And direct evidence of some of those first farmers can be found here in Kent. Wait till you see what's up here. Nothing like this had ever been seen before in Britain. This is one of the very earliest stone tombs. This is Neolithic behaviour. The people who built this were amongst the first to come and farm our land. And we're talking about 6,000 years ago. Today, the rich soil of Kent is still prime farming land. And, together with its proximity to mainland Europe, you can see the attraction for the earliest farmers coming over. Of course, you have to remember that 6,000 years ago, when the first people arrived with the intention of farming here, all of that would have been woodland. So, first of all, they had to clear the trees. Cut them down, burn them down, and then they had to build their homesteads. I can only imagine what the local hunters thought. Unlike the Mesolithic hunters, who hugged the coast line and river valleys, the first farmers began to break into the interior of Britain, and what they found was a wild and wooded place. For thousands of years, forests of oak and birch had grown, blanketing the landscape in green. This was home to red deer and elk, in the undergrowth, bears and wild pig. But this wild and ancient Britain was about to be transformed, forever. The new farmers were technologists. This wasn't living off the land, like the Mesolithic hunters, but shaping it, adapting it, making it work for them. These people weren't simply fitting into the world alongside nature, they were going to rule over it. Incredibly, some of those pioneers, the very mothers and fathers of this brave new world, have survived. Around 17 individuals were interred in that Neolithic tomb in Kent, and these are the bones of just a few of them. There's a whole age range represented amongst the dead. These pelvis bones here, this is a baby, and an older child, through to older people. And old people in Neolithic times is somebody my age. Somebody in their 40s would be pensionable. And we often talk about the Neolithic revolution, and the farming revolution and the effect it had on Britain and on the landscape. But what you also see here, and you have to remember all the time, are real people. This is part of a man's skull. These individuals are part of the most profoundly affecting living experiment that's ever been attempted. They trust their future to planting a few seeds in the spring in the hope of a harvest, in the autumn. They keep some animals in the hope that that meat will be enough to sustain them and their families. It's a gamble. So, whatever else you might want to imagine about this man, he was certainly brave. It's traditionally been thought that farming gradually spread north and west, from its first foothold in the southeast. But new evidence suggests this could be wrong. This is a piece of a bone from a domesticated cow. A classic Neolithic indicator. What makes this one unique, however, is that it wasn't found in the southeast of England, but in the deep southwest of Ireland, and it may date from as early as 4,300 years BC. That's hundreds of years before the first trace of the Neolithic lifestyle in Kent. And, so far, no one has been able to explain what it's doing there. And the unexplained cow bone isn't the only evidence that's challenging the accepted story of how Neolithic culture spread through Britain. As far north as Orkney, there's also evidence of early farmers, in the shape of prehistoric voles. So, here's a group of skulls. You can see characteristic skull shapes. This guy here is the field vole. This is the vole that's found most commonly in the UK mainland. This guy here is actually much more interesting. This is the vole that's found in Orkney but is not found, importantly, in the UK and Ireland. Microtus arvalis, the Orkney vole, only lives on a few islands off the north-east tip of Scotland. The evidence of ancient vole bones shows that they first appeared at least five and a half thousand years ago. The question is, "How did they arrive?" The closest relatives that we have, genetically, to the Orkney vole population are from the Rhine Valley in Germany, and maybe, uh, in Brittany. It's clear the voles aren't swimming from Europe to Orkney on their own, which means that humans are involved. It's thought the voles came amongst grain carried by early farmers. Not from the British mainland, but direct from France. It seems that the early settlers in Kent might represent only one route Neolithic culture took from Europe. There are also those earlier Neolithic expeditions to south-west Ireland, and the mysterious vole-carrying voyages direct to Orkney. What's emerging is something much more complex and subtle than the traditional view of the Neolithic revolution. Many people would have continued with a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle supported by a few domesticated animals. And that way of life would have continued for hundreds of years at least. And then, there were the settled farmers themselves. They would have continued to hunt to supplement their diet. However people took up the new ways, it's now thought that Neolithic culture, in some form, swept across the whole of Britain in just a few generations. But, with just a few fragments of evidence from 6,000 years ago, exactly how it all began might forever remain a mystery. What's more, across the whole of Britain, there's precious little evidence of how those early farmers actually lived. Which is why I'm leaving our shores yet again, headed this time for Ireland. Welcome to the west of Ireland, one of the wildest, most spectacular landscapes I've ever seen. In Britain, archaeologists have only discovered fragments of early farming. But here, something's been preserved on a truly massive scale. What's special about this place is the ground. This landscape is blanketed in peat bog, slowly-decaying vegetation that builds up layer upon layer. It takes thousands of years. But what's drawn me here isn't the bog itself, but what's hidden beneath it, as much as four metres beneath my feet. You just drive it in. Oh, it's like a knife through butter. Archaeologist Seamus Caulfield has been probing this bog with simple metal rods for over 40 years. Just about here and put it in straight. Vertical. Yeah. He's using them to mark ancient stone walls made by the Neolithic farmers who once lived here. So that's the old ground surface coming on and then... - Starting to come up a little bit... - And you're hitting stone and you can hear that you're hitting stone now. - Yeah. - Yes, it's beginning to look like it. - That's amazing. - Listen to that again. Give it... Yeah. Knock, knock. Yes. Five and a half thousand years ago, someone lifted the stone in place and now we're hearing it for the first time. So, how much have you found? How extensive is the wall? Something over 100 linear kilometres, at this stage. A hundred kilometres? - Yeah, yeah. - You're joking. That is... That is jaw dropping. The scale of that. - Five and a half thousand years ago. - The scale of it is, yes. It's just sitting there under the bog, as it was. By probing every inch of this land, Seamus and his teams of helpers have revealed far more than some buried walls. What they've found is the biggest Neolithic field system in the entire world. Cattle enclosures that stretch almost as far as the eye can see. What are the fields for? It's a dairying economy. They have to wean the calves from the milk cows. They have to separate the dry stock from the milking animals. Uh, there's... Herd management is what's involved in these... So, they need lots of separate areas to keep bull calves and milking cows, - and all the rest of them. - Yes. Typically in Ireland, the weather turns foul. But I'm determined to uncover some of this wall for myself. And here on the bog, there is only one way to do it Clean the blade. Is this all just used locally, Seamus? - Is this just for folk to burn and... - Yeah. That's 90% water at the moment, but it dries out, and that's the fuel we use all the time. - So it's all for fuel? - Yeah. All I can say is, "Don't give up the day job." You're right! And look, there it is. Look at that! That is the wall. That's amazing. Look, come here. Look at this. Look. That's the top of a wall that's about a metre high, extends down about a metre beneath my feet. Now, the sun has risen and set two million times since these stones last saw the light of day. The last hands to touch these before mine, were those of a Neolithic farmer five and a half thousand years ago. Now, even on a foul day like today, and this is truly foul, the sight of these, the touch of these, makes it worthwhile. - Doesn't it? Just about. - It does. It does. Yes, it still does. Amazing. The C?ide Fields structures are a hidden wonder of the world. But the walls aren't the only secret. Because the peat itself can reveal just what this world was like five and a half thousand years ago. And even what was being farmed. - I think you've got the top of the bog. - Yeah. The peat is preserving the record of human activity, vegetation, et cetera, through time. So, it is this... It is like a history book of thousands of years. By studying pollen grains preserved in the peat, Michael O'Connell can identify what was growing in the ancient landscape. This particular pollen grain comes from pine and pine was the dominant tree in the C?ide Fields before farmers came. At the early part of the Neolithic, the pollen totally changed from being tree-pollen dominated to being herb and grass dominated. The change to grassland pollen shows that the trees were cut down and replaced with pasture for grazing cattle. But in amongst the grassland pollen, Michael has made an even more startling discovery. We were really excited about these results. This particular sample has quite a number of cereal pollen, and, of course, this is really important because it shows wheat and maybe also barley were grown. So, this was a really interesting and significant find. Cereals and domestic animals transformed society. But there was also a third Neolithic invention, pottery. Together, all three created a completely new diet. A feature of Neolithic life studied by Jacqui Wood. This is actually just wheat. - It's just boiled. - All right. Another new thing for the Neolithic. - Some bread. - A flat bread. - It's just about right. - It's very... That's so flavoursome. Now, this is a bit of prehistoric stew. So it's slow cooking is Neolithic. Slow cooking, yeah, absolutely. Butter was a big thing in the Neolithic. Bread and butter. What could be more quintessentially British? I'll tell you what. Absolutely everything is so substantial. You wouldn't need much of anything, would you, really? No. Sticks to your ribs and everything else. The new food might have seemed good, but human remains show evidence of farmers being less healthy than hunters with their diet of fresh fish and red deer. No more, I beg of you. And there was another price to pay. - This is actually a real quern. - Mmm-hmm. A Neolithic quern. So, this is the genuine article, not a... This is the genuine article. So, if you put some grain on first. - So, this is some 1,000 years old. - That's right. So, what's the action? Just... Spread, up and down like that. But that sound is the sound of the Stone Age, basically. I'm doing this for a minute. But you were put to work like this, you know, on a daily basis, what kind of physical toll do you think this kind of work had on people? We can actually see that it did have a toll because in the archaeology, they actually find some skeletons where the actual parts of the vertebrae are actually quite worn because of repeatedly doing this, grinding. But you need to grind for a good hour every day to make enough bread for a family. Every day. - The daily grind, basically. - The daily grind. Despite all the individual hardships it brought, it was the sheer productivity of farming that made it irresistible as a survival strategy. This is where our working lives began, invented by the first farmers of the Neolithic. This was a point of no return. Farming was productive. So, people could have more children and open up more land. The population increased. There quickly came a day when they couldn't go back to hunting even if they wanted to, because there were simply too many people around. And it wasn't just the daily grind. This new age would usher in the idea of land ownership and conflict. The Neolithic would completely change how we thought about ourselves in this life, and the next The Neolithic revolution changed our mind set. Not only towards work, but the idea of the land and our relationship to it It changed our beliefs. And evidence of these new beliefs can be found in massive stone tombs, some of which mark our countryside even today. One of the most impressive is in Wiltshire. This great, long mound was created by digging thousands of tons of chalk rubble from ditches on either side. Some of the stones weigh 40 tons, and they were hauled here from as much as a mile away. This is the work of a whole community, not just one family, and its people for whom the creation of this mattered as much or more than anything else they were doing. And these were busy farmers. This isn't just a tomb. This isn't simply about remembering a loved one. This is about creating an entire world, one built by the community of the living for the community of the dead. And wait till you see what's inside. About 40 people were buried in here around 3,600 BC, over a period of maybe just 25 years or so. What we think happened was when someone died, if it was deemed appropriate that they become part of this place, then their body would be laid out, maybe nearby, maybe even in here in the passageway. And, then, the natural process of decomposition would begin and animals and birds would remove the flesh over a period of time. And, then, once there was little remaining but the skeleton, the bones, they would be gathered up and placed in the chambers. Now, there was a particular logic to this place. Old people and young people in separate chambers, on either side of the passageway. And, then, further in, maybe adult males and females, again separated on either side of the passageway. And, then, all the way at the back, just the remains of adult males. They weren't laid out as individuals, as intact skeletons. You'd have a pile of skulls, then a separate neat pile of vertebrae and another pile of long bones. And that was important, because what's going on is a process by which the loved ones cease to be just individuals, members of the community. They become part of one collective presence, the ancestors. Strangely though, tombs like this weren't sealed, but left open. In some ways, they were more akin to temples, which you could enter to commune with the spirits of the dead. And imagine what that felt like for people who truly believed that their loved ones, as well as the ancient dead, were somehow in here. That their will was in here. And that they were watching them and that they were aware. So, you would come in here, with great reverence and great respect, with the hairs going up on the back of your neck, and all over your body, as you wondered what would happen next. But these great structures also had an earthly fu nc tion. All around us, is rich and fertile farmland, highly valued. By building this here, the people are laying claim to it. This long barrow forged a permanent link between the community, their ancestors, and the fields they had farmed for generations. This is about the arrival of something new in our history, the concept of ownership. But the notion of ownership, the idea that a place, a territory, belonged to the tribe and their ancestors, was to have consequences. Up on top of this hill, is the site of one of the earliest examples of a great watershed in British history, armed conflict. Look at that for a view. That's the Severn Valley down there. Over there, ghostly in the mist, the Malvern Hills. Over in that direction, the Forest of Dean. Beyond that, the Black Mountains, and onwards into Wales. That's modern-day Gloucester down there. But, of course, five and a half thousand years ago, that landscape would've been predominantly woodland, with the occasional farmstead and cleared field. And, in a sense, whoever controlled this high-ground, controlled the landscape below. So, if you wanted to lay claim to all that valuable land, you had to take this, the top of Crickley Hill. And what's been found up here, is testament to that. Look at these. These are half a dozen flint arrowheads. And they're from a collection of around 450 complete arrowheads or fragments that were found scattered, all across the top of Crickley Hill. To my eye, these are just the most beautiful things. They're so symmetrical, so beautifully shaped. Look at the... Look at the profile of that. Look how fine it is, how much effort has gone into taking off infinite numbers of tiny flakes to produce that tear-shape arrowhead. But as well as appreciating the beauty of them... And some of these could be jewellery. As well as appreciating all of that, you have to appreciate that this is also evidence of the cruel intention to kill. 5,000 years ago, the long-bow was state-of-the-art technology. So, what we've got here is a Neolithic long-bow. This particular piece of wood is ash. It was cut down a year ago. So, therefore, it's not carrying too much moisture. That makes it nice and springy. Now, we've made a fairly heavy bow here. If it bends and it works, I hope your guy, Neil, has got some strength behind him, because this... Is no kid's bow. Pine resin makes a strong Neolithic glue to fix the arrowheads. And for the flights, crows'feathers. So, that is ready to go. In the attack on Crickley Hill, the Neolithic bow proved decisive. Right here, five and a half thousand years ago, the defenders were routed. I'll show you how to use it and then we'll see what you're like as an archer. 'Cause we're always looking for good archers on English territory. Not Scots, surely? You don't want that. - Oh! Dead centre. - So... Right, I'll do the Robin Hood shot now. - Let's see how you go. - I'll split that shaft. All right, I think I'll go for three fingers. - Righto. - Okay. Put some shoulder behind it. Give me another arrow. You go for it. I'm sure there's a lucky one in here for you. That looks more like it. It's clearly the arrow that was wrong. - Yeah. - As opposed to my technique. Oh. Yes. Even in the hands of a beginner, this weapon is lethal. An arrow fired from 30 metres would've gone straight through any medium-sized animal Or human. Right, Will. What's the damage? Well, as I think you're going to see... See, check that out, right the way through. And that's flesh and bones. So, that's what these things are capable of. And, of course, up here on Crickley Hill, it was being used against more than sides of pork. Human beings were the prey that day. You wouldn't want it in your leg, would you? I would not. Back at the Natural History Museum, there's direct evidence of this violent world. Look at this poor chap. The condition of his teeth suggests that he died probably in his mid-twenties. No older than that. And he died because someone smashed his skull in with a blunt object. Maybe a stone axe or a stone hammer. And the wound was inflicted with such force, that it caused this fracture line to radiate right round to the other side of his skull. He would've been killed instantly. And the violence, at that time, wasn't limited to the men. This is a woman's skull, and there's a wound here towards the front. And, then, much easier to see, there's another dimpled wound to the back of her head. But she survived the attack that caused these wounds. We know she survived because she lived long enough for the wounds to heal over, and she also lived long enough to have lost all of her teeth by the time she finally gave up the ghost. What we can say about this is really quite shocking. It means that if you lived in those first centuries of the Neolithic, at least between 4,000 and 3,000 BC, people would've known about, they would've witnessed and they might even have experienced extreme physical violence. There was a lot of it about. In just a few hundred years, the population of Britain exploded, from just a few thousand hunters to perhaps 100,000 farmers. As contact between groups became more freguent, people needed to find new ways of coming to terms with it without always killing one another. They also had to lay the foundations of a kind of local politics as well. It was as if they were saying, "It's not enough just to change the way we live, the way we work. "We'll have to invent society as well." This need to cooperate, to get along, gave birth to monuments on a truly grand scale. The very act of hundreds, or even thousands of people collaborating, would've bound Neolithic communities together. The earthworks they created are so vast, they remain etched into our landscape even today, despite the ravages of thousands of years of wind and rain. One of those giant monuments can be found here, in Wiltshire. The trouble is, it's so big, that up close, you can't even see it. I'm right in the middle of something archaeologists call a "cursus". This one is three kilometres long and one hundred and fifty metres wide. Some are even bigger. To be honest, you could be forgiven for walking right past it without even noticing. Down here, is the remains of a ditch. It's very shallow now. But it stretches almost as far as the eye can see. It's barely perceptible. But in its original form, it would've been quite distinct. Chalky white soil against the green of the grass. And it would've marked out the interior as a very long, thin, lozenge shape. These were originally called cursuses because they were thought to have been the remains of Roman race tracks. But, of course, we now know that they're much, much older. This thing was built by Neolithic farmers, 3,500 BC. Today, the only way to really get a sense of the shape of monuments like this, is from the air. Even from up here, it's not that easy to see. But after a while, you get your eye in and you begin to see what it is you're supposed to be looking at. From one end, the cursus can be seen cutting through a bank of trees, almost like a gigantic runway, disappearing off into the distance. What you're struck with, though, more than anything, is the scale of the thing. And what hits you, is the level of effort that was involved, not to mention the sheer determination. Of course, the big question is what does the shape symbolise? Is it a boundary? Is it a processional way? Is it even a narrow vessel designed to contain the dead? Perhaps, it's a bit of all of those things. But the simple truth is we don't know. But there are other monuments we do know more about. Massive earthworks, known as causewayed enclosures. And there's one! Three concentric circles, like three necklaces, looped around the hill Right down there. These monuments are meeting points, where people came for large gatherings, perhaps at special times of the year. For archaeologist Alasdair Whittle, they reveal the beginning of Stone Age society. Causewayed enclosures are very exciting places. And all sorts of things go on at them. So, they could, I don't know, settle disputes or meet husbands and wives, and marry people off? I think all of these things would've gone on. And do we have the artefacts? Do we have the things left behind? We have lots of artefacts. That's one of the big things about these sites, that they're rich in material and we have lots of artefacts. So, here we've got the top of the skull and the horn course, front level, as it's called, of a domesticated cow or ox. So, how old is that skull? A little over five and a half thousand years. That's a hugely significant find for me to see something like that. You know, that's... That's so early in the story of farming. The thought that that beast was walking the ground here when this was a shining white monument, looking out over woodland - five and a half thousand years ago. - Yes. And then it met its fate. Perhaps it was sacrificed, it was probably eaten. Then we can look at this pot here. And again, is this of a comparable age to the ox bone? This is the same age. So, we're looking at about five and a half thousand years old. I mean, it's so redolent of everything that the Neolithic is about. You know, the domesticated animals, the new ceramic, the new foods that were made possible because of this. I keep thinking of a time capsule. Is this a conscious effort for people to remember where they came from, how far they've come? I think it is. I think memory's very important. In coming to terms with a huge change. Coming to terms with a really big change in existence, which is being played out over these opening centuries of the Neolithic. The early monuments of the New Stone Age are about people coming to terms with a whole new world. Not only with each other, but the land itself, and their place within it This place encapsulates what these people, who lived in Britain, these early farmers, were trying to work out and to understand. And discoveries made here, go some way towards summing it all up. Look at this. This is the ankle bone of a domesticated cow. It was found buried within the ditch that encircles the topmost, innermost part of this hill. That's where all the pottery was found as well, incidentally. What it represents is the world that the farmers were trying to create. A safe, domesticated, controllable world. By contrast, look at this one. This is the ankle bone of a wild cow, an undomesticated animal. You can see right away how much bigger it is than the bone from the domesticated cow. Now, this wasn't found up here. Instead, this was buried right at the base of the hill. Down there, out there, is the dangerous world, the wild world, the uncontrolled, undomesticated world. And to me, there's something a little bit sad about that, because it's the wild world that the old way of life of the hunters was so in tune with. And yet, it was that world that the farmers were trying to be separate from, to cut themselves off from. Here, around 3,800 years BC, the farmers were trying to make sense of all of that in their own minds. Just where was the boundary between the wild and the domestic? Where had the brave, new world that they'd created actually brought them? It's as though they realised that now they had made their bed, and that they would have to lie in it. And, to some extent, so must we. Next time, my journey continues. Of course, what everybody's waiting for, is the sunrise. As I discover a whole new age... - Which one can I have? - Take them all. A time of elite travellers... - To actually feel it working. - Feel it. I wanted to hear it, I wanted to feel it. Now, that's a bit good. Vast, cosmic constructions... I see why you don't have this place open to the public, George. Yeah. And the very invention of heaven itself. When some people died, they were to be sent to a new place, a different place. Not down into the earth, but up into the sky. Ripped By mstoll
