 - Look at that. I'm five for five. - What's that? It's this test. the five pillars of happiness. Supposed to determine the level of contentment in your life. And it comes with a lotion sample. so you know it's scientific. I can't believe you would evaluate your life based on something in the Lifestyle section. Okay. that was obligatory. Bring it on. The first pillar is health. I gave myself a big yes. 'cause I just had my physical. Everything's where it's supposed to be. I'm running every day. and... well. Iook at those calves. It's like my knees swallowed a grapefruit.

 Your turn. I think I'm hypoglycemic. I'm always tired and I can't poop. I would give that a "no." Okay. pillar number two is family. - That's a big yes. You? - Well. Let's see. My mother's idea of bonding is making me scratch her back. and for my last birthday. my father gave me gum. That's another "no" for Grace. Moving on. Iove life. - Another "no" for Grace. - Excuse me! No. you can mark that "yes." thank you. Josh and I are doing great. I mean. it's not perfect. but we care about each other very much. Grace? Hey. what are you doing?

 You left an hour ago to get bagels. Here. Toast 'em up. I'll be back in 15. Okay. honey. Uh. your laundry is almost done. Well. you get a "no" on love life. too. Actually. I haven't told you this yet. but there's this lawyer. Alex. We've only had one date. but I'm already seeing 2.5 Jack Russell terriers and his-and-his SUVs in my future. Yeah. yeah. okay. Next. Okay. pillar number four. friendships. - Okay. now we're talking. - No. no. no. no. Note the "s." Friendships. They're talking more than just you and me. This test sucks. And the final pillar is work. I love my job. I work with a lush who insults me. Okay. final tally is... Will. Dee-de-de-lee-dee-dee Grace. Waa-waa-waa. You're not that happy. I've known you a very long time. There's always something bugging you. Come on. think hard. - What is rotten in your life? - I don't know. My life is-- okay. actually. there is something. I don't like how you've stopped having lunch with me at my office. You know why that is. I hate the view. Really? I thought it was because you hated Ben. That's what I meant. the view of Ben. Okay. I'll tell you what. We'll have him over. I'll make dinner. and all you have to make is nice. Think you can do that? - I can make nice. - All right. I'm always nice. - Sweetie. the bagels are ready. - Call me when they're cream-cheesed. - Love you. - Uh-huh. ( theme music playing ) Hey Care Bear. Something's bothering me. Can we talk? Sure. honey. Hey. are you wearing make-up? Nothing. really. just a little man-tan. - Your eyelashes look good. too. - Thanks. I'm wearing individuals. I'm concerned. Um... does Rosario seem different to you? Come to think of it. she sent me to work today with a juice box. I guess that means Mason went to school with a thermos full of Stoli. She's distant. she's distracted. She's getting a little handsy in her sleep. Last night. she rolled over and shook hands with Master Harold and the Boys. And let me tell you. they were not amused. I know. honey. but listen. it's been my experience that when problems arise between husband and wife. one should never point the finger of blame because it's always the husband's fault. I know what it is. Doilet-toilet. I forgot our anniversary. How insensitive of me. This is my wife. my significant otra. That's good. honey. Why don't you just run home right now and tell her how much she means to you? I would. but I have a date with Fernando. Oh. Well. then. why don't you pick up a little something. and bring it to her tonight? Something she'd love. Iike pork or Tinactin. No. not that. It has to be a more meaningful gift. I don't know. what's the traditional first anniversary gift? Ooh. well. Iet me try to remember. For my first anniversary. I got... a million dollars in cash. Paper. it's paper! Paper? Paper is so blah. Let me tell you. when the gays can get married. that's the first thing that goes. So we're at this dim sum restaurant downtown. - and they have this thing called bao-- - Yes. I know what bao is. I spent the summer at the Culinary lnstitute in Hong Kong. Personally. I prefer har gow. - Okay. not the point of the story. - Will: Anyway... so she decides to have some fun with the waiter. so she says. "What are these white puffy things?" And he says "Bao." So. I do. - "Okay. but what are they called?" - Bao. - "Okay. but what are they called?" - Bao! She did it like five or six times. ( Will and Grace laughing ) It was a very funny story. I guess the humor was derived from two things: One, that the two words sounded the same; two. that you made fun of someone who doesn't speak English very well. Funny people think it's funny. Really? How would you know? You know what. Benjamin? What do you want me to say. bow wow? All right. all right. all right. all right. all right. all right. Don't make me turn this car around or we're going home without ice cream! (phone rings ) Hello. Hi. Alex. I was just thinking about you. Okay. I wasn't. but I certainly am now. Let me take this outside. ( laughs ) - It bugs you. doesn't it? - What? When you're not the center of attention? It kills you. I can tell. - You think so? - Mmm. I know you. Ben. You're so focused on yourself and your whole Ben Doucette thing. But do you ever think of anyone else? Have you ever stopped to ask someone else what's up? What's up. Grace? No. I don't think so. that's not gonna work with me. We're talking about you. All right. fine. What do you want to know? How about something real? Something that doesn't involve the words "Porsche." "beach house" or "what's-her-name?" Mmm. Okay. something real. Well. I've been married twice-- first to the love of my life. who died 10 years ago. then to a woman who reminded me of my first wife. but was. I found out. nothing like her. I have two beautiful kids. one who's crazy about me and one who's not. And somehow. driving my Porsche to my beach house with what's-her-name. doesn't quite make up for the fact that the things I really want in my life are exactly what's missing from it. Wow. Is that true? All but the Porsche part. I drive a Mercedes now. S-Class. Any more questions. Grace? Um... how's the lamb? I made it. you know? It's really good. Grace. It's good. Date number two is set. The romance pillar is a little firmer-- Iet me rephrase that. Uh-oh. Grace. you didn't tell the irregular pantyhose story. did you? There was something in the air tonight The stars were bright. Fernando. What? ( sighs ) You know what? Now let me just give these to my wife. and then we'll go make out. - Okay. - Okay. Cha Cha. what are you doing home? I thought you had a date with Dennis. ( mocks spitting ) Not till 10:00. Anyway. Rosie. um... I know you're upset because I forgot our anniversary. but I'm just hoping that this will make up for it. Oh. so sweet. And since paper is the traditional first anniversary gift... Oh. Bounty. Now I can cross it off my list. Happy anniversary. Rosebud. Don't wait up. Is it safe? My husband's gone. but I would not say that it is safe. my little cup of crema de cacahuates. Rosie. can I have some cash-- Jennifer Love Hewitt! What the hell is going on here?! What can I say. chica? The heart wants what it wants. But you and Gardener? We're in love. We want to get married. Well. I guess it's clear. I'm the only one in this relationship who values the sanctity of marriage. Come on. Fernando! Mr. Zamir? - Mr. Zamir! - What? What? - What are you doing? - Nothing. I was walking my dog. - What dog? - Uh. where did he go? ( makes kissing sounds ) Doggy. doggy. doggy. Doggy. doggy. doggy. You were hunched over. reading a personal card to Grace. I would never do something like that. It is wrong. I'm glad you realize that. So. she has slept with a guy with named Ben last night. Let me see that. Uh. that's a filthy note. but also tender and gentle in spots. Grace and Ben? - Hey. - Will. what are you doing? I was helping Mr. Zamir look for his dog. I don't have a dog. You and Ben? Hey. you're the one who wanted us to make nice. We did. We made nice. Twice. You are unbelievable. You're the second guy to tell me that in the last 12 hours. Come on. Iaugh. Grace. he's my boss. Obviously. I didn't plan this thing with Ben. It just happened. It was just this wild chemical. "ripping off of a pair of $50 panties" kind of thing. Thank you. Grace. That'll go next to the visual of my grandmother getting out of the tub. Don't make me feel bad about this. Ben's a great guy. Besides. you have all five pillars of happiness. Let me have this one. But my boss? I mean. did you stop for one minute to-- you know what? I'm not gonna do this. This is your life. your decision. Enjoy it. Oh. Will. the passive-aggressive gay man. it's been done. No. no. no. no. This is relaxed fit gay man. I'm serious. I'm making a whole new choice with this conversation. See Ben. Honestly. it's fine. All right. I'm gonna take you at your word. because I do want to keep seeing him. Good. Terrific. have fun. Just leave me out of it. Last thing I need in my life right now is somebody else's drama. My wife is cheating on me! My life is ruined! Will. help me! Enter the drama queen. exit the neighbor. Can you believe this? She wants to divorce me and marry Gardener. I'm out on the street! That's shocking. Is there any way you can tell me about this without screeching like a howler monkey? You know what? I don't need you! I have plenty of friends who would be more than happy to help me through this! Goodbye! You don't even pretend to leave anymore. do you? This is serious. Will. I am about to lose everything. and I have a dog and a bird to support. Jack. it was a sham marriage. What are you going to do? Take Karen to court and demand she keep you in the lifestyle to which you've become accustomed? I'm not talking about-- I don't-- can I really do that? Mr. Doucette said that you should review the Blumen file. - Where is it? - I don't know. ask his assistant. - You are his assistant. - I just said I didn't know. Wow. is that your fun side? I'm just asking. 'cause I wouldn't want to miss it. ( sighs ) ( romantic jazz music playing ) - ( Grace laughs ) - You should consider yourself lucky. Why is that? 'Cause I get about $500 an hour for the work I do at this table. That's it? I wouldn't get out of bed for $500. Really? Will you take a check? All right. you either said something very romantic. or you called me a prostitute. - Whatever. sounded good. - Yeah. How you doing. Truman? Hi. Will. What can I do for you? Oh. I was just looking for the Blumen file. but hey. Mr. Blumen can wait. One more day in a Turkish prison never hurt anybody. Okay. okay. I'll get it for you. It's in my office. - You want to cut in? - Uh. - No. thank you. I'd rather not. - Aw. come on. cut in. This lady's gotta dance. See you later. sweetheart. You too. Grace. Oh. please. with the look. How many times did I have to watch you and Michael do "Summer Loving" from "Grease"? That wasn't a look. I was just looking at your skirt. Shouldn't you be on the dashboard of a cab. going... It's amazing. you know. when things are working in the relationship department. all those other pillars just fall into place. Me and my family are getting along. - I'm loving my job again. - Yeah. what about your health? Health's better too. but that's not Ben. that's bran. Hello. Karen. Hello. Grace. I am here on business. Oh. great. Put me down for two boxes of the Thin Mints. Okay. different business. Damn. now I want a cookie. Okay. I'll be back. This is in regard to the very tragic and devastating collapse of my marriage to Rosario. It's the laughter you'll remember. honey. Let's go buy make-up. And... even though one could never put a price on the pain and suffering this has caused me. one has. Jack. I don't read. I'm read to. Very well. Item one. $500.000 paid to me by you over the next four years. preferably in 50s. Item two. A Shetland pony dyed powder blue to match my eyes. Item three. powder blue eyes. - Item four-- - Wait a minute. wait a minute. Blanche! I'm still on item one. 500.000 in 50s? Yeah. I've always been turned on by one Benji Franklin. He wasn't afraid to wear his hair up and away from the face. Franklin's on the 100. you mook. And where do you get off asking me for 500K? Do you know how many times I had to... ( pants ) "Oh my God. Stan!" ( screams ) ...to get that? Well. we did have a contract. I gave you a year of my life so Rosario could stay in the country. I don't think a trust fund and a Corvette is too much to ask for. Are you kidding me with this? I plucked you out of a 4x4 hovel above a blinking light in Times Square. and I put you in a 6x6 maid's quarters on Park Avenue. - and this is the thanks I get?! - ( gasps ) Hey. you got something out of this too. Missy. Who read "Valley of the Dolls" to your kids every night? Who distracted Stan for you on Oyster Tuesdays? Me. It was me. Now I want my 500.000 in 50s! 50s with Ben Franklin on 'em! You know. you should think very carefully about what you're asking for. Miss Gurley Brown. You've got a good thing going here. and if you think that you can just shamelessly siphon cash off a loved one Iike I'm doing with my husband. you've got another thing comin'! I want my money. You ain't getting 88 cents from me. Rose. Very well. I will see you in court. By the way. your boobs look great today. It's a custom-made Jean Claus. came in from Paris yesterday. Get outta here! And at that point. the arbitrator will hear your side and Karen's side. and then he'll render his decision. But Jack. you've got to be more reasonable in your demands. I know it was a little excessive. but then just get me enough for the essentials. okay? Like food. clothing and bikini waxes. Well. that was good. That way we all win. ( phone rings ) Hello. Alex. hi! I'm so sorry about last night. I couldn't get out-- Tomorrow brunch? I will be there. I will absolutely be there. Okay, bye. Jack. he's straight and married. Yeah. so I am. - (jazz music playing ) - Oh. good. Grace is here. I'm gonna go tell her about Alex. Oh. you gotta go tell your wife about your boyfriend. ( Jack blows a raspberry ) Spooky. What? When you said that. you looked just like a woman. Gracie. good news-- oh. you're not Gracie. And this is not good news.
