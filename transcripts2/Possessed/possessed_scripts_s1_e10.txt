 ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, INCIDENTS, AND RELIGIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS From what I know, Chain Holdings is in charge of TF Group's logistics system. Meanwhile, our firm is still very small. May I ask why you chose our company instead? I chose you not the company. It's true that Chain Holdings is the biggest IT company when it comes to logistics. But it's more specialized in building servers instead of research and development. So instead of choosing a company,

 I listed up all the professionals and chose from that list. And it turns out you're unrivaled when it comes to logistics. Thank you. I look forward to working with you. If you show satisfactory results, I might even hire you as the research and development manager. I have a good eye for people. And you have a very good first impression. I hope we'll be able to work together for a long time. EPISODE 10 OWNER: OH SEONG-SIK 225-7, SAYUL-RI, SEOLPYEONG-MYEON OH SEONG-SIK You're going to quit? I don't think I can keep doing this.

 Did I upset you or something? Please don't ask why. What a pity. You've grown on me. You make a great underling. You know how to keep secrets, and you do everything you're told to do like a loyal dog. Like you just said, I worked really hard as your underling, so I want my pension. I won't ask for much. One billion won will do. Don't even think about doing anything funny. My guys are nearby, and if anything happens to me, I'm going to tell the cops about everything you did. I'll just leave quietly with the money before things get out of hand. So let's get this over with. What am I, a bank? Why would I have that much cash? I know there's a vault in your basement that's stacked with TF Group's slush fund all in cash. You're quick-witted and good at playing tricks. It will be such a waste to kill you. What? Kill? Worry about yourself, you psycho. Gosh, I can't believe you're holding a gun in Korea. Do you want me to tell you what's going to happen? You'll end up becoming more loyal to me. And you'll end up shooting all your minions with that gun. This isn't a toy. Go and get my money! Watch out. You are threatening me with a gun, yet you are afraid of the sound of guns. The military unit nearby is having a nighttime firearms training. Mr. Jang. Have you ever shot a gun before? Have you ever murdered anyone? Do you think I won't be able to shoot? What... What's going on? What? What... What's happening? Help... Help me! Please... Help... Help! What the... That bastard. Sir. Please don't kill me. I don't need your money. If you let me live, I swear that I'll stay quiet for the rest of my life. Goodness, my friend. I'm not going to kill you. All I'm going to do is make you become stronger. What do you mean? Let me introduce you to a very interesting friend. But this interesting friend has nowhere to live. People should help each other in times of need. So I'm going to let that friend stay at your place for a while. What... What is that? -He's here. -Let's go. Sir, did you get the money? He gave me a lot. You guys must be happy. Sir, let's split the money and part ways. Help me take care of something first. Mr. Oh asked me to bury something. Yes, sir. My gosh, sir. Why are we digging so deep? What in the world are we burying? -Lie down. -Pardon? I need to check if the hole is big enough, so lie down, you punk. Okay, sir. That will do. Good job, you guys. Is the stuff we need to bury in the car? No. Sir, stop joking around. Bye. Sir! Damn it! I need to bury them now. I brought what you asked. Limestone and sulfur powder. Aren't they the two things ghosts fear the most? If we use these to make a talisman, it'll be more effective in protecting us from the evil spirits. I want to help you catch Hwang Dae-du. Let me be a part of the historic event by helping you catch the notorious evil spirit. Don't you understand how dangerous this is? I, too, was born with a calling from the heavens. You've become way too corrupt to say that. The energy you got from the heavens are all gone now. You're no different than a normal human being. If you fight against Hwang Dae-du in that state, you won't be able to survive. I made something during the past couple of days. Would you like to take a look? I made a solution that will defeat the evil spirits. It includes mugwort, salt, red pepper, green onions, garlic, ginger and so on... Basically everything that evil spirits hate. If you spray this on Hwang Dae-du, it'll make him go nuts. And I coated these goggles with powder made from a coffin board and resin powder. So it'll protect me from being mind-controlled by him. If Hwang Dae-du gets cornered and tries to possess me, this will block him from doing so. Where did you even get all those? They're stuff I've been collecting until now. You're already helping me out a lot. So you shouldn't even think of doing anything that's unnecessary. -My lady. -Anyway, what did you say to Seung-kyung? I'm not allowed to disclose the secrets of nature. So I told her not to look for me because I need to do something very important for this world. What did she say to that? I'm going to destroy her. No. I'm going to crush her. This feeling of betrayal and anger... Hong Seo-jeong. How dare you steal my man from me? I'm going to destroy her. I'm going to crush her. Seo-jeong, that mean brat. I'm going to destroy her. I'm going to crush her. Are you coming home today? Are you pulling an all-nighter? Stop by tomorrow morning even if you have to work all night. Detective Choe, go to the interrogation room for me. I can't take it anymore. Kim Jun-gu still hasn't confessed? What is the world coming to? That bastard killed his own child, and yet he's not even batting an eye. If I spend any more time with him, I'll probably end up killing him. Just because his five-year-old daughter whined a little, he beat her up to the point that her bones were crushed. Then he just left his dead daughter at home and went to an Internet cafe. Does any of this make sense to you guys? You sound tired. You should go home and get some rest. I can't. The arrest warrant for that bastard expires tomorrow. If we fail to meet the requirements, we'll have to release that son of a bitch tomorrow. We're not going home today. We must make him confess tonight no matter what, okay? Jeez, is Jun-hyeong psychic or what? He always takes time off when things like this happen. Where did he go? Are we really going to sleep here tonight? Wouldn't it be too cold? We can only do this when we're young. And this experience will become another special memory. Zip up your sleeping bag. It'll keep you warm. I'm a little scared though. I'm right here, you know. But we're going to sleep separately in our own tents. I won't lay a finger on you until we get married. I see. Yeon-hui, this is what I think. This level of patience is a must for all men. Even if I must poke my thigh with a needle to restrain myself, I'll be sure to protect my lady's virginity. Is she asleep? My gosh. Oh, boy. Hey! My gosh. It's still early. Get back to bed. I'll wake you up in 30 minutes. Why? What is it? What? You remembered Daddy's birthday. Hey, where are you going? Let's have breakfast together. Have you ever seen me eat breakfast? Oh, right. Let's see. -What's this? -Your birthday gift. I'm sick of hearing you go on about how tired you are every single day, so don't forget to take one a day. I'm going to school! Wait! Just a second. What? What is it? Can I get just one hug from you? No, you can't. Baby, come on. Why not? Just one hug. It's my birthday, you know. Just once. Just one hug, okay? My gosh. Thank you, my dear daughter. Jeez, you stink! I told you to get changed often, didn't I? People will speak ill of me, not you. Are you crazy? Yes, I'm crazy. I'm going crazy because you're just so adorable. All right. Get going. Go on. -Shave your beard. -All right. OWNER OH SEONG-SIK OH SEONG-SIK OH SEONG-SIK CHAIRMAN OF TF GROUP 225-7, SAYUL-RI, SEOLPYEONG-MYEON OH SEONG-SIK Oh Seong-sik... Who... Who are you? The police. You totally caught me off guard. Goodness. I almost pissed my pants. Did you have to point your gun at me like that? I'm sorry. Just saying sorry won't cut it. Have a seat. If you're a cop, why were you wandering around this peaceful neighborhood? Is that house TF Group chairman Oh Seong-sik's vacation home? Oh, that house? I'm not supposed to share that kind of information. If you don't mind me asking, what kind of work do you? Me? I manage the vacation homes in this area, which belong to the chairmen of some of the biggest companies in the country. From the upkeep of the house and the surrounding areas to security, I oversee and manage everything. I see. Chairman Oh's vacation home looked empty though. If someone's there all the time, it should be called "home," not "vacation home." So, does Chairman Oh not use his vacation home often? He hasn't visited for a long time. Well, then... Why are you asking? Did something happen to that family? I need to gather information for an investigation. Please cooperate. I see. I bet his son got himself in trouble. I knew that would happen one day. His son? Who? Chairman Oh's youngest son. Does he come here often? He practically lives here these days. I'd like more information on him. Have you had dinner yet? No, not yet. Freshwater eel is the best, don't you think? So, about Chairman Oh's son... Senior Director Oh? He's such a narcissistic douchebag. Every weekend, he shows up with a bunch of girls from God knows where and parties all night long. Oh, right. He actually hasn't been bringing girls lately, but I've seen some punks going in and out of the house from time to time. -You mean, guys? -Yes. They always look so cautious. I guess they're trying to stay under the radar. They can't fly under my radar though. You see, people here call me "The Walking Wi-Fi." Is there anything else you know about Chairman Oh's son? Well... Anything can be helpful. Please tell me. The thing is... Can we order another serving of eel? Oh, sir. My gosh, it's okay. Please sit. I heard you've been working late every day. Yes. You're doing the work of three people. You must be swamped. Mr. Park praised you highly. He said you're very good at your job. Thank you. Is the system coming along nicely? The old system is actually pretty good, but errors seem to occur occasionally in the data warehouse software for inventory management, so I am trying to fix it. Also, the demand forecasting software, which uses data mining, doesn't seem to be completely accurate. And... When are you going to get off work? -Pardon me? -Do you want to have dinner with me? Don't get the wrong idea, please. I was just about to head home. Let's grab a quick bite to eat somewhere around here. -What about you, sir? -I have to drive, you know. Oh, then I won't drink either. It's okay. You can drink. It's always nice to have a drink after a long day of work. I'll drink this instead. Cheers. Thank you for your kind words. I really mean it. Because I've dealt with all kinds of people, first impressions usually tell me enough about the people I meet. When I first met you, I thought, "Oh, I'd like to work with her for a long time." That's how I felt. I'm serious. I'm a little psychic. When I look at people's faces I can figure out a lot of things about them. No way. You don't believe me? Then shall I take a guess? Judging from how tense you get in front of your superiors... Your parents... Especially your father. He must be the stern, quiet type. Doesn't everyone in our generation have a father like that? Judging from your behaviors and the way you speak, I think your father is probably a civil servant. Is he in the military or the police? I think he's a police. Am I right? How did you know? I told you I'm psychic. So? Is your father still in the police force? No. He passed away. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. I didn't know he passed away. When I look at you, I can picture what your father must've looked like as if I've met him in the past. Thank you for the delicious food and the ride. I really appreciate it. Oh, just a second. -Take this. It's Korean beef. -No, it's okay. One of our clients gave it to me as a gift, but I don't think I'll eat this at home, all by myself. I didn't buy it for you, so don't worry. Just take it home and enjoy it with your mother. Come on. Take it. Here. Thank you. No problem. You must be tired. Go on in and get some sleep. OH SU-HYEOK We can't be certain yet, but something's definitely off. Oh Su-hyeok? It's most likely him or one of the hoodlums who has been frequenting his vacation home. I'll tag along starting tomorrow. No, I should observe him first. We don't have time for that. I need to check which one is Hwang Dae-du myself. Will you be able to tell right away? I'll be able to tell for sure by looking right into his eyes or making physical contact. That's too dangerous. Hwang Dae-du knows who you are. We can't just sit around here and wait for him to show up. I may be able to sense something if I get to see him even from afar. Then let's do this. We already know who Oh Su-hyeok is, so I'll track down the hoodlums that have been hanging out with him. After that, you can check and see if one of them is Hwang Dae-du. My spiritual abilities do not compare with his. If you approach him carelessly, he'll figure it out right away. Be careful. Gosh, babe. Slow down. My gosh! Who is that? What the hell! You said this is your vacation home. This totally ruined my day. Go to hell. God damn it. Is she a psychic or what? Let me have some fun too, okay? Killing girls and mutilating their bodies after seducing them to sleep with you was your specialty, right? You were sentenced to death after killing six girls like that. I didn't give you this body just so that you can continue with your hobby. How dare you do this at my place? Mark my words. All you have to do is worship me and obey my orders. I'm your god and religion. If you get on my nerves one more time, I'll make you suffer eternally in Hell which I created. I'm going to Seoul for a few days. You'd better not do anything stupid. Just stay put. I'm just like any other men in their 30s. I want to be in love, and I think about getting married from time to time. I want to feel my heart flutter after falling in love with someone. Ji-hang, get in. This is my first time here. I should bring you here often from now on. A hoodlum just arrived at Senior Director Oh's vacation home. A hoodlum? Excuse me. Hello? Is this Anpyeong Police Station? I want to report someone who's driving under the influence. Damn it. What's going on? Damn it! -Do you mind if we run a breath test? -Why the sudden crackdown? Please breathe into it. No, not like that. You should-- For crying out loud. More, more, more. That's enough. My gosh, you drank quite a bit. I only had two glasses of beer. You're lucky. The BAC is right below the penalty level. You shouldn't drive under the influence regardless of how much you drank. I'll let you go since the BAC is below the penalty level. but you shouldn't drink and drive, okay? Got it. -What? What is it? -Give me your license. -You said you'll let me go. -My gosh, how rude. I still have to leave a record of it even if I let you go. -Give me your license. -What the hell? JANG CHUN-SEOP I'm Detective Kang Pil-seong from Sangdong Police Station. Can you tell me the identity of the man who just left? Name, Jang Chun-seop. He has six previous convictions. Convicted for forming a gang, committing assault, theft, and drug trafficking. He's got quite the record. Do you think he is Hwang Dae-du? I do not know. I cannot be sure. What about the CEO's son? He is in Seoul. I have to check on Jang Chun-seop first. Is there a way to lure him? I do not think there is a need to. I can already assume where he might be. Do you sense anything? It is too far. I have to get closer. If he is Hwang Dae-du, he will recognize you as soon as you approach him. How is this? You cannot recognize me, right? Why are you wearing sunglasses at night? I will go check it out. Welcome. Excuse me. I'm sorry, but can I use your bathroom? -It's over there. -Thank you. What is it? He was facing the other way so I could not sense him properly. This won't do. Just get out of there. I think I will be able to see his face while leaving the bathroom. Something does not feel right. If anything happens, I'll just leave. Don't worry. Welcome. Are you looking for someone? Thank you for letting me use the bathroom. What was that? Someone's possessed his body. Hwang Dae-du? No, it is not Hwang Dae-du. But there is an evil spirit inside his body. It was an evil spirit full of lust and bloodthirst. That means Oh Su-hyeok is Hwang Dae-du. Let's go back to Seoul. I felt a strong murderous spirit when I walked past him. He is going to kill someone tonight. We have to stop him. What do we do? If we try to stop him now, we might ruin everything. All we have to do is rescue the woman. Excuse me. The car with the plate number 9538 has its interior lights on. Thank you for reporting. Let's see... 9538. Oh, it belongs to the guest in room 406. You are pretty. There is no need to rush. Hold on. -What is it? -Sir. The interior lights of your car are on. What? What the hell? Shit. What is it? Hit the shower. I'll be right back up. The lights aren't on. What was he talking about? Fucking idiots. Are they all blind or something? Damn it! Didn't you take your key? Who are you? I don't have time to explain. Please follow me. The lights in my car weren't turned on, you idiot. -Sorry? -What an idiot. But, sir... Hold on. Hurry. We need to get out of here! I have to put on some clothes first! -Hold on. I think I forgot my phone. -What are you talking about? Shit, where did I put it? Fuck. Wait, hold on! Hey. Hurry up. -Get in. -Wait a second. Just get in. Keep your coffee shop closed and stay at home for the time being. Now go. Go! You there. You seem awfully familiar. It's you, Kang Pil-seong. Sorry, I meant Kim Nak-cheon. No wonder I got a chill down my spine. There's no need to be surprised. I've seen enough while locked inside Hwang Dae-du's soul. So why did you come for me instead of him? Gosh, I'm trembling. You know, killing me will only get you in trouble. What will you tell the police? Will you say you killed someone possessed by a ghost? Confident, are we? All right then. Son of a bitch! You bastard! Why does this situation seem so familiar? There's a good reason for that. -Are you all right? -Yes. Hwang Dae-du knows. Knows what? That I'm the one possessing Pil-seong's body. How... What will you do? Letting him live will only danger us. -No. -An evil spirit is possessing him. We'll take him to Hongsan and perish his evil spirit. You want to go all the way there? What if he wakes up and makes a fuss? We can't just kill a man though! I know a place we can go. I'm sorry to intrude without giving proper notice. I'm Oh Su-hyeok. That's my father. Yes, I know him well. Sorry? Nothing. You should've at least called. Here. Let me. -Goodness. Thank you. -No problem. How's your leg? It's good. I'll set a date for your surgery. I'm sure you know that we sponsor Hanwool Medical Center. The best surgeon in Korea will operate on you. I will be straight with you. I'd like to marry your daughter. Mr. Oh... I haven't known Ji-hang for long, so you might think I'm rushing into this. However, I'm certain that she's the one which is why I'm asking for your approval. Gosh, I'm too flustered to say anything. If you approve of us, I'll introduce Ji-hang to my parents this week. I sense great spiritual power. How do you know of this place? It was Hwang Dae-du's main base. He showed interest in necromancy too. Now I know why he chose this place. Get these cuffs off me. Let me go! I'm sure it's Hwang Dae-du you want. I'll help you catch him. Let's make a deal. Get out of his body. Me? Then I'll die. You're already dead anyway. You... You don't know who I am, do you? Well, let me get to know you then. Hold him down. You bastard. Do you really think I'd leave voluntarily? No, and don't even try. I'd rather you hold out. You'll be begging me to kill you. Hold on. What's this? It'll warm you up like heated floors do at home. Sooner or later, that warmth will feel like it's burning your skin. That's only the first period. The next lesson will be even more thrilling. I wonder how long you'll hold out. Will I or won't I? Will I or won't I? Wait. What? Shit, it's hot. It's hot! Get it off me. It's burning me! Don't be like that. It's not even as warm as a sauna yet. No, it's hot. It burns! It's hot. Hot! Please stop. Will you leave then? Bring on the second period. This is holy water. It's water from the heavens. It purifies souls. It'll have a different effect for evil spirits like you. Miss, you're quite considerate, aren't you? I was dying of thirst anyway, so give me some! It'll feel like your skin is being burned by hydrochloric acid. Try holding out once again. Give it to me! No! Shit, it burns! No! Okay, fine. I'll leave. Just stop! Stop! I get it now, so stop. Once a possessed soul leaves its host, it'll feel tremendous pain before it perishes. It's the punishment for violating the rules of the heavens. It'll suffer less if it comes into this pouch. What? It's the only mercy I can show you. If you are born again as a human after millions of years, I hope you'll live as a decent person. It's over now. He will need time to regain consciousness. It's cold, so stay in the car. I'll call you when he wakes up. No, I'd rather stay here too. THE EPILOGUE WILL CONTINUE SHORTLY Did I startle you? I feel like I'm bewitched. It's as if I'm in the clouds too. Things are just moving so fast. You don't hate me, do you? Your mother told me everything about your family history, and I'm glad that she did. You and your mother are two strong people. I promise you this. You and your mom will never suffer again. I'll make sure of it. Did you know that there is a fine line between pain and pleasure? We don't have much time left. What will happen once the door to Hell opens? Humans will destroy themselves. I burned my own father to crisp and learned that taking a life brings immense pleasure. You seem completely normal for someone who's possessed. You're still spewing nonsense not realizing what's what. Where did you take Ji-hang? Did something happen to my daughter? Keep it in mind... that we must kill Hwang Dae-du's soul as soon as we locate your daughter.
