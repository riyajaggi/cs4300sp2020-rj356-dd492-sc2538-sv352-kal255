 Don't forget you got swim practice today? Yep. I know. How's the shoulder feeling? - Is it still tight? - Sort of. You want me to call the doctor? I can set up an appointment. No, it's fine. It happens at the start of every season. It's not that big of a deal, Mom. It's Darren. You were about to ask who I'm texting. No, I wasn't. We drove him home two weeks ago. Don't bother with all that. It's all "OMG" and "AF," which means...

 Can I get the Red Sox bowl? The one we got when we went to Fenway and... Um... On the bottom shelf, there. Yeah, okay. I'll get it. Right. It's in the cabinet right there. You want a spoon for that?FLYNN: Sure. All right, I'm gonna get going. Hey, bud, I'm gonna get a haircut later on this week. You wanna come with me? All right. Yeah? Thanks. You wanna talk about it later at dinner? - Yeah. - Okay. I love you, guys. Bye. Can you sign this?EMILY: What is this? The state qualifying trip permission form. What? For when? Um, overnight, Springfield, Friday. I'm just hearing about this now? I told Dad weeks ago. Um, what's the big deal? Look, I need to hear about these things ahead of time, okay? The new swim coach just gave them out the other day, so... You got a new swim coach? Mr. Rizzo. That's him there. The guy with the white collared shirt?- All right, I gotta go.Okay. Try not to get into too much trouble.Okay. I will try. I love you. I love you, too. Bye. Go! And cartwheel your hands down. Chaturanga. Good. Inhale. Upward facing dog. And exhale. Downward facing dog. Hold for five breaths. Exhale. Come on. Inhale. Plant down through the root of your hands. Exhale. Good. Relax your shoulders. Inhale. Exhale. Are you okay? I'm sorry. It's just not gonna fucking work today. Tell me about Emily Byrne. Her psych eval was inconclusive. I think she's trouble, but I recall you were high on her earlier. Well, that was... Yeah, I get it. And what about you, Julianne? You settling in okay? There's been a certain amount of adjustments since I took over from Special Agent Crown. Don't sweat it. These things can take a little time. And on that note, I should run. Thanks for the talk, Foster. Talk soon. Take care. Okay. You're tipping. Like hell I am. Really? I'm not tipping shit. Watch. Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, tiger. I'm hungover. From last night? No, from the weekend. Hangovers last way longer when you're over 30. Yeah. Never again. I heard your reinstatement hearing's next week.Wow! No secrets at the FBI? I'm surprised you wanna come back. Why? Don't you miss me? I've had better partners. Nick Durand, FBI. You guys called? Yeah. Got a tip someone was dumping something that looked a little suspicious. Sent a car to take a look-see. Right over there. Same deal as the body you found last week. Thought you guys would be interested. Thanks. Hey, you okay, bud? Hey, Dad. I wanna go to Colorado this summer for a swim program. Colorado? Really? Well, I placed top three, and they'll even pay for room and board, so... That sounds great to me. Makes me happy, seeing you so passionate. But, you know, unfortunately, it's time for bed. So get some sleep. I love you. I miss Mom. I know you do. Do you miss her? Hey, what makes you say that? You never talk about her. You do miss her, right? I miss all of the good times... before everything happened. You doing okay, Dad? Yeah, I'm good. Thanks for asking, bud. I'll see you in the morning. Hey. It's an absolutely crazy day. Nick. Yeah? He deserves to know the whole truth. Not just some half-assed lie. Um... We've been through this. Too much info about this could traumatize him. Well, did you also hear him mention the swim camp in Colorado this summer? In Colorado? For the whole summer? It's what he wants. I just barely agreed to two days in Springfield. Getting away from things here, it might be good for him. Give him a little breathing space to grow up. You know what? I looked into his swim coach. Rizzo. Rizzo? Yeah. Wait. What? Is there something I should know? I'm sorry. Never mind. This is just... This is all me. Enjoy. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, she's really nice. I mean, I like her. Okay. I get it, Mom. I mean... Okay. Maybe I can bring her over for dinner, I don't know, like next Friday or something? Yeah, I don't know why you always gotta meet them so early. I mean, just give me some time. No, I want you to meet her, right? I told you, she's great. I mean, she's a high school teacher. Some of my swimmers are her students. I really think you're gonna like her. Yeah. Yes, I put on music. No, the music doesn't mean I don't wanna talk to you. I just wanna play some music. I know, Mom. I know. Yeah, no, I said next Friday. I can do next Friday. No, she's not another blonde, okay? Just... Okay. All right, I really do have to go, all right? Guns and gangs are handling that Dorchester seizure, and Agent Serrano's RICO case is wrapping up. Any updates on your murder investigation? According to BPD, the body of the young boy was the third they found this month. Each had some of their organs missing. Are you thinking serial killer? Actually, no, but it does fit another ongoing investigation. How's that? I had someone come forward with information about the body. I'm gonna see where it leads. Right now, I'm waiting for my source to give me actionable intel. And keep us posted. Okay, that's it for now. Agent Durand? Yeah? A word in my office. I just wanted to check in. See how you were doing. I heard you haven't been attending your mandated counseling sessions. I think I've gotten all I can out of them. And I'm going to the gym, work things out. I'm just... Just ready to put things behind me. Focus on the work. It may sound strange, but if, um... If I can be of any help, please don't hesitate to ask. What, are you spying on someone? No, just recaffeinating. Can you believe she' got me fact checking Serrano's RICO case? Nothing but a "make work" project to waste my goddamn time. We've all got grunt work to do. You just forgot how it feels. Fuck off. Hey, Canto, can I ask you something? Yeah, sure. Do you like working for Gunnarsen? It's complicated. Is it true that she... Nick Durand's wife? Yep. Investigated and exonerated. Justified shooting. That's so fucked. Yep. It's not a planet? Or it is a planet? It's not a planet. It was downgraded. It got upgraded again. Again? - It's a planet. - Really? What happened? When did they decide to do that? I don't know. They can do what they want. I should read up more about our solar system. Who are the people who decide? I'll be back.Excuse me. Before, you were starting to say something about this other planet. - What was it? - Bamberga, yeah. I traded my shift. Not too late, am I? Come on in. I'm happy you're here. Yeah, me too. - Hey. - Hey. I'm glad you were able to make it. Did you leave any food for me? - You betcha. - Plenty! We got lasagna. We've got some more salad. Yeah, I got you. Thank you. No problem. Hey, Flynn. How are you doing?I'm good. - How have you been? - Been busy. Straight from the hospital? No, I did have a shift, but I canceled it with the assistance of my sister. She can be convincing. She can. Flynn seems to be coping well, all things considered. Yeah, somedays I think he is, and then... Trust me. I know a moody teenager when I see one. Flynn's doing good. And that's on you. Here, Dad. So... You and Nick are... No, Dad. No, and we are both okay with it. So what do you call it? Platonic, Dad. It is what it is, so that Flynn can have a safe, normal home to grow up in. After I left the army, I was itching to get married and have kids. Just happened to me later than most. Have to think these things have a way of working themselves out in their own way. Yeah, well, so far, so good. Whatever you call it, you and Nick seem to be pulling it off, and we're all better for it. I'm proud of you, Em. Thanks, Dad. Hey, so heard you work in an ER now. Like, a few days on. Then you have a few off. Or is it like... No, shift work mostly. Yeah, it's very different to the OR. It's intense, but I'd say that... Um... Can I... Could I get a water, actually? Do you mind? Yeah, sure, man. Great, thank you. I got it. I got it. I'll get it for you. Don't worry. Thank you.Terrible host. Water for Jack. Nice. I was wondering where you were. Hey. What are you doing? I was... I was just looking at some things. These are Alice's things. Nick hasn't had... Yeah. Yeah. ...a chance to... You did it, didn't you? Jack. Jack, is it true? Is it true? After everything that this family has been through, what the hell were you thinking? Fuck. Flynn has been through enough. You understand? Tell me you understand. I would never say anything. I'll see you downstairs. Let's move! Don't want Flynn to miss the team bus to Springfield! Call me when you get there, yeah?I will. Here you go, bud. All right, be safe, okay? Yeah. Good luck! Good to see you, Jack. Yeah, you too. Hey, don't be a stranger, okay? It's been a long time. See you, sis. That was very nice. Good to have everybody over. Yeah. Are you okay Yeah, just got some dishes to do. Who are you? Please... What are you doing here? Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa! I came for him. I came for him.Nick, who is this girl? It's okay. She's my source. She's your source? Regarding the body that I was called in to yesterday. It's okay. I trust her. They found another one. I know. I was there. Why'd you come to our house? They watch us. You can't just walk into the FBI. My son lives here. I didn't know what to do, okay? I'm sure that she wouldn't have come... If they find out I'm talking to you, they'll kill me. ...if she didn't have a good reason. Okay, fine, what is this good reason? You told me you wanted proof. Tonight, something's going down. I need at least 24 hours. I can't... It's happening tonight. You need to go right now. Please. Okay, can you take me there? No, I'll give you an address, but I'm not going there. God. Okay? You go. See it with your own eyes. Then you have to put me in protection. If this checks out, I will call you tomorrow. No calls. We do this in person as we agreed. Done. Good. I'm sorry. We'll talk about this later. I have to go. Nick, you don't know if what that girl was saying is the truth. The FBI barely knows anything about these bodies. Fine, then do this the right way and get a team together. You heard her. This is happening right now. I don't have time to put a team together. I gotta see it for myself. This is too dangerous to do on your own. Am I doing this on my own? Come on. Come with me. This is Special Agent Durand, requesting immediate backup at the Garneau Industrial Park. Make an incision, for a kidney. Yeah, go ahead. FBI! I got him! I got him! They found another makeshift operating room on the far side. Transplanted recipient was whisked away in a car once all hell broke loose. Doctor and the guard got away. Organ-harvesting ring. Explains all the recent dead bodies. So your source was right. Maybe she'll be able to help me find out who's behind all this. Glad you're okay. None had ID. A cursory look suggests that they may be of Middle Eastern or South Asian background, but we're not sure if that's a connection or coincidence yet. But here's where it gets interesting. Pathology found dirt under the fingernails, and the preliminary autopsy findings suggest malnutrition. I'm hoping that... - Sir. - Sir. Deputy Director Webb saw the bulletin this morning about your organ harvesting bust and wanted to know more. I'm just catching everyone up. Please continue, Special Agent Durand. I'm hoping that a tox screen tells us more. And how did they end up in Boston? That's a good question. Um... Undocumented people being smuggled into our country without anyone knowing they're here does present a potential national security issue. Any idea who's behind this operation? Not yet, but my source claims to have more information for us. So last night may be the tip of the iceberg? I'm meeting my source tonight to work out details of their cooperation. This is Webb. Go ahead. So, as I was saying, I'm hoping that the tox screen tells us more.Special Agent Durand, a word in my office. It's all yours. What was Agent Byrne's role in the organ-harvesting takedown? Emily came as my backup, but I didn't have a chance... She's under FBI suspension and can't be involved. Is that clear? Crystal. This source, you trust the intel? After last night, yeah, I do. Tell me about him or her. With all due respect, you know I can't really do that. Fair enough. There's no good way to say this, so I'm gonna cut to the chase. I've seen Emily watching me outside my place. At first, I wasn't sure it was her, but then I saw her a second time. Clearly, she doesn't accept the DOJ exonerating me for Alice's shooting, but I need you to tell her this ends now. She's seen you outside of her place. Watching it. Watching her. And you believe Gunnarsen over me? Just tell me, is it true? You weren't on that rooftop, Nick. You know that? No, I wasn't, and I think about that every day, but now I... I'm... I'm just trying to move on. Well, I'm just trying to protect our son. Me too, but, Em, this is... What you're doing is not okay. You know that. Right? If you keep this up, they won't let you back. They'll never let you back. I don't want to go back. There you go. I need to get some air. Talk about this later. Em, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on. Yeah, good luck with that. I'm bolting. Listen, we messed up. Change of plans. They're questioning everyone so I sucked up a ton of their data, hacked their drives, locked them out. Okay. You need to come in with me. No, no, no. There's no more time now, okay? It's too late for that. Sorry. Excuse me. Have you seen... Something happened. She got spooked and ran away. Did you see anyone? I think someone's here. Nick? Nick. Hey. Cal, Nick's in trouble. I need you to meet me at the house. On my way. Motherfucker! [FLOOR THUDS
