 Okay. Easy. You were supposed to be the only one who knew. I know. Look, it got FUBARed. What? Crown had Thompson and Canto tailing you. They were already at the mall. I tried to pull them back, but it was too late. So everybody knew where she was. More or less. Fuck. Cal... There was a text. Dawkins got a text in the middle of our conversation. I saw it. He knew where she was.What? He knew where Nick lived. He had my Quantico files. Somebody here is feeding him information.Who? - Hey, any idea who? - Emily. We're hoping you can shed some light on this shit show for us. And then, Dawkins showed me a video of Nick alive in Europe. And it was live? Yeah. Do you have this proof-of-life video? No. But I saw the feed. And we almost had the IP address pinpointed until things went sideways. Okay, it's not ideal, but at least we know he's still alive. Let's back up. Why were you meeting Dawkins in the first place? 'Cause I was trying to get Nick back. By interacting directly with a dangerous criminal? Yes! Whatever it takes. Deputy Director Webb will be here within the hour. Thank you. I'm going to let Washington know we may have an agent being held hostage in Europe. We'll notify State Department and reach out to our attache offices. They'll coordinate with local authorities... Julianne, that's going to take weeks. I know our overseas presence is limited, which is why I'll be reaching out to the CIA for intelligence. I'm not interested in the red tape bullshit. What I wanna know is what are you doing right now to get Nick back? My number one priority is bringing him home, Emily. Now we should be working together on this, and yet here we are, two steps behind you, and I wanna know why. Because I don't work with people I can't trust. Do you mind giving us a minute? Care to elaborate on that last comment? Nick came to the FBI, and he said that he had a source. And then, 12 hours later, that source was burned. Dawkins had my Quantico file, something that only the FBI is supposed to have. Just so I'm clear, what are you insinuating? The reason that you guys are two steps behind is someone here is keeping it that way. I've always admired your instincts as an agent, Emily, especially given what you've been through. And I still very much see you as a valuable part of the Bureau's future. Having said that, I'm sure you understand how an accusation like that can have an irreparable effect on someone's career. My future here was over the day that you killed Nick's wife. I saved your life on that rooftop. Is that the bed you sleep in? Alice had a gun pointed at my agent. She'd murdered a man hours before. Your life was threatened. I did what we're trained to do. You had thousands of choices you could have made in that moment. I stand by my decision. You feel threatened by someone like Alice? How do you feel now? Byrne, go home. We're done. Why did you do it? Why did you kill her? Why did you use lethal force? I'm ordering you to walk away. Don't prove your psych evaluations right by doing... Fuck you. And fuck this place. I quit. Come on. This incident doesn't leave the office. Son of a... Can we meet tonight? I need to talk to you. After the disappearance of Emily Byrne, her family made a statement to the media about the circumstances behind the mysterious disappearance. The FBI agent has been with the Bureau for several years, and is married to Nick Durand, who is also an agent... Come in. Anything else for you, sir? Did you bring the sugar? Would you oblige and put four sachets into the vase and swirl? Thank you. This is for the scotch and the sugar. You can go. No comment from law enforcement about shots fired at a local mall. Three victims were removed from the scene. Witnesses described multiple sources of gunfire, as shoppers took cover. Law enforcement released this photo of an unidentified suspect. Shit. Smiley, haven't seen you in a while. Darius. How's it going? Same shit, different day. Listen, I need a favor. Got anything that can read this? Don't see one of those every day. Just a minute. I'll put it on your tab. Number eight is secure. Come on. Fuck. Water. Water, please? I don't like it. Don't like the drugs. I need some water. Water. Please. Please. Please... The stolen files. Where are they? You have to tell them, or it will get worse. The girl you were protecting is dead. You have to tell them what you know. The only reason they're keeping you alive is because they think you know where the files are. I wanna speak to your boss. Okay. We'll have to do this another way, then. No, no, no, no. No, no. No, please. Hey. Hey. How are you? I'm fine. I just, snapped. Yeah, you're human. It happens. Listen. Forensics went through Nick's office computer. They were trying to find something that could relate to this case. And they... They found something. Given what you said earlier, I'd rather tell you in person. Usual place? Okay. Yeah. I'll be there. - Hey. - Hey. So, what did they find? Boston shipping business registered to an offshore shell company. Hi, we're here. Dawkins is still in Boston. Someone broke into my car. What? He's after me. Let me bring you in. We can protect you and your family. I don't think we're safe with the FBI. He's going to try and kill you. He can't kill me. He needs me alive. I've got the Meridian files. Yeah? What's in the files? I don't know. I don't know for sure, but... Kompromat on politicians, people that they're blackmailing, all kinds of stuff. Yeah? You have it some place safe? Yeah. Good. Here's your check. More coffee? Thank you. What happened wasn't your fault. I promised her that I would keep her safe. I just keep pulling people into this chaos. And, in the end, no one's gonna be left standing. "Never fear to deliberately walk through dark places, "for that is how we reach the light on the other side." Vernon Howard. Do you want to go find the shipping place? Yeah. Hey, got the shipping logs. Cal, look. Sedatives. That's the same day that we busted the organ-harvesting operation. Yeah. They're all incoming shipments, except this one. There's one outgoing shipment on a cargo plane to Berlin. That might be how they got Nick out of the country. On the reverse route, which was authorized by... Jericho. What's Jericho? Is that a person, a company, or a place? I'll check our contacts in Berlin to see if they know what Jericho might be, and if they can pick up the trail after that plane landed. Okay, sounds good. Emily. I'm assuming you have the files Dawkins wants hidden away somewhere. Yeah. Excuse me. Hi. My name is Walker. I'm a scout for the college. Hello. I believe you have something I still need. Just give me Kai's files, and I'll be on my merry way. Surely, you and I can come to some sort of arrangement. Otherwise, I've got to redirect my attention to get what I need. To your family, perhaps. I need time to get the files. Then I suggest you get them while you still have time. I'll see you soon. Ems? Dad, are you still at Flynn's swim practice? I just dropped him off about 10 minutes ago. I've been doing some errands. I need you to go back. Why? What's wrong? The people that took Nick are after Flynn. I'm five minutes away. I'll call you when I have him. Flynn? Flynn? Flynn! If you're here, show yourself. Grandpa! Hey. Come on. Get your things. Do you have him? Yeah, we're safe. We're just about to head back to Jack's. No. You have to leave town now. Got it. I'll meet you at that motel off 93. Right. Hey. Hey. Hey, how you feeling? I'm okay. I handled it. I'm not a little kid anymore. Yeah? I know you're not a kid. Okay? But the people who took your dad, they're still out there, and they're dangerous, so we gotta be extra careful. How long till you get Dad back? I don't know. But I promise you, I am not going to stop until I find him. All right. I'll take care of Grandpa. Em, you have the phone?Yeah. Here. How long are we looking at? I don't know. But Nick's alive, and I gotta bring him back. So, um, just make sure you take the back roads, Dad, okay? I know how to lose a tail. Yeah. Stay strong. I'll call Jack. I'll tell him you guys are headed up to the farmhouse, okay? Sounds good. Given my knowledge of Byrne's history, she should have been detained on assault. What set her off? She was understandably frustrated at the FBI's handling of Durand's abduction, given the bureau's inability to resolve her own case. Well, understandable crossed the line into inexcusable. Yeah, as long as Nick Durand is still missing, Byrne is the least of my worries. As far as I'm concerned, her resignation means she won't be a problem for this office anymore. You're better off without her, Julianne. Where are we with Meridian? We're gonna touch base with INTERPOL, see if they have any additional intel. Given the optics on this case, I want to be looped in on the specifics from here on out. I'll touch base with NSA, CIA, and State to see what else they have on Meridian. Am I keeping you from something? No. Dinner plans, but I can cancel. No. Sounds better than the salad I have stashed in the fridge. Go. I got things covered here. Thanks. I'll be back within the hour. Hey. Hey. I thought you hated this place. It's, convenient. Thanks for coming. It's good to see you. They're using the Special Agent in Charge as a battering ram now? More of a punching bag, but I'm fine. Courtesy of? An ex agent. Emily Byrne? Be coy all you want, but you're the one who said you wanted to talk to someone. You always bottle everything up, and then someone shakes you one good time... Fine, it was Byrne. She's just not FBI. She's all guts and instinct. Maybe that's why she gets to you more than the others. What's that supposed to mean? You're not the most emotionally connected person, Julianne. So this is about me, now? You called me, remember? Why? Why now? Byrne thinks there is an informant in the office. She thinks it's me. I know you, Julianne. You don't really care what people think about you. You're worried this will kill your career. My career is not... The most important thing to you, yeah. You've made that very clear. That's not fair. But it's the truth. I respect that you give everything to your job. But there's nothing left for the rest of us. I'm sorry. Please, don't go. I've missed you. Flynn. What was going through your mind as you chased Mills? ...five missing persons cases. Um, I had to catch him. The FBI have only been able to make a case against him... ...macabre signature, removing the eyelids. And somewhere in these woods, you did catch him. But I beg of you, don't take this out... You know it was the only choice he had. ...case against him for the murder of FBI agents... Turn it off. He knew that I would shoot him. The FBI have only been able to make a case against him for the murder of FBI agent... Turn it off. Make it stop. Make it stop! Bring my wife... And I will send them home... Please bring them home. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Got something for you.Yeah. A hot meal and a pillow?Better. I spoke to a hotel manager whose bellhop bragged about a large $100 tip from a man matching Dawkins' description. Manager says they've recently got him coming into the hotel on camera with no signs of having left yet. Does Crown know? Can't find him. How about Gunnarsen? Haven't seen her. Here she comes. Gunnarsen. I think I got a clue on Dawkins. In my office. Derek, quick. We got a lead on Dawkins. Hey. You're back. Hey. Listen, I need you to replicate this. It doesn't need to work. It just needs to look right. It's gonna be tricky to clone, but let me see what I can do. Hey. Dead end on Jericho, but we got a bead on Dawkins. A tip came in from his hotel. We're on our way to check security camera footage right now. Let's go. Yeah, yeah. Where are you? I'm at Jack's. Cal, now. Okay, I gotta go. Back in a minute. Hey, it's Emily. Byrne. Look, I know it's late out there. I just, um... Look, I wouldn't be calling you unless I was desperate. I really need your help right now. I had to catch him... The FBI... Hello, Nick. I had to catch him. The serial killer's macabre signature, removing the eyelids. Remember, Dawkins is a trained killer. If necessary, take the shot. Roger that. Hey. Just crossed the state line about an hour ago. Flynn's asleep. Good. Love you, honey. You take care. Come on. - Clear. - Clear. All clear. Fuck! Goddamn it. This is Gunnarsen. Dawkins is gone. Hey. We just raided Dawkins' suite. He's not here. Emily, you're not surprised. Emily? I'm sorry, Cal. I hope you're not disappointed. What are you doing? So... Let's go to Jericho. I'm glad you've finally come to your senses, Ms. Byrne. I'm kind of bored of asking, but have you got it? Yeah. The files for Nick's life. Lovely. Let's go, Mr. Sykes.
