 - I'm from the FBI. - Don't move! I don't want to shoot you! Stop! - I'm working for the FBI! - Lie still. I work for the FBI. Let go of me! We check his phone. Thanks. The technicians have not found the weapon, Oduwale was shot with. The Boston fine-grained area by witnesses. They also check his phone. If anything, we will find it. The explosion should divert us. They wanted to close his mouth, before he got to know. - What did he say? - There's here. He ordered the fentanyl killings. He got Tommy murdered. Did he mention an accomplice? - An enemy? - No, nothing. Someone wanted to get rid of him. - Nothing? - Not yet. Look. We examine evidence from Oduwale's home. He saved everything. So what? Shen had that kind of tape. Emily, we gotta talk. Okay. Close the door. Did you get us to question dr. Oduwale to perform this play? - We needed information ... - And it does it okay? He gave us nothing, Derek. People are watching you and hope you make a mistake. - This has hurt both of us. - Pardon. I recorded it all. - He lived when we left the house. - But is dead now. I have to find out what he did to my son. Come on. You will be accountable for this. Sorry. I can't protect you. I know. - Hi. It is late. What will you? - You don't reply to my text messages. There is new. Fast, thank you. Nick is coming soon. I got my authorization. It's great. I am very pleased. Thanks. - Should we meet somewhere? - I have Flynn. He can handle himself. Stop now. It's over. Just like that? Because you say that? You haven't given us a chance. - I'm putting on now. - Then I'll pass by! What did you say? You can't just drop me. We are good together. You find someone else. I'm another with you. Previously I did things ... What do you mean? Without you I might fall back. I can not help you. We had something that was good for both of us, but not love. You put on me. What do you get out of it? Or do you flee? I put on. - Are any of the records Flynns? - No not at all. I've only seen ordinary records. Maybe he was just their normal treats. I was there. Nothing weird happened. Alice says he focused on to help children with trauma. He was in the catacombs. Nothing is random. Unbelievable. We have scraped the catacombs. There was no DNA from others. But he was there. I heard him. And I remembered. We've found something. - Why are you up? - Do you smoke? Revealed. I hardly smoke. Say nothing to your father. - You seem sad? - No. I just wanted to ... Long day. I'm trying to drive down. - What about a bite to eat? - Yeah okay. We have found encrypted emails in the "Home Improvement" file. We have tried to decrypt them, but without luck. They come from the same IP address. He has changed email often. Oduwale did not respond. - And they were hidden and hidden? - Yes, seven years back. Strange that Oduwale did not answer them. But he uploaded them to a remote server. The engineers found a server that got backups from Oduwale's computer. Get out and be careful. We don't know what to expect. No one here! Thanks, guys. No one here. He didn't have full access. See all the Catalyst folders. We call the technicians. They are several years old. It must be Clay Bishops journal. It all fits him. Two ACL injuries, 195 cm high. Domestic violence. Yes, it's him. - We're in there. Thanks. - So little. If he wrote to others, we may find addresses. Let's see ... These are encrypted. It will take days. Here are backups to "Home Improvement". Here are some saved emails. I'll show you the process, but you must abandon your moral principles. Laurie Coulson. It is a unique opportunity to study a unique topic with your help. It is me. Want something? Coffee? No, but thank you. That is the last thing I should drink. Did you find anything? Alice, dr. Oduwale is dead. He was murdered. I know he was your mentor, though he was a terrible man. He was behind the fentanyl killings and experimenting on Emily. Oh no. He looked Flynn in the eyes and said, he was there for him - - When he tried to crush our family. We closed the devil. Sorry, Nick. Had I known it, he was never entered our lives. - You didn't know. - He meant everything to me. Okay, we'll see you next week. Your task of failure and brain development ... Inspirational. Love it. I have it here somewhere. I would tell you first. I ... I'm jumping off. - What now? - It's not me. I can do more in the field. I want to help children. Children who are as I was. You are one of my best students and have a bright future ahead of you. I understand what you mean, But I think you should stay. If you do ... I've been looking for an assistant to to help with my patients. Not in a laboratory. I need one with your talent and your unique look. I ask you, think about it. Okay. He pretended to help their patients and students. But they were experimental rabbits. He's dead now, so he can't hurt us anymore. Let us sleep. I am sorry. Do you think ... everything is normal again? What is normal in this family? As long as we look after each other, it should go. Yes. - Can I help? - Yes. Say you go back to D.C. No. It is not. I'm going straight to the case. - About what? - You were a skilled field agent. I'll give you the chance again. Excuse me? Deputy Director Webb believes, Boston needs a new leader. An outside, that can look objectively at things. So now is the time to give me a kick. You won't be fired. Only downgraded. Web calls you. I think ... I'm not just lying down. You have high friends. I also have friends. Your handling of this crisis has been questionable. You were too busy with Leon. TBM was killed during the transfer. Your relationship with your agents destroyed your judgment. My advice is, that you draw without protests. You get a few more days to leave my office. Run me. Can we talk, Nick? I think we should go a camping trip. You, me and Flynn. The investigation is in progress. Not a whole month, but we need it as a family. Okay. Let's do it. Then we can get away a little. I can take care of you two. - But ... - What? - You hate your tent trips. - I'll give it a shot. Maybe I learn to love it. Something in Oduwale's records? No. No clues to who killed Oduwale. No accomplices. Nothing. Before we have broken the encryption Oduwale's server, we can do nothing. Listen up ... You need a break. Came. We gotta get some air. What's special about the place here? It is quiet here. In the middle of nothing. I love that song. Moment. You were good in Moldova. Well, you were there. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to speak about all this shit! Go to hell! Here. - What am I supposed to do with it? - Try to hit it here. Seriously? - Ready? - Yes. Yes! Now it's your turn. Yes? Okay. Focus. Focus. - You wanted to talk to me. - Yes. I wanted to prepare you on some things. Derek Crown is no longer a boss for the housing office. I'm taking over. Something needs to be done by the mess and the working environment. Why am I being notified personally? I decide the consequences of yours behavior, the evening dr. Oduwale died. - Do you burn me? - Not really. I've seen how valuable you are. Except for Oduwale. - What now? - Your case will be judged next week. I recommend suspension, not dismissal. I want to do everything to keep you here, Emily. You belong here. The engineers have broken the encryption on Oduwale's server. Came. - Are you okay, mother? - I'm not made of glass, Flynn. But I can't see the fat in it. Man against nature. We test our survival capabilities. Father teaches me cool things. Come on. - Hey, Em. - What happens? They are inside his hard drive. I'm looking at the files now. Decades of medical records and blood tests from Catalyst. Hundreds of patients. - Yes. Thanks. - Oduwale's phone. Quickly. Thanks. Are you missing a hand? Should I come in? No, Nick. We must not destroy it for Flynn. Emily manages it. You're home tomorrow. Call if you find anything. Okay. Let's go. ATTEMPT PERSON: FLYNN DURAND Hello. Byrne? Two seconds. Oduwale analyzed Flynn's blood. Here is Flynn's blood tests. How did he do that? Only Alice and Nick may have known about it. I do not feel so good. Maybe some bad food. Want a break? Continue I. I'm just going home. Come on mom. You said yes. Yes. But I need to lie down in a dry place. In my own bed. I do not want to ruin your trip so i just slip. - Are you sure, honey? - Yes. Take the car. Can you pick us up tomorrow? Yes. Be careful. I love you. Oduwale called this number several times two days before he died. The last thing he called. It's Alice's number. It is ... Look at the times. We left his office. There are four more conversations afterwards, and saw it here. Right after the interrogation. Why call Alice? - Emily. - Hi. - Do you keep up early? - I have errands. - Can we just talk? - Okay. - Is that okay here? - Yes. - Don't you take it? - No. Where was she when he died? We must ping a cell phone! Emily. Alice's phone pinged a mobile mast 6.5 kilometers - - from dr. Oduwale before he died. She was there. Thank God you came. Help me before she comes back. - Mother really misses something. - Yes I know. This is pretty cool. - Hi! - Is Alice there? No, she went home. So what? - Where's Flynn? - Together with me. What is it? Alice was with Oduwale, when he was killed. No that ... There must be an explanation. - Flynn got many blood samples. - Yes, he would. No, they were in Oduwale. - She ... - She must be found. Their ... She took the car. She wanted to go home. I'm going home to you. - We can't get away. - I find her. Keep track of her. - What do we have? - A traffic camera caught her. Nick? If we had found the body, I wouldn't have it like this. How? Like she's here. Her stuff is here. - The memories are ... - Memories can be a comfort. As a well, you take water away. With moderation. I wish I could turn it off. Reset everything. Her father had beaten me now. It's about what works for you. Not Warren and me. You love her a lot. Have I told you that? That her father is called Warren. He is in the insurance as relatives. Alice Durand's phone is not moving. Maybe she's thrown it. - How did it last? - To a mast to the north. Do you know where she might want to go? I'll take it straight. Can you keep it here? - Yes? - Alice doesn't go home. She was heading north. - Do you know where she wants to go? - No. The sister's office. Maura. I'm texting the address for you. - I'll find the phone. - I'll take Maura. - Hold on. - Received. Drive. Well done. Good boy. Press there. Beautiful. You can wait outside. I am coming shortly. You can put yourself in the meantime. I do not want to anymore. - You keep Flynn fast. - That's not what we're doing here. Get close to the father, and Flynn is safe. Remember why you're here. Remember your task. I trusted you Flynn. I trusted you more than to myself. - But he was your lab rat. - No, it doesn't fit. I didn't know the whole story. I swear. I thought we observed stress. That I helped. - What have they done to him? - I do not know. I thought, we should save people. Pardon. He had a secret project and used blood tests. I didn't know more. You know what he did to me. I did not know it. I killed him for what he did to you. - Against Flynn. Towards our family. - You are lying. It was to protect yourself. That's how it was. It is over now. - Quite the end. - No. You ... - I'll arrest you. - No. - You killed a man! - He was a monster. - I don't regret it. - Throw it. Throw the gun! I love Nick and Flynn. It was a lie that became real. You know that. I fought for them with you. You know that. - Yes. - I can't see them. Flynn won't understand. They never forgive me. Come on. I love them. Please let me go. Come on. Satan. If you go now, You never get Flynn to look again. I know. Go. Go. - Take care of them. - Yes. What ...?! No! Alice! Stay with me! Come on. No no! Alice. Stay with me. It will be OK. Look at me. Stay with me, Alice. Talk to me. Say something. It will be OK. Call for help! Alice! Look at me! Suspects have been shot. Come on. I have you. You can do it. Alice!
