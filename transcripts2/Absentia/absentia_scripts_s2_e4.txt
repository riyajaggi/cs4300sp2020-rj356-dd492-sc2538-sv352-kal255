We never should have bumped him up from weather. Sibilant esses. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late. Why didn't you call me? You're the boss. Bosses are never Late. You heard the guy, "Nationwide manhunt." Who do you think's In charge of that thing? I ordered you pancakes. - No, I'm sorry, I don't have time. You're going to catch Tyler Brandon Mills today, huh? Nuh-uh-uh. No extra tips from me. Not even a little one? I promise you, when we catch the guy, you will get the exclusive. I already have the exclusive. Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go. Got a forty-year-old female. Abdominal trauma. Vitals are unstable. Call a trauma panel and... Thanks. I'll take it from here. Seriously, man? Dude, What is up with you? Canto, Where are we on Mills? They're running his photo on all the Channels. We have eyes on his parents, his apartment and we're watching his financials. Tips are pouring in, but nothing's solid yet. Anything real, come straight to me. Where are Durand and Gunnarsen? They're in the conference room. "The Hobbit". Were you expecting "Mein Kampf"? You two, I want updates in ten. Tyler Is smart. He likes fantasy, military history. The politics came later. After he was disqualified from the army. Yeah. He wanted to be the big man with the big gun. Couldn't pull it off. He has every iteration of video game consoles. Every first-person shooter. My son wants this stuff but my Wife's not having it. Smart woman. - Ha. Take a look at this. He has an admirer. Had an admirer. These are from 10 years ago. Liza Tutee. Was she on the list of friends and family? No, she's new. Day one with Byrne go all right? Yeah, she's sharp. Why? You expecting a problem? No. Before she, um... She was one of the best. Then Why are we having this conversation? Because I worry about her. Because she's my friend. Look, guys I served with in Iraq were broken by Less. And she's still here. Listen. You're uniquely qualified to recognize that she's struggling, so, keep an eye on her for me. Let me know if anything comes up. Okay. His pulse is thready. How much longer to the hospital? Still ten minutes out. There's no exit wound. Bullet's still inside. I'm gonna have to take it out. - You can't! Yeah, but if it embolizes, it'll go straight to his heart. Who even knows if an embolism will happen? I know it's unlikely, but still. Case Closed. All right? Apply pressure, give fluids and get his ass to a real doctor. That's our job. Jack? - Yeah, all right. You kill that, I kill you. There's no need for violence, we can brew some more. Sorry. This case is destroying me. I slept under my desk last night. Your nobody's case sounds Like a vacation right about now. You know Why they call the victims "nobodies"? No. So the rest of us can feel safe with only one killer in town. We're all nobodies, Canto. Hey. Hey. - What you working on? I've been looking into the fentanyl. I'm not getting anywhere tracking his supplier. Do you know you can get pure fentanyl online? Dark web. They mail it to you. Tiny packages. But none of the dealers wanna be known for It 'Cause it's bad for business, but it's not hard to come by. I mean, his MO's the same every time. It's Like he's not even trying to hide that it's him. But a fentanyl shot, it's Like using a cannon instead of a gun to do the job, right? Okay. Spit balling here. Let's go With the theory that the vice were easy targets Chosen at random, right? Valerie MCNair, she's practically a vagrant travelling alone. Farley's a sleazy Lawyer, door's always open. Rivera isolated himself by trying to start a turf war. So, if we start by looking at the vice and Where they were in the week leading up to... You know, before they died... No, no, no. Wait. Rivera wasn't an easy target. Why? - He was a part of a gang. He had a Glock in his waistband, he had a 22 in his sock. I mean... What if it's not just about, Like, random targets? What if, uh... What if they're actually connected? They're all In the system, right? - Farley wasn't. Yeah, but Farley worked for the system. Cal Isaac. Yeah. That's BPD. There's been another lethal injection. Who? - Congressman Eli Ramos. Not an easy target, is he? A congressman is a big leap from a bus-bench Lawyer. The party's next great hope. Yeah. And are those hives? Let's flag it and send it to the ME. So it's the same MO. - Mm-hmm. Our killer's precise. But Why is he Choosing all of these people? I mean look, wallet, fancy car keys. Right out in the open but the killer Left them behind. So it's not a robbery. He gets inside, he does his job and he gets out. Sounds like a professional Tony. Thanks. Hey, have the unis spoken to the neighbors? Yeah, they're canvassing right now. Ah, shit. You want me to bring the car around the back? No. We're good. Okay. Agent Byrne, What's it Like to be back? How did you get Clearance? - Officer, keep 'em back. Agent Byrne! - Clear the path. Get out of the way. Get out of the way! Can you handle this? I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I just didn't expect to be a part of this story. Byrne. Byrne. You alright? Yeah... I've... The autopsy reports are just... getting to me. I think I'm just gonna call It a day. Okay. Hey. Hey. What are you having? Vodka,neat - Mike, a vodka, neat. 80, um... What do you need? I wanted to see you. I don't Like how we Left things. Okay. Why did you call? I just wanted to hang out. Try to be normal, you know? Can we get out of here? Yeah, uh, okay. Um, uh... You don't want a drink first? Come on. - Sure. Wait. Are you okay? Shocking news as Congressman Eli Ramos was found dead in his home today. The Boston-born representative was only 42 years old. The FBI has declined to make any comment regarding the nature of his death. Asty!. Hey, Asty. Hey. What happened to that patient I brought in earlier? The GSW? Mm-hmm, uh, bullet embolism. They took him to surgery but he didn't make it. There was nothing we could do. Thank you. Hey, it's me. Hey. Hey. Is that your first or your fifth? Um... I shouldn't have called. I'm glad you did. So? Today was tough and... Well, when things get tough, I usually head to the bar. But you didn't get a drink. It's progress, not perfection. You know, that, um... That sounds Like program talk. Al-Anon, or actually, Alateen. Uh, y-your mom or your dad? Try both. Come on, I'll tell you about it over Lunch. You're buying. Okay. What have we got? Liza Tutee. 25.

Yet our killer took him down. How? He was a beast. Birthmark or rash? There's another one. Cal. Look at that. Looks Like a needle. Must have snapped off. Killer made a mistake. Clay fought back. - Mm-hmm. The killer'd have to be a big guy himself. Or a woman... using a different approach to get Close. You're 27. Hey. Hey. can we have a minute? -Sorry. Cal. Okay.
