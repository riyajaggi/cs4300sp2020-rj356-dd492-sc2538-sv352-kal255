 Where's the hacker you were working with? And what did she tell you? Just tell us where she is and this will all be over. Flynn. Hey. Talk to me. I wondered why Dad hadn't texted me back. Maybe he's off grid. I mean there could be... And what if he doesn't call? What if he's... Hey, hey, look at me. I want you to hear what I'm about to tell you, Flynn Warren Durand, okay? You might get a text message.

 You might see something on TV, someone's gonna tell you that something bad happened to your dad, but unless you hear it from me personally, you don't believe it. You got it? You can trust me. I believe he's alive and so should you. You're looking for him, too? Yeah. And I'm not gonna stop until I find him. I promise you. I love you, you know that? Me too. Everything's gonna be okay.

 Everything's gonna be okay. Thanks for coming in, Emily. Can I get you something? Coffee? Water?No. Thanks. I know it's been a rough 48 hours. Should you need anything, any kind of support, please don't hesitate to ask. Thanks. The FBI is your family. Deputy Director Webb and I want to assure you we're working around the clock to find those responsible for Nick's abduction and possible homicide. Julianne, you're not buying any of this, are you? I agree it's unlikely, but we have to let the evidence lead us to our conclusions. We don't operate on guesses and hunches. The explosion was a diversion. But Forensics have recovered numerous bone fragments from the scene. We believe this group may have burned the remains of their victims in the incinerator. Now, we're working around the clock to identify all the remains, and we're in the process of tracking down any leads to locate Nick and Dawkins, on the working theory they're still alive. Okay. Good. So, we've got a lot of work to do. Yes. We do. But not you. Now, it pains me to say this, Emily, but this is our investigation, not yours. Even if you were officially reinstated, being so close to Nick, I couldn't have you on board. Ju... I feel it's in everyone's best interest to have you sit this one out. I hope you understand. Julianne, I can help. Just use me. I'll do whatever. No, I'm sorry. I can't have any more stabbing victims on my watch. Take the time to take care of yourself and your son. We'll keep you posted on any developments. Anything new? Well, Dawkins is on Interpol's most wanted list. He's a transporter, seems he travels on forged passports and has multiple aliases, both here and in Europe. White male, 40 to 60. But absolutely nothing concrete on his actual identity. Damn it. I'll follow up with Interpol. Emily. Emily. Look, we all want to know what happened to Nick. We need to work together to bring him back. Yeah, does Gunnarsen know that? 'Cause she just fucking sidelined me.She's a bureaucrat. She's got no choice but to go by the book. Come on. Listen to me. I can keep you in the loop. If Gunnarsen finds out that you're helping me, your career is gonna be over. I can take care of myself. Now, I want Nick back and I think you're his best chance. So listen. The name of that guy you stabbed is Kristophe Scharfe. He's recovering from his wounds at Boston General. Now, Scharfe is scared. He would rather go to prison than cooperate with us. Thank you. Okay. I just want to chat. You make any noise and things are gonna get painful. Do you understand? Good. Shh. Quietly. Fuck you, you... Hey, everything okay in there? Yeah, everything's good. What do you want? I want you to get a message to Dawkins, you tell him that I have Kai and the files that she stole. I wanna make a trade for the life of Nick Durand. Today. By now, he knows who you are. He knows where you live. He'll find you soon enough. You tell him to meet me at Hadfield food court at three o'clock. I'm coming to make a deal, not to take him down. Fuck. Hey. You used to hang with Tommy Gibbs, right? Yeah. Why? He was a good guy. He was the best. You guys take care? Please, I need your help. My name is Nick Durand. I'm an... I'm an FBI agent. Can you tell me where I am? Can you at least tell me what day it is? How long have I been here? What do they... What do they want from me? If you... If you help me, the government will reward you. Hey. This is the patient for the MRI? Yeah. That's the one. Okay. So, I just need to verify a couple of things here. Your full name and your date of birth, sir. Kristophe Scharfe. August 10th, 1981. - That's all good. - Got it. Thanks, officer. You have a good day.You too. I'll be taking you downstairs, my friend. Um... Man, the hacker you're looking for, the crazy bitch who stabbed me, she's hiding her. And she wants to make a deal with the stolen files in exchange for the FBI agent you're holding. When? At three o'clock, Hadfield Mall food court. No, no, no, Kristophe, Kristophe. Stay there, you're injured. Just relax. Just take your time and breathe. Just breathe. Did she give you any more details? Information? She says she doesn't want you, just the agent. She's coming alone. Is that all you spoke about? Look, I didn't cooperate with the FBI. No, no, it's good. You've given me more information than your fallen companions. Now then, let me express my sincere gratitude for a job well done. Take it, baby. Easy. Take it, baby. Don't fight it. Let it go. An orderly tells the BPD officer he's taking Kristophe Scharfe in for X-rays. He wheels him into an empty room. And a few minutes later, he slips out while the officer is distracted. The officer then finds Kristophe Scharfe dead on an exam table. Using facial recognition, we've run an enhanced photo of the orderly against one from Interpol, and sure enough, it is Dawkins. Okay, send this picture to BPD and every other federal agency. I want this man found. We get Dawkins and hopefully that leads us to Nick. Good work. There's something else. I asked Canto and Thompson not to share this with the rest of the office. How long was she in there? Nearly five minutes. I told her to stand down. Yeah, and she has a habit of not taking orders. How the hell did she find Scharfe so quickly? I have no idea. Find her. I wanna know what Byrne and Scharfe discussed. If she refuses to share that information, bring her in. And at that point, if she still doesn't tell us, I'll have her arrested for obstructing our investigation. I took some food from the fridge. But before you get mad, I came right back down. Figured it'd be safer, you know, in the dark. I need those files. I'm not giving them to anyone. I need those files to get Nick back. What about me? They don't care about you. They just want the files that you stole. Well, the files are the only leverage I have and the reason I'm still alive. Okay, fine. Then let me take you to the FBI until all this shit is over. As soon as the FBI found out about me, everything went to hell. Meridian has eyes everywhere, okay? There's no way I'm going in. All right. Then, you stay here until we find Nick. And then when I get him back, we'll find someplace safe for you. Dawkins has Nick. I set up a meeting with him to exchange your files for his life. Are you crazy? You can't make a deal with these people.I don't exactly have a choice. You don't have a choice, but I do. Shit. Let me help you. No. Just... Just go get the alcohol over there. I can fix what I started. How? I... I give you proof I have Meridian's files. And if you can get me within 300 yards of Dawkins, I can tag his phone. You can follow him to where they're holding Nick and rescue him. I'm not taking you near a psychopath. None of this would have happened if I hadn't come to your house. I put your family in danger. Nick's one of the good guys. It's why I went to him for help in the first place. Emily, please. Let me fix what I started. I can stay in the car and stay totally out of sight. You go hide over there. Stay quiet. Hey, whoa. You put up a hell of a fight? Yeah. Did you expect anything less? No, of course not. So... Are you staying here, in this? No, I'm just here to pick up a few of Flynn's things. Okay. Poor kid. What are you doing here, Derek? Looking for you. In case you hadn't heard, Dawkins killed Kristophe Scharfe right after you visited him at the hospital. So... Do you wanna tell me what that was all about? What did you find, Emily? Nothing. I came away empty-handed. That's the truth. Yeah, look, I need transparency. Okay? Otherwise, you know, you can answer to Gunnarsen and she will have you arrested for obstruction. So, what? You're Gunnarsen's lapdog now, Derek? No. No, no, no. I jumped through hoops for you. Not her. And it cost me everything. And what did it cost me? I'm not going in, Derek. Then please give me something. Look, I care about Nick, too. You know, you're not the only one and you can't do this alone. You're hurt. I mean, come on. I need three hours. Please? I'll bring you back something. Just three hours. Okay. I guess I haven't found you. Yet. You got your three hours. But after that, I can't make any promises. Special Agent Canto. We're looking at additional surveillance footage around the warehouse. We've identified a black town car leaving the area. Yeah, she's here. In fact, I don't think Girl Scout's left the office since this whole thing broke. Sure. I can bring her along. But that means you're pulling us away from Nick's case. Yeah, I know where that is. We're on the way. Hey. What up? Crown just gave us a special assignment. All right. Okay, I'm trying to get online. Got anything yet? Emily, we got a problem. What? I can't get a signal in this parking garage. There's too much concrete. Shit. Get me closer. What? The tech store on the third floor. Emily, I don't need to be able to see Dawkins. I just need to get close enough to tag his phone. It's not gonna happen. Besides, it's too late to call this off. Trust me, Emily, I can do this. Fuck! Emily. Fine. But you stay out of sight, you got it? For sure. I found something from the Meridian files you can show Dawkins. One of their blackmail videos. Is it gonna be enough? Yeah. It should be. Okay, you stay in constant communication with me through the wire. Wow. Shit just got real. Just focus on tracking Dawkins and everything's gonna be okay. Hey. Look at me. Kai. Don't worry, I'll be close by. I promise. Okay. Okay. Kai. Thank you. Shit. Hey. Hey, I need your help. But it's gotta be now. Found Byrne. Got Canto and Thompson sticking to her. What? Call them off right now. Why? Emily's meeting Dawkins at the Hadfield Mall. She's got Nick's source stashed at the Tech Plus store. What? If Dawkins or the source see any surveillance, they'll get spooked. Where are you going? To back her up. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Julianne, I got a lead on Dawkins. I'm putting a team together. Crown, we lost her at the Hadfield Mall. Okay, roger that. Byrne's trying to meet Dawkins. She's got Durand's source with her. Holy shit balls. She's been hiding her this entire time?Yeah. Crown wants us to get eyes on them, but discretely. You look for the source, I'll take Dawkins. And stay invisible. Crown and backup are inbound. Are you ready? I've tapped into the mall's CCTV system. Ready when you are. I'll head for the food court. You get your eyes on the source at Tech Plus. On it. Got eyes on Dawkins. Watch for me. I see you walking towards him. Looks like he's alone. Ms. Byrne. Please, sit down. I suggest we call a detente. You have a gun. I have a gun. We're in a public place. Too many witnesses for either of us to do anything rash. And besides... There's little urchins running around. I've been looking forward to meeting you in person. I'm here to make a deal. That's good. So am I. Okay, I'm tapping into his phone right now. So, where is she? She's not here. Deal doesn't include her. Really? You see, my orders were to retrieve the stolen files and bring the hacker back to my employers. Alive. Did your orders include kidnapping Agent Durand? Of course. He was her FBI handler. Your employers don't need either of them. What they want is what she stole. This is a simple exchange. The files for Nick's life. And how exactly do you propose we do that? The two of us wait here together. Your people retrieve Nick. Once I know he's safe, we'll give you everything. Everything? I need proof of life, though, first. You drive a hard bargain. Okay, I'm on his phone. As you can see, he's alive. Um... Yep. It's a live feed. Tracking it now. Stall him, I need a minute. Trying to lock down Nick's location from the camera feed. He looks like he was beaten. Well, I'm afraid he didn't come willingly. It's your turn. Accessing the Meridian files. Getting something for you in five seconds. And here it comes, now. There you go. This is very interesting. A prime minister. Two women, not either of those are his wife. This appears to be part of what I've been sent to retrieve. I'm sure you'll appreciate that these files in the wrong hands could become weaponized. And I also really appreciate your clever outreach to try and settle this matter. I'm tracing that live feed. Something's... Not right. According to the signal's originating IP address... Nick isn't in Boston. Hey, you! He isn't even in the US. Hey! Stop! Escaped patient, requesting backup. He's... In Europe. Stop right there! You lied. Nick is nowhere near here. You're not the only one with a trick up your sleeve. It seems your friend is close by. What? I now have exactly what I came here for. And you have a bit of a dilemma. It's either me or your new friend. No. Kai. Get out of there. Kai, get out of there now! Going now. She's running. What do I do? Stay on her. I'm here. On Dawkins. Food court, third floor. I'm on the source. Shit. Thompson? Yeah, I'm on her. Shit. I've got eyes on Dawkins heading down to the ground floor on the west side escalator. I'm on him. Kai, talk to me. Where are you?See me, you see me. Where are you? Escalators. I'm coming for you right now. Shit! Out of the way. Out of the way. Kai, talk to me! We are on site. What's your location? - Central Rotunda. - Copy. Let's move. Okay! Go, go, go! FBI! Freeze right there! Freeze right there! Somebody call 911! No. Kai! No! Kai! Shit. Lost Dawkins. He's gone. Fuck! Kai? Kai! Kai? Kai, I'm here. I'm here. Hey. Come on, honey. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Look at me. You got it, just breathe. Just breathe. You look at me. Look at me. You're okay. Look at me. You're gonna be okay. There's an ambulance coming, all right? We got this, okay? You just stay strong. - You're okay. - Emily. Dawkins is gone. You're gonna be fine. Just stay with me. You stay strong. Get these people out of here.You stay strong. There you go, baby. There you go. You got it.
