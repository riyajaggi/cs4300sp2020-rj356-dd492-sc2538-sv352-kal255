 - Alice, what is this? - I'm pregnant. Our whole life together, it's just a consolation, isn't it? I'm going to my sister's. Stand by, we're receiving body cam footage from the Nottingham Park gravesite. We need to talk about Jack. - He always been violent? - I don't judge. Did he ever take you out to a cabin on I95? Emily Byrne is here! Jack, I'm hurt. I just want to see you one more time. Jack... Please. The FBI in tandem with Boston Police and New Hampshire State Police

 recovered six bodies from a wooded area in New Hampshire. Remains are in advanced stages of decomposition. The identities of the victims will be released pending DNA results. Is Emily Byrne connected to these bodies? No comment. My source tells me that Emily Byrne lead you to the mass grave. Is this part of the killing spree? Miss Byrne is wanted for the murder of Special Agent Adam Radford. There is a $250,000 reward being offered in connection with that murder. - That concludes the questions. Now... - Detective Gibbs, what about the shooting last night? Any truth to reports Byrne is involved, fatally wounded? - No comment. - What's your working theory - on why she came back to Boston? - No comment on Emily Byrne, no matter how many times you ask. Thank you. Where are we? We're in a motel. I got the bullet out. Stitched you up. There's no major internal damage. I spoke to Violet. I know you've been asking about me. Why? I saw some stuff on your computer. What stuff? There were videos of women being tortured. - My private life is none of your business. - Water... - drowning... - You know, the whole world - thinks you're a serial killer. - Folders with girls' names, all flowers. What exactly are you accusing me of? - Did you do it? - Did I do what? What? You think I had anything to do with your kidnapping? - I'm not sure. - You're not sure? What about the absences when I went away? I was in rehab! Twice! Trying to dig myself out of the whole I fell in after you were taken. The only way I could deal with my life turning to shit! - I didn't realize it. - No, of course you didn't! And what about some fucking gratitude? I could have left you to die out there, - I could have turned you in. - And why didn't you? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? You broke into my apartment, you snooped around on my computer, you followed me, you had people ask about me. I didn't break into your apartment just to spy on you. - I swear. - Then why did you? - I just... I needed your help. - With what? I had... I had something in my hand at the cemetery. I was trying to... Was it this? - Yeah. - A pacemaker? - I found that on a dead body. - A dead body? That's what I needed your help for. That's the key to finding who had me, Jack. I need your help, please. You know? I could go to jail for what I've already done for you so far, Em, so, if I'm gonna break any more laws for you, you better start telling me the whole truth. - I am telling you the whole... truth. - Bullshit! What about the others? Who are they? - What others? - They found six bodies in those woods, Em. Six! And you knew they were there. How?! What did you do to them? What's going on? Stop! Get up. Flynn, get up. What's going on? - Flynn! - He said Mom's a killer! - He said Mom's dead. - And you're just like her, freak! - Get away from me! - The cops are gonna get her - and put a bullet in her head! - Get outta here! What's going on? - Leave me alone! - Hey, Flynn! - Hey! - Flynn Durand, downstairs! Kitchen, now! Sit there. Let me clean that scrape. How's Mom? As soon as the police hear anything they'll tell your father. In the meantime, we need to stay calm. - And hope that she's okay. - I know Mom's alive! Everyone said she was dead before. But they were wrong. She'll come back this time too. Yeah, well, that's... - that's what we're praying for. - You don't believe it either, all the stuff they're saying about her. No. No, I... I know her. She's a good person. And she's a good mother. She wouldn't do anything that would hurt her chances of being with you. Okay? Come. I know things are tough now, okay? And I know they're confusing, but, I love you. We all love you. We're gonna figure it out. Okay? Go change your clothes, honey. Come home. Please. For Flynn's sake, for... for my sake. - We need to be together now. - No. I meant what I said. End this, Nick... and then we'll talk about the future. Okay, okay, okay, okay. So let's say I get all of that, which... I don't. The visions, the body, all of it... How does the pacemaker fit in? Whoever is tied to the pacemaker... is someone who is connected to my childhood and to my captive. But, you don't have any proof of that, Em. That's why I needed you to track down the name, you understand? It's all connected. - Harlow, the tree, Barrett House... - None of this is making any sense, Em. - Then help me make sense. - I'm trying! - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Let me see. - No. Let me see. Come on, move your arm. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna need to redress this. You're gonna have to lay down. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - I got you. I got you. All right. Yeah. Jack. Thank you. Em, I sent the cops to those woods. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, it was an accident, it just... It's okay. I'll get you the name. But first let me get you the gauze. So, Emily's been investigating Semerov all those years... and now Jack is connected to one of his girls? I don't like it. Maybe Emily doesn't like it either. Because she thinks he's the one who had her in the cabin. The question is "do we"? Two days ago I would have said "yes". You know, it was a person of interest. But now, going AWOL like this, knowing that we have his laptop, digging around his Dungeon Porn collection... I'm liking him for this. Then, let's step up our game and find him, or Emily, either one, Tommy. You saw the blood in the alleyway. - She couldn't have gone far without... - We're looking everywhere. The FBI hotline is definitely not helping this. We got like a hundred bogus tips an hour. This reward, it's killing us. She's a walking lotto. But look, Tommy, I think we're missing something here. She needs medical attention. Jack Byrne used to be a doctor. Yeah. Yeah! Em. I just got his. What should I do? - Call him. - Yeah. Use a burner. Keep it under 2 minutes. And then we have to power it off right after. See if you can find anything out about the bodies too. Okay, it's ringing. Agent Durand. Nick. Hey, it's Jack. Um, did you find her? Yeah. Um, no. No, we didn't get her. Thanks for calling back so fast. What number is this? I got a new phone. The damn reporters kept calling me. Um, so what's going on? I saw the news. All those bodies in the woods, I mean... Jesus. Yeah. Look, um... she was shot. She might need medical attention. She might... she might reach out to you. Well, if she does I'll call you. Yeah, thanks. Are you at home now? Yeah, why? Gotta I swing by in a bit, talk about some things that could help with the case. I'm headed in the direction anyway. Alice took Flynn to Mora's for a few days. Yeah, sure. But if I'm not there, then I'm running some errands. Thanks, Jack. Wow, this is, um... - it's a mess. I don't really... - Nick, I gotta go. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, listen, I need to... Is that okay? Great. Sorry, he was using a burner and the call was too short. Well, we've caught him in a lie. He said he was home. We've got uniforms there now. It's empty. I'm sending you a file from our techs, you wanna read it ASAP. Yeah. Okay, thanks. You two are brothersinlaw, you never got a vibe off Jack? Never. He was a doctor. Ivy League. It's not like if we went to barbecues and ball game together. He and Emily were never close. Just when Jack Byrne was starting to look like our guy. Our techs just went through the hard drives at Semerov's club. Jack was listed as a customer. And his payments sync up perfectly with those withdrawals from the secret account. He never used the money to fund the cabin setup. Well, we don't know if she knows that. She's with him, I'm telling you. I could tell it by his voice. She could've snatched him up thinking he was the one. We gotta find them. - Hey. - Hey. Come and check this out. I found a name. - Okay. You go. - You were right, there is a connection. Doctor LuFang Shen, MIT. Behavioral scientist. - The name means nothing to me. - Here, look at the next tab. Here. My God. Barrett House. Yeah, your orphanage. Dr. Shen was administrator there. He started there after you left. Went missing 16 years ago, was declared dead after 10. Okay, we gotta find someone we can talk to. There. He's got a brother. Erik Shen. Owns a restaurant in Chinatown and... still open. What did the hotel do with my stuff? Dad didn't have room, it's in the truck of my car. - Can you get me a duffle bag? - Yeah, of course. Excuse me, is Mr. Shen here? - Just a moment. - Thank you. Erik Shen? Yeah. I'm... Special Agent Parker, FBI. I was hoping to discuss your brother's disappearance. That was many years ago. I have no interest in discussing it. We have a new lead. No, I'm sorry. This is behind me. I don't need to know anything. Somebody came forward. Mama! I don't remember much about LuFang's work. Only that... it was controversial. He said that was why MIT dismissed him. Yeah, but the orphanage job just seems like an odd choice. I never understood that move. But the work gave him purpose. It gave him joy working with those children. Did he ever talk to you about his work? No. But he was always with those children. Either there, or he would sign them out on weekends, take them to museums, zoo, planetarium... Was he married? Any kind of romantic relationships? He was married for a short time. His wife died. I never really got to know her. LuFang was... always a bit strange. Did you keep any of his things? In his will he left all his research to the Boston Athenæum. But my wife never got around to it. It's in storage. I can give you the key. Thank you. My name's Jack and I'm an alcoholic. Hello, Jack. I'm here because my... friend had a medical emergency, and I needed to step up. It's been four years since I last operated. But it was someone I care about on my table. I picked up the scalpel... all I could think was... I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. "I need a shot", you know. "You know, a shot will calm my nerves and if..." and if one is good, then two's better, right? "I'll be steady as a rock." But then I remembered why I lost my license in the first place. I stepped up. I didn't take the drink. Okay. And I saved someone I care about. I felt like I've been given a second chance. This is the first day of my sobriety. Jack Byrne. What's this about? I need you to come with me. You've been given placebos that informed the side effects but... The final phase will use two subjects, A and B. Get inside the tank. No, I don't want to. But one of you must do the experiment today. - Who will it be? - Nobody. Someone must. You may choose. Why? What did we do wrong? Nothing. This is special work. You are part of something very special. - We wanna leave. - Okay. Then, I will choose. No, please! Don't make me! Don't! God, don't make me! Please! Don't make me! Don't make me, Dr. Shen! We know you came to your sister's aid. Her blood was in your car. Nice try. There's no proof when she was in my client's car. Here's what I'm trying to understand, Jack... you helped us track her down, now you're willing to go to jail for her? What changed? Look, I get it. I get it. She got shot, this was life and death... The kind of thing you put differences aside for. That's why you helped her. Work with me here a little bit. I don't know what you're talking about. She almost got away from us, thought we lost her. How long do we have to hold her? We have to find a cop, bring her in, get that reward money. Okay. Okay. You couldn't have done it without me. I killed 6 people, maybe more! - Yeah? Fuck you and your van! - And fuck you too! - What did you say? - Nothing. Nothing. Let's move forward. Hey, you heard that? - Hear what? - Stop the car. - Are you hearing...? - Shh! Fuck off! Come on, man. Let's get our money before she wakes up. - Come on, let's go. Let's go! - All right. I'm going. I'm going. Damn it! Front light's off.! Look at the road, you're gonna get us killed! I don't want to die before I get rich! - Come on, let me drive. - No fucking way, it's my ride! My God. Are you all right? Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Hey, my car! She stole my car! She stole my car! Shit! You tied her, man! If he gets us something, he can walk out of here. How did she contact you? When did you pick her up? Did she say anything about those woods? Those bodies, those graves? Come on. We found six bodies over there, Jack. She didn't do it. Did you? What? Let's see... Then you're fired from the hospital, secret bank account, connections to Semerov... Think I don't know what you're doing here? You think I can't see through this? You're trying to pump me for information, then you are just gonna... twist it and turn it, and use it however you want against her. So, no. I have nothing for you. And I got these for you. Jack Byrne, you're under arrest for harboring a wanted fugitive. How is your boy? He's confused about Emily. I don't know what to tell him. - They're resilient. - Yeah. Maybe all the signs were there, and I just missed them, you know. What signs? The way she would get... when she wanted something and she didn't... get it. She'd snap. Well, now you're describing my exwife. Wife number one, two or three? Touché. How did it make you feel? I couldn't breathe. I was swallowing water. I thought I was gonna die. Why are you doing this to us? To see how you adapt your surroundings over time. I hate it! The only way to stop it, is to do the experiment on someone else. That means you will be in charge of adding the water to the tank. No, no, please! Please, no! Please don't do this to me. I don't want to do this. Please! I don't want to do this! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Easy! Easy, Charles! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Easy! Easy, Charles! Cut it out, Charles! Hi, this is Alice. Leave a message. Hey... hey it's me, um... Give me a call back when you get this. It's... I just wanted to give a heads up, I'm on my way over. I won't stay long. Goodbye. Alice! Hey, baby. It's me. I just wanted to call to tell you that, um... I'm still alive and... I love you. And we'll be together soon, okay? Transcribed & synced by kinglouisxx & chamallow.
