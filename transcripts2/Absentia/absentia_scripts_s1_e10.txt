 Previously on Absentia... Where is she?! Where is my wife?! The serial killer's macabre signature: Removing the eyelids of his victim. - Hello, Nick. - Harlow? - How the hell are you calling me? - Nick. She's alive. - How long? - You've been gone six years. Emily, you and I have both been victimized by the same person. - How did you do it? - You can see that look in your eyes, we both have it.

 They found my DNA on Semerov's body and now Harlow is dead? BPD has issued a warrant for you. - I have to take you in. - Where are you? I'm gonna solve this. Why do you have my visions in your journal? The bleeding eye was the only clue I could never make sense of. It's not a person, it's a place. It's someone who is connected to my childhood and to my captor. - Did Dr. Shen hurt you? - Yeah. Your friend? Did your friend hurt Dr. Shen back? That's the mask Emily drew. The children who saw these masks

 had the idea way before Harlow ever got involved. I found a company called "TriKing". I think they made the tank that held me. I need to find out who ordered it and where it was sent. Our whole life together, it's just a consolation, isn't it? I'm going to my sister's. Alice! My family has been taken from me. Emily, I know you're hurting... but I beg of you, please bring them home. Nick, I'm not far from the cabin. Whoever planned this has eyes. I need you to come alone.

I saw him on a call about... half an hour ago, and then he was gone. Damn it! You think he's still close by? Probably. Maybe. I think I have a good lead near you. Old employee from Barrett House. Okay, I'll take the lead. You take down the boy. She has a bunch of old files in her attic. - Maybe there's something we can use. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Good. Alice, wake up. Alice, you've gotta wake up. Up and at them, Agent. This is your second chance. Life doesn't give us second chances too often. Make the most of it. Where's Flynn? Who are you? I am you. What do you want? I want to show you what you are. Do you remember the first life you destroyed? You were just a child. But it came so naturally to you. "Child exhibits violent urges." "Impulsivity. Aggression." "Stimulationseeking behavior." "Does not respond to typical disciplinary measures." "Child appears to fit in with others, but displays little affection." "Rarely or minimally seeks comfort from others." "Possible attachment disorder." "Low probability of adoptive success." Nobody wanted you. Too troubled. Too flawed. So you did something about it. You took someone else's life. My life. All these years I've wondered why. - Why Dr. Shen chose me? - - Why me? Shen was looking for a profile. A very specific profile. - You had what he was looking for. - . You gave me your life, Emily. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Tonight, I finish giving it back. Please, let them go. Flynn's not a part of this. Flynn is a part of this. I was his age when Dr. Shen chose me. He transferred in right after you left. He would sign us out... weekend trips... the museum, the zoo. But they would always end up at his special place. He promised he'd kill us if we told anyone. Who could we tell? We had no one. He had the power. For six years, he tortured us. You can take it off now, Logan. You can take it off. You see, Shen believed children who survived early traumas like yours, and weren't crushed by it, could be forged into killer soldiers. Clinical. Dispassionate. Weapons that could be turned on and off, like a switch. Charles was the control subject and... I was supposed to be a perfect killer. Controllable. One who followed orders. A good soldier. But we were both failed experiments, Charles and I. - We're not taking any lives today... - . You. So, you're not the only one who can start a new life, Emily. I mean, you'd think that I'd go crazy, but I didn't. And it just made me stronger. Charles and I, we found out where Shen was, and we took care of him. He's not gonna bother us anymore. Shen's work was brilliant, no doubt, but it was flawed. He was an amateur. And I had a lot more money. Harlow made that comfortable. I couldn't have asked for a more willing partner. Six years, breaking you down and taking everything away from you. Recreating you and setting you free, to watch your life crumble around you, once and for all. It all went beautifully. Nothing would have been more satisfying than to see you kill your husband's new wife and show the world the truth about Emily Byrne. Sadly, I watched as you did nothing. Shen would have been so surprised to learn that all his work could be undone by a mother's love for her child. Tell me what you want. I'll do anything. I'll turn myself in, I'll confess to murder, please, just let Flynn go. You will confess to murder, Emily, you committed it. You killed Harlow. You killed Robert Semerov. You killed Semerov right there in that room. I didn't do it. You killed Harlow to frame me, just like you killed Semerov and Radford. Well, you're right about one thing. I did kill Radford. You left me no choice. But now, it ends. The way it should have. Mom! No. Please, no. But you can save him. No. Kill Alice. Please, no! No! Go on. Do it. Kill her. Show yourself who you really are. Kill her. - Emily! Emily don't do it! - Stop it, Nick, - it's not me. - Get away! What is this? - I gotta go. I gotta go outta here, please! - No! Don't move, stand back! - Nick, look it's... - I swear to God... Look behind you. - Just look behind you, please! - Don't move! Stay there! Mom! What is this? - What is this? What is this? - What? - No! - What have you done to my son? Where is he, Emily? - Please... Stop it, Nick, it's not me. - Where is my son?! You're gonna tell me where my son is. - Tell me where my son is. - Alice? Alice?! I know where he is. I know where he is. - Just step forward, slowly. - Okay. Alice?! Nick, we gotta be careful, she's still out there. Your ideas suck! Stop it! Yeah. Okay. Crown?! We got a triangulation on Durand's cell. Okay, gather round, people. I don't believe this. Goddammit, he's at the cabin. Okay, let's go. I want a team ready in five. Let's go! Face forward. Face forward! Stop. Are you okay? It's okay. It's... That door! Fast! - The lock. Just pull it out. - Mom! Emily, go away! Emily, get outta the away! Get the lock! Get the lock! Stand up. Move! Move! Nick. Out! You're okay, buddy. You're okay. Come on. Come on. That's it. Slowly. Slowly! Come. Come! Are you okay? Get down! Get down. Get down! Run! Go. Go! Come on. Go this way. Here it is. Here it is. Come on, Flynn! See the car? - No. - Go straight. Go straight Alice. Alice, get in the driver's seat. - What? - Start driving south. - What about you? - I have to go back. - No, Nick. - Dad! Dad, don't go! Get in the car. I got Staties on the line. This is Crown. I want a perimeter at the access road. No one in or out. Do not advance. Repeat, do not advance until we know the situation. Am I clear? You got that? Great. Look what they've done to us. What? No! The six bodies recovered in the forest were the victims of Conrad Harlow and Laurie Colson. These two serial killers - - operated together. - . Emily Byrne has been cleared of any involvement in those murders, as well as those of Robert Semerov, Conrad Harlow and Special Agent Adam Radford. Ms. Colson committed those murders. She was killed 2 days ago by Emily Byrne in an act of selfdefense. Thank you very much. So, Logan Brandt killed Shen as revenge for the experiments. Can't say I blame her. Then she digs into his files, finds out about the switch, that leads her to Emily. She dedicates her life to revenge... reinvents herself as Laurie Colson, and in Harlow she finds the perfect partner. He hated Emily. Match made in heaven. Leopold and Loeb. What'd you find in those old Barrett House files? Nothing. We're looking for more kids that Shen might have targeted. - You comfortable? - Yeah. Okay. Then get to it. Hey. Hey. You're here. Yeah. How do you feel? Not much. You? Same. Sorry I doubted you. I almost got you killed. But I should've believed you all along. I hope you forgive me. Nick, in the hotel room... I didn't know if I was gonna see you again. - And I just wanted to relive it. - I did too. But, um... I'm not the same. I mean, we're both not the same. And things are different now. I know. You know, Alice is good for you. Yeah. Alice is pregnant. Congratulations. Yeah. This is good. We needed this. Yeah. We did. I bet I put people through a lot. Stop. You did what you had to do in order to survive. I know who you are... and I know how far you've come. Even what you did as a child, it's what you had to do. But now it's time to move on, because that's what survivors do. What is that? - Ma, check this out. - That is amazing. I bet your Uncle Jack got that one for you? - Yeah. - I love it. Happy birthday, baby. Thank you. Why don't you go show it to Alice and your dad? Sure. - Dad, you want anything to drink? - I'll have a beer. Okay, I'll go get it. I told you I was the second type of cop. Yes. I'm glad you are. I believed you were innocent. So, um... what now? Crown asked me if I wanted back in the Bureau. And? And I think I'm gonna do it. But I... I need a little bit of time first, you know. Maybe I'll go... climb a mountain or something. Yeah, you sh... you... you should. So, um... wwhenever you are at... back at ground level, and if you ever need any help from... Boston's finest... yeah... come look for me. Thanks. Yeah. - Thank you for the beer. - You're welcome.
