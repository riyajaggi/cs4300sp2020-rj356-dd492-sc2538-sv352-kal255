 Previously on "Absentia"... Conrad Harlow. Killed that fed Emily Byrne a while back. - You think the wrong man's in jail? - This is a copycat. She's alive. - How long? - You've been gone 6 years. I can't be around you, or her, without feeling like I'm betraying someone. I've just got this blank space where my memory should be... and this rage that I can't control. Emily! Emily. - Could Emily have killed Semerov? - No.

 A fed. A crooked fed... out of the Boston office. If you could see that look in your eyes. We both have it. Stabbing victim, possible DOA, at 721 South Brooklyn. Tell me about the vision. The vision is getting worse. It's like it consumes me. And part of me just wants to forget it, and then the other part just wants to remember. And I'm terrified of what would happen if I ever do. It's just like I'm far away, just... looking at myself. Watching her, Emily... doing things. Does this make any sense?

 Complete sense. You have to be patient with yourself. What you're doing is not easy, Emily. You're trying. You should be proud of it. He ordered an escort at... 11:46 p.m. She arrives just before 02:00... Notice the body. Multiple stab wounds. Happened right here. A knife? From his own set in the kitchen. Missing. - Security cam? - Someone cut them off at 11:58. Well, Tommy, you finally got your big one. You might wanna clean up your act. You're not undercover anymore. Not your jurisdiction, Feeb. You're not the only Boston police I know, Gibbs. So you're here to talk about your exwife? She didn't do this. Do you got an alibi? I dropped her off at home, her alibi is gonna be that she was sleeping. - Couldn't you just say "no"? - I know this doesn't look good. That's an understatement. Weren't you looking for Semerov at first too. You looked into any witness yet, Kelly Price? You mean Regina Talbot. 'Cause matter of fact, I did. Looks like she skipped town. Someone is covering the tracks, Gibbs. Someone is trying to frame Emily. Well, you know as well as I do, or you wouldn't be here. And it's just a matter of time before this lands on Emily. Unless there's some overwhelming evidence that... There is... there is one more thing and it's not evidence exactly. What is it? What? There's a crooked agent, in the Boston FBI field office. That's who turned Regina Talbot into Kelly Price. And that person is afraid that Emily is onto them. You're reaching. Yeah, mmaybe... maybe, but I'm narrowing it down. If you could just buy me some time on your end. Please. Please, um... I need you to keep BPD off Emily. Make sure your girl doesn't leave town. They found my DNA on Semerov's body and now Harlow is dead? - After I broke into his house? - All right. Calm... calm down. Were you supposed to bring me in? - Is that why you're here? - They have circumstantial case at best. You hate him, you confronted him. That doesn't prove beyond reasonable doubt that you killed him. You're not going down for this. Not if... Not if we turn up another suspect. The agent who set me up for Semerov, that's who's behind this. That's who killed Harlow. What am I gonna do? What are we gonna do? We stay focused. We find the crooked agent behind Kelly Price. - You don't have an alibi, do you? - No. I got those burners. We should start using these from now on. Wait, wait. I'm not going with you? Well, you're gonna take Flynn, go karting as planned... You can pick him up from swim practice. Just me and him? We were supposed to go together. It's okay. You'll be fine. Look, Nick... Why do you trust me? I know you. I'm gonna take care of this. All right? Hey. So, It's just you and me... today. Your dad told you? - The coach told me. - Okay. It should be fine, right? Where are we going? It's a surprise. Come on. Okay. You're ready to go? Okay, close your eyes. Here we go. Here you go. How's the... All right? Ready? Let me take a look at this. How does that feel? Feels all right? Okay. - Hey. - It was awesome! - Yeah, you were great. Good job. - I wanna go again. - Yeah, okay. - Do you wanna come with me? - Yes. - I'll get your helmet. - Hey, Ericson... - Yeah? Can you tell me how Crown could file a report from the office at 10 p.m. when he left at 8? Yeah, sure, it's no big deal. He asked me to cover for him. - Hey, you got a minute? - What's up? I just wanna ask you about the other night, you left early. What about it? You were clocked in but you weren't here. Where were you? It's none of your business. You're seriously asking, aren't you? Fine, okay... You really need to know? I may have left early to meet a girl, okay? But if you saw what she looked like, Nick... So that's it, you... You were with a girl? What else would it be? I took her to Freddy's. - What was that... - Is Emily okay? I'm just trying to get home. I have nothing to say. Please, respect my privacy. Any information on the case? I've nothing to say. Please. Please, no comment! Please! Emily! What are you thinking? Hello? What happened to you? When you were gone. Did they hurt you? I don't remember much. But I do remember thinking about you. That allowed me to go through it. The rest of it doesn't matter. Okay? Here you go. Yes, thank you. You ready to do this? Yeah? Let's go. - You ready? - Yeah. Let's go! Whoo! Whoooo! Come on, Flynn! Whoo! Good job, honey. Good job. - That was cool. - Yes? You're cool. - One more time round? - All right, one more. - Three more? - Yeah, nice try. I have to get you home. One. Two? All right. You ready? This time race for real. Get ready, buster. Yeah! Come on! No! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! My God! Baby, my love! Baby... No! Let go! Let go! Baby, just... call for help! Do you hear me? Baby, come on. Can you hear me? What happened? I... He just... He came out of nowhere. - Does he have any previous head injuries? - II don't know. - Are you a relative? - Yeah, I'm his mom. - You have to stay here, okay? - Yes. - You have to... You have to stay here. - Okay. Hey, honey. Can I call you back in a sec? What? He... He's okay? Miss Byrne... We ran some tests just to be sure, but the results won't be ready for another few minutes. He's stable. He's got a little dizziness. However, he's... - Is Flynn okay? - Excuse me, who are you? - I'm his mother. - I thought you were his mother. She is. Is he okay? - He suffered a mild TBI, but... - Is he okay? There are no signs the concussion caused any lasting damage. However, there are some symptoms to look for, just... just to be sure. - Can we see him first? - Of course. I'll get one of the nurses to take you in and I'll check in after. What happened? You can see him now, if you'd like. Hey. Look at you. - How's your head? - It's getting better. - Is it? - That's great. I think we're gonna, um... take a break on racing for a little while. How's that? Yeah. Hey. Hey. - Hey. - Hey, Dad. How you feeling? - I drove real fast today. - Yeah... Yeah, I heard. We need you to take it easy for a little bit, okay? - Okay. - Yeah. Thank you. For? For being so patient with her. It's not her fault. It's yours. You were supposed to be there. She should never have been alone with him to begin with. It would've happened with me there too. These things happen. They didn't have before. You didn't ask me if it was okay. You didn't even let me know. And when I got that call... Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. He's okay. He... He's okay. - Next time I will... - Next time? We will talk about this, but right now I have to go. What? Now? You can't just take off. - I have to. - What could possibly be so... Harlow was killed this morning. They like Emily for it. Wait, they think she murdered someone and you left her alone with Flynn? And now you're leaving us alone to help her? - Of course she didn't do it. - How do you know? - Were you with her? - What? No, no, no, no. Help me, Nick. I'm trying to understand. I'm really trying. Right now, I have to go and do my job. And I need you to be okay with it. Hey. You know how much I love you. Hey. I'm sorry. He's gonna be okay. Listen. I have some leads. - I think it could be Crown. - Are you sure? I don't know. There's too many variables. We'll have to check his alibi. So, we check alibis one by one? I don't have that kind of time. I know, but I don't know what else we can do. We should go back to Harlow's place, we should see if there's anything there that links up to one of the agents. We don't have jurisdiction over the Harlow crime scene. So what's our option? The only way this goes down, is if I'm with you. You don't break rules, Nick. It's not who you are. So don't start now. I'll text you. I'm coming with you. Any news on the Harlow case? Still crossing our t's. This guy had a lot of enemies. Cross them faster. I'm getting pressure from on high to make an arrest, and they love the idea of it being a fed. If we arrest Byrne, then we got to be certain. I'm not yet. Are you? No one in this department thinks she's innocent. Doesn't make her guilty. Not all murderers look like one, Tommy. Watch out. There is nothing. Nothing. We have to move. We have to move. Come on. They're gone. Send me the pics, I'll run 'em through. Jack? You're home? Hey. Hey. What are you looking at? Nah, just chasing down a... soft lead and get nowhere. I just confirmed Cooper couldn't have had Emily in the cabin. He was in a Mexican jail for a year. Got out after Emily was released. That's good. You got any more questions you want to ask me, Nick? No. I'm cool. You? All right, so you're gonna stand there judging me all night, or you gonna actually say something? You're drunk. Judgment it is. I'm worried, Jack. - There's difference. - Is there? Is there really, Em? - I'm just trying to help. - And how... exactly are you trying to help, Em? Because it seems to me like all I'm doing is to cleaning up your messes! - Jack, what were you... - No. No! It's my turn to talk now, okay? You have no idea what's been like, Em. No idea. Do you think you have the monopoly on pain? I've been here, everyday, in the real word, taking care of Dad, trying to keep the lights on. Do you have any idea the damage you've caused? No, of course you don't. Because you're the same as you always were, the goddamn Emily show, from the day you were adopted. And you know what really gets me? Do you know what... really gets me? It's that just as life was starting to become bearable again... you had to come back. You're such an asshole when you drink, you know that? Yeah? Well, cheers. Fuck you! Where are you? I just checked into a hotel. You get a match? Then text me the address, I'm on my way. No, Nick, talk to me. Just text me the address. Hey, come in. - It's Adam. - What? He's the one behind Regina Talbot. Shit. I have to... I have to take this. - Yeah? - Nick, you gotta bring Emily in right now. We have new evidence. And it's bad. I'm... I'm really close to something, all right? If you could give me a little time. We have a video of her in the vacinity of Harlow's house, again. Just minutes before the murder. What? That's impossible. - Are you sure? - Ask to her. Ask her to look you in the eye and tell you she wasn't there. Bring her in or I will. What? What happened? You want to tell me? Where were you that night? I said, where were you? You want... you want help? You were at Harlow's house... again? I can explain. You lied to me! You have any idea how bad is this? I didn't do it. Please, Nick, I can explain. You think I'm an idiot? Do you think you can play me because I feel like shit that I never found you? No, I didn't kill him. Just listen to me for a second. Where did you go? I didn't go to Harlow's. Emily, stop telling me what you want. Tell me where you were or I'm walking out that door. I wanted to see what it was like. Your life. What should have been my life. What are you talking about? Last night, when Riggs started barking at something outside. It was me. I was there. Hiding. Just... watching you with her... with Flynn. You guys are so beautiful together. All of you. I couldn't... I couldn't stop looking. It's like that movie where the angel takes the guy and shows him what life would be like without him. And everybody is so much worse off. Except in my case it's the opposite. I believe you, I do. Adam, um... Adam doesn't know... what we know. I'm gonna get him talking, um... I'm gonna see what shakes out of him. - You have to be careful, okay? - I will. Does Jack or your father know where you are? No. Don't leave this room. Listen to me, Gibbs. This is the mother of my child that we're talking about. She's just saying her goodbyes. That's it. You have my word. One hour. Look, I have to go. What are you doing here? I was just on with BPD. They said they've arranged for you to bring Emily here. Yeah, I... I just want to talk first. Do you have a minute? Sure. Sure. You see the CCTV? No, they told me about it. Here, sit. You think she did it? It kills me but yes, I do. Emily shared something with me. A theory she had back before she was taken. Really? What's that? That's all kind of crazy to me, to be honest. But it's stuck with me. It wouldn't stop bothering me, you know. I think I know where this is going. Is this Emily's crooked agent theory? Yes, it is, actually. I knew she suspected someone from way back on the Semerov case. Hell, I did too for a moment. But I checked it out, I checked everybody out. There was no crooked agent. Were you ever at Harlow's place? Nick, you're a good agent... and a friend. And I understand why you have a blindspot for your exwife. Please answer the question, Adam. Yes, I was there yesterday. Had a question for Harlow whether his accomplice was Emily. It's not a secret. What is it you think, Nick? That I killed Harlow to frame Emily? Or could it be that... all the evidence against her is just that... Evidence. Do you know Kelly Price? She also went by Regina Talbot. I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this... but I care to much about you to see you risk your career or whatever else on Emily's desperate theories. And I can only imagine... the kind of stress you've been under. And that is why I'm gonna let this whole misguided conversation slide. Don't you have somewhere to be? You're right. I haven't been thinking. It must be the stress. You're lucky I'm understanding, Nick. This is a second chance I'm giving you. Life doesn't give a second chance too often. What?
