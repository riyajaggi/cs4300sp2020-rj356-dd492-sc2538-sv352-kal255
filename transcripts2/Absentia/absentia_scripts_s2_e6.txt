 There's something in this case that connects to me, and I need to figure out  what it is. You're not gonna get very far freezing out everyone who can help. I believe in you. I'm here if you wanna talk. Works both ways. Rex Wolfe. -So, how do we find him? I'm not sure we can. He could be anywhere. Okay, Mills is on his way up from holding. Let's do this. Hold still. Go, go, go! Don't move. - On the ground, agent. We just got word from the State Department that Rex Wolfe has fled the country.

 Apparently he's just crossed into Moldova from Ukraine. As far as the American public are concerned. Rex Wolfe does not exist. This is now your case. You'll go in dark to Moldova, find Rex Wolfe and capture him. I'm taking Byrne with me. I trust her instincts. The prisoner transport started according to plan. Mills was shackled, wrists and ankles. Did you see anything in the rear-view mirror A flash of movement. He was out of the vehicle before I could even brake. Don't move. Turn around. Gun. Put this on. Turn around and get on your knees, agent. The cargo vehicle slammed on its brakes, so we did too. And I had just Initiated emergency protocol when Wolfe rolled out of the van... - Uh. Mills. Excuse me? You saw Tyler Brandon Mills roll out of the back of the vehicle. I have Witness statements from other members of the team detailing Mills' escape. Maybe we should fast-forward to your takedown? Maybe... Maybe you should tell me What the hell's going on here. Tyler Brandon Mills, terrorist and criminal mastermind, was able to escape an armed transport convoy. The team leader of said convoy pursued Mills on foot. When Mills attacked, the team leader was forced to neutralize him. Yeah, we, we both know what happened out there. Rex Wolfe killed Mills and he ran. He got the drop on me. After that, Wolfe... As far as the public is concerned, Rex Wolfe does not and cannot exist. Is this because I screwed up? Or... Or are you just covering your own ass? It's neither. It's orders... HQ. Look, this way you get to be a hero. No, I get to be a liar. Well... Nick, as your friend, I would suggest you take the Win. And if I don't? - Then as your boss, I will tell you, it's not a suggestion, it's an order. Your rooms are on the third floor. I'll fetch your bellman. Oh, no, we're good. Thank you. As you wish. Enjoy your stay In Moldova. Ms. Vanek? We suspect Rex Wolfe is laying low in a breakaway territory in eastern Moldova. This area is heavily dependent on contraband and drug-running, and unfortunately the US has no intelligence or diplomatic presence there. So, it's just you two. We've set up backstopped cover identities for you. Emily, you're Sasha Vanek, a steel company magnate looking to expand operations into Eastern Europe. Cal, you're Mitchell Taylor, her head of security. No. Your covers will allow you to talk to private military contractors in the guise of establishing a security presence for your company. The trade council's having a gala, and tapping into the network of oligarchs and their PMC-hired muscle should bring you one step closer to Rex Wolfe. Not even the government knows your true identities. You have zero jurisdiction... and no back-up. An impressive security force? - Hmm. Absolutely, yes. So, we've got the test results back. Unfortunately, your miscarriage wasn't by chance. You have a condition called Obstetric APAS. That and the uterine scar tissue build up from the D-and-C puts you at extreme risk for recurrent miscarriages. What does that mean for the future? It means you may not ever be able to carry a child to term. There's IVF, surrogacy. Options that I can talk to you through now, or... at a later date... Ms. Vanek. I'm Sergei Derkach. Let me be the first to welcome you. - Nice to meet you. I'm looking forward to [earning more about setting up shop in your beautiful country. And there will be plenty of time to discuss business. But right now, you must try our local Divin. It's Like cognac. But don't tell the French, far superior. Noroc. - Cheers. Your guard is free to relax with his colleagues in the smoking lounge. I assure you, there is nowhere safer than Within these walls. Let me introduce you to a friend of mine. Is it good? - Yes, it's delicious. And of course, my bank has very favorable arrangements for our American customers. Moving that kind of currency, you must have an impressive security force? - Hmm. Absolutely, yes. So, how did you set it up? It's a private military company. They can deploy rapidly. They're cost-effective. You didn't hear it from me but... Night Watch. "Night Watch"? I hate to interrupt, but there is someone Ms. Vanek just has to meet. - Oh, yes. Excuse me. Can't let that old fool monopolize your time. Mr. Jeffreys, CEO of Lanceman Auto. Ms. Vanek of El Toro Steel. Hello. - Pleasure to meet a fellow expat. Well, just in the scouting stages right now. It's an odd part of the world. I mean, they still have minefields. Really? - Yes. Well, then, I will tread carefully. - You better. I mean, this whole security gig, It's okay. But holding my lady's makeup bag wasn't exactly what I had in mind when I left the service, you know. Yeah, no, it definitely beats, uh, security in Burundi during the elections, bru. I work for Pandies. You know, just one rough interrogation nets more than six months working for the cocoa farms. Yeah, so you never sewed. right? - No. Well, I started out on the blue Line. The Lebanon border? - Yeah. Where? - Zar'it. 2006. Barn Farm Brigade. I had friends over there. You can ignore those Clowns. You should talk to my guys. No. And Why's that? I'll get a finder's fee, you'll keep the bragging rights. And What's so good about your shop? Couple of years back, I was ambushed in a remote corner of the Helmand province. A place even your Marines are afraid to tread. Yeah, I've been there. I got no desire to go back. So, you know. I'm laying down cover fire, but I'm done for. But then, out of nowhere, a helicopter swoops in and saves my ass. Night Watch. They're the last word in this thing we do, if you're serious. Yeah. There's no cell-service in Helmand, so how'd they find you? Here comes the good part. Would you Like to dance? Yes. I never see you before tonight. I just got into town. Where are you from? - The US. And what do you think of my country? I think it's beautiful. Not all of it. I promise. Yana! Hey. An American with Wolfe's training is a premium in the Local PMC market. Which one? Every PMC in the world has a piece of this place. Well, I've heard of a place we should check out when we're through here. It's where all the mercs hang out. Just remember why we're here. EL Toro, this is Mr. Cosgrove. Hey, so we found out about a few of the majors in the area. One's called the Pandies, and then there's another one called Night Watch. - I'm into it. Neither is ringing any bells, but these places Change names more often than P Diddy. Yeah, I think that was a few names back, Mr. Cosgrove. Mr. Cosgrove Is a criminally uncool soccer dad. Give him a break, Sasha. And how Is young Master Cosgrove holding up? Good. I told him you were on a training exercise And he still wants to know that you're safe. Are you... safe? Yeah. Uh, call me when the local sales figures come in. Okay, bye. Don't let them write your history for you. Hey. I decided to come home for lunch. Alice? You all right? Uh, guys, when's the Lunch? Now. Go wash your hands. We can talk later. - All right. Everyone's talking about you taking out Tyler Brandon Mills. You're famous, Dad. I was just doing my job. Did you kill him with one shot? - Or, did he keep running and you had to pump him full of bullets? How many shots did he take? Come on, Dad, tell me. He died quickly. - Did his blood get all over you? Flynn. - You're awesome. Dad. He didn't stand a chance. That's enough. You need to just let me eat... okay? Just let me eat for Christ's sake I'm done. He's excited. He and his friends, they admire you. Look, I get it. 'Being forced to take a life.' Maybe talking to a professional could help? I'm not one of your clients. Well, maybe I wouldn't have to play counselor if you'd get some help instead of repressing everything under this Captain America facade. You're not the only one with problems. You can't begin to understand. Screw you, Nick! If Rex Wolfe is in here, these guys will know where he is. Stay Close to me and keep a low profile. I recognize that voice. Cal? Cal Isaac! It's really you. Of all the gin joints In all the world. If it ain't my favorite square. Holy shit! Holt Thompson, you old... That was for Yemen. Now we're even. - Okay. Welcome to my joint. You are? Sasha. - Sasha. Holt. First round's on me. - Thank you. Come on, idiot. If you wanna see the downstairs to your upstairs, Sasha, you came to the right place. So, what are the odds that the two of you would meet here of all places? Guys Like us don't become Walmart greeters when we retire. If you wanna keep your hand in the game at an elite level, there's only few places to go. Why Moldova? Well, after it went sideways, I knew a White picket fence wasn't on the cards. Did my time as PMC muscle. - With who? A place I thought I Left behind. But they opened up a branch right here in my corner of paradise. Night Watch. Yeah, I've heard good things. If you like, uh, Big Brother watching your every move, 24 hours a day. It wasn't for me. Oh, wicked. Oh, I am, believe me. What does this do? It was a chip. They implant GPS trackers... To monitor you on missions. Access buildings, charge your lunch tab. I could use one of those. You gotta give it back when you split, though. Along with your company car, tape dispenser. It's a small price to pay to get in with a shot like that. Well, don't worry, it's... I'm not telling tales out of school. Ms. Vanek knows I'm looking for new challenges. Not until you find a suitable substitute though, right? Thought you were looking to go straight? Leave the black-bag jobs to creeps Like me. Yeah, no, I tried civilian life, had me climbing the walls. You know how it is. 80, Night Watch, you got an in? - Not for a minute. I'm on the acquisition side these days You really want in, you gotta talk to the big-time company men. Excuse me. - Yeah. So much for keeping a low profile. Yeah, well, he has no Idea I'm Bureau. He knows your real name. Half the guys in here are working under an alias. And What if he looks into my cover? I don't think it's your cover that he's interested in. I don't care what you think. Focus on the job. Mrs. Vanek? So, What have you got? I did some digging on Titias Tech, they went bust about 5 years ago. But their assets were picked up by Night Watch. Yeah, I've been hearing a lot about them lately. Australian security Intelligence just sent me a photo of Rex Wolfe with the CEO of Titias. That sounds Like a valuable asset. We're conferencing in one of his associates right now. You have company? - Uh-huh. A mere? - Yeah. Buy you a drink? Yeah. I'd like that. - What's your pleasure? Pappy's. I'm Sasha. Jacques. Looks Like you Lost your date. Shall we? - Yes. You need to savor it. Slowly. No. You take it In all at once. Is that the French way with bourbon? It's my way... with everything. What's a woman Like you doing in this shit-hole? What do you mean? - I mean... You're very sure of yourself. aren't you? Yeah. For good reason. This is my security. - Yeah. Security is for little boys.. - I do a dirty job, I like to balance it with, uh... Well... better if I show you. I'd Like that. Dirty job, huh? What's so dirty about an escort duty for the Moldovan glitterati? I don't babysit, pretty boy. I was a guest at the palace. Really? And I bet you've got the chip to prove it. You're Night Watch, right? So do they pay a bonus for TS/SCI? What's TS/SCI, hmm? Top-secret security Clearance. And I have the highest possible. I need, uh, some more privacy, and, uh, stimulation. Okay. - Come. Hey. Hello? No, no! Wait. I will... What? Wait... Wait for What? - Slow... Slow down. Hold on! Hold on, hold on. I don't like it. I don't like it. Please, just... No! Okay - Okay? Hey You guys, you guys, let me borrow your bike. I have money. Here. And your jacket, please. Shit. Hold on. Are you hurt? No. We're going to Night Watch. You don't waste any time. So. where would the monitoring room be? Their GPS and comms room are gonna be hidden, and reinforced I can't tell you where the room is, but a guy as heavy as your boy Jacques, he'd have access for sure. What if we kill the generator? No, look... cameras. They'll have a parallel power supply, redundancy for all the important stuff. That's what I'm counting on. - Hey. Byrne. Damn it, Byrne. Hi. I think I'm lost. Okay, let's go. Don't move. Turn around. Come on, turn around. Focus. Real-time GPS from those body tracks uploads here. Go Bod“! Kick his ass! Hey, focus! Come on. Hurry up. Find Rex. Hey! Turn around. He's thirty miles out. Let's go. You fucked with the wrong people! Hey! Damn it. No, no... What did the, uh... What did the small guy have as a side arm? A Makarov pistol. Makarov pistol, okay. Makarov pistol Are you blueprinting? Yeah. Good. Come here. I really needed to see you. - Oh, likewise. I gonna wanna give you the heads up on a story I'm about to air. Now, seriously? It's about the mysterious death of Tyler Brandon Mills. Does the FBI really expect... America to believe Mills got out of an armed convoy Without help? Mm, I don't know. What does Erika Lyle think? I think you're full of shit. So much smoke and not a damn bit of fire. I'm not Letting this go. - Erica, come on. Baby... Better you hear it from someone who cares, 'Cause soon, every news agency around the world will be beating down your door. So you say. I interviewed a few security consultants. They all agreed. Properly secured prisoner transport vehicles would have two armed guards. Seems a little strange Tyler Brandon Mills had only one guard, don't you think? There was no second guard. - Why not? I don't know... - You're hiding something, Derek. So. now's the time to come clean. On the record, or off. But I am running my report. - No. Okay, well... Wow. I thought this was about more than just you getting a scoop. I'm a journalist for Christ's sake, I'm doing my job. And you know what else? - What? You wouldn't respect me If I didn't. Okay. There is nothing to be gained by us working at cross purposes. Two of us working together would make more sense, right? Meaning? - Meaning, you drop the guard story and I will get you an even bigger exclusive. Okay. I'm listening. I'm listening. Cal? - What? Cal! Listen. It's probably rainwater runoff from the storm. Go. You got it? - Yep. I can't judge its depth. We could be sucked into the water from the plant. Hey, bring them to me. I'd rather take our Chances here. I've got you! It's Cal! It's me. Stay with me! Breathe In. Four. three. two. one... Breathe out. Four. three. two. one. You're good. Yeah. I'm okay. Okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Thank you. The current's getting stronger. Hang on! Hold your breath. Okay. Okay. Hey. Um, Emily missed her last scheduled check-in. I'm starting to get concerned. Well, one missed check-in does not an emergency make. Come on, you know Emily when she's on a lead. She has tunnel-vision. Yeah. I know, but that's What worries me. She thinks that Rex Wolfe is working for Night Watch. It... It's a very well capitalized PMC. Super shady. You don't seem too concerned. It's only been one day. And Cal and Emily are two of the best, so... Yeah, I know but... -So, have some faith. They know how to handle themselves. All right, Listen, I'll put out some feelers, see if there's been any chatter. Uh, tipping off that we're dipping our toes into Moldova, of course. I appreciate that. I got your back, Nick. - Thanks. And, uh, Listen, I'm gonna have to ask you to reciprocate. Uh... Yeah, sure. What do you need? Uh, are you familiar with, um, Erika Lyle? From Channel Six? - Yeah, exactly. Um, I scheduled you for a... sit-down with her. Just to amplify the official line on the convoy. You want me to go on TV and repeat that Line of bullshit? Yes. Yes, I do. Alice? I was just on my way to the Birches. I can't do this anymore. Please, sit. Things were better when I thought that Nick and I could have our own child, but that's never gonna happen! Slow down. What's going on? I can't... I mean, we can keep trying, but the odds are... I'm so sorry to hear that. I think my marriage is falling apart. The distance between us... You have to stay the course... for Flynn. He needs you, and now more than ever. No one ever said it was going to be easy. But this is what you signed up for. Don't you ever get tired of being everyone else's support system? This is the life we have chosen. Maybe you should practice self-care. Find yourself a hobby... a passion. Something just for you. Nick? Come on in. Have you heard from Byrne or Isaac? How're you doing? They missed their scheduled check-in time. Not unheard of for a mission like this. Yeah, I know. but the last time Emily and I spoke, there was a tone in her voice. Scared? I don't know, maybe. Everyone's probably right, I'm... I'm just overreacting. This has been an exceptionally difficult time for you. Being the poster boy for the convoy-Lie. You are just doing your job. I don't remember this part in the oath we took. Our job is to keep America safe, and allow her citizens to sleep well at night. I'd say the greater good is being served. Whether you believe it or not, you're sewing your country honorably. Yeah. It's cold. Here, take this. No. - No, no, no, you're shivering. Here. Thank you. Damn I'm cold. Not me, huh. I'm wearing my ugly alpaca sweater. Smells Like a goat, but it's warm. And I'm taking a big scoop of matzo ball soup. Oh, nice. - Yeah. How's that working for you? I'm throwing a heavy horse blanket over the sweater. Yeah. Well... I'm gonna go for the real thing. You ready? - Yeah,yeah. Hey, come on. It's running. What do you wanna do? Better to ask for forgiveness than permission, right?
