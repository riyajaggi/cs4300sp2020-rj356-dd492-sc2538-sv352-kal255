 You're gonna be okay. All right? You stay with me. No. You can't come in. Please... Okay, Emily, I'm here. We'll get through this together. Hey. You're okay. You're gonna be okay. What happened? Somebody broke into the house. He brought you in. Where's Nick? We're not sure. He was gone when I got to the house.

 Crown's heading up a team. We think maybe Nick was abducted by the people he was investigating. - Flynn... - He's safe. He's still on his swim trip. What is that? It's Crown. He wants to know if you're up for answering some questions. Yes. Okay. I'll tell him. Hey, I'll call you if we find anything. Don't you go dying on me. We're coordinating with the BPD to see if they have any intel on the criminal group Nick was investigating. Okay. What have we got? Any theories? Possible revenge for Nick breaking up the organ-harvesting operation. that reminds me. Pathology sent over the final autopsy results on the four victims. The tox screen shows unknown compounds in their systems and evidence of a rare parasitic infection, suggesting the victims likely came from outside the US. So Nick was right about them being smuggled into the country. We need to ID Nick's informant in this criminal group. - Find him and find out... - Or her. Or her. And find out what they know. Agreed. All right, everyone, back to work. Let's bring Nick home safe. Can you give this to Serrano? Do you think it's possible Emily might know something about Nick's source? I'm on the way to the hospital now. I'll let you know if she says anything. Hey. Why can't I stay awake? It's your body trying to heal. Fuck! No, you can't fight nature, Em. Help me up. It's not me. It's these stupid drugs. I don't want any more drugs, Jack. It's just antibiotics. And a mild sedative. I can take the damn thing out myself. You know that. Trust me, I know, and I'll put it right back in again. Then I'll take it out again. Hope this isn't a bad time. She's weak. Can you... Can you make it short? Yeah, sure. You look good. I look like shit. Where are you guys at on Nick? We're turning the town upside down for him. BPD's helping us to track every lead. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Um... I was hoping that you might know something that we don't about Nick's investigation. Yeah, take a seat. Ask away. Do you know anything about his source? Asian and about 5'2". All right. She's like mid-20s, I think. Good with computers. And then Nick said something spooked her and that's why she ran off. And what about your attacker? Can you give me anything on that? I don't know. Derek, it happened really fast. I don't remember anything. I can appreciate that, but, like, you know, um... Distinguishing marks, tattoos, scars, an accent... He had a white eye. I remember that. He had a white eye and a blue one. They're different. I don't remember anything else. I'm sorry. It's all right. I know it's not a lot to go on. No, no. At least it's a start, right? Yeah. Okay, look, you get better. We'll speak when you're back on your feet.Yeah. We will find him. I know. Fuck! Fuck. Excuse me. Hi. My brother works here. Sorry. Jack! Jack. What are you doing out of bed? I need to find Nick. Okay. Well, let's get you back to your room. The FBI's got nothing. Yeah, well, what are you gonna do about it? I don't know. Something. Listen, I feel better right now... You're feeling better? Really? Maybe you can just patch me up and give me something for the pain. Come on, Jack... You've just had surgery. You've lost a huge amount of blood, and you've also got drugs coursing through your system. Fine. I will leave without your help. Fine. Come on. Did you pull this out yourself?No. Let me have a look. It fell out. Let me have a look. You were lucky. Two inches to the left would have punctured your abdominal aorta. You would've bled out pretty quickly. You know, I've patched you up so many times, but I'm worried that, one day, I'm not going to be able to. Here. Let's go slowly. Yup. Hold on. Okay. Goddamn. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right? I have to do this. I can't let Flynn lose anybody else. I know. I know. Here. Antibiotics. Take them until they're gone. Okay. Painkillers. Two every six hours. No alcohol. All right. So, what now? I'm gonna find Nick's source. See if she knows where he is. Where's she? I don't know. Just kind of playing this by ear. Well, for what it's worth, be careful. I always am. Liar. Nick, who is this girl? She's my source. She's your source? The servant of God, Christina, is baptized, in the name of the Father... Amen. And of the Son... Amen. And of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Are you here for the baptism? No. I'm not. I'm Father Demotses. If you're here for confession, I'm happy to stand as your witness. Yeah, well... I don't really know where to start. It's beautiful. The ritual. Babies. So innocent and pure. But remember, the first baptisms were adults. It is the journey of our adult lives that turns us from the purity and innocence of how we came into this world. And today, through our actions, we have the ability to choose to cleanse ourselves of our adult sins and... And renew ourselves. I don't mean to pry, but, um, is someone hurting you? Um... My, um... ...husband, he and I got into, a terrible fight, and he was really angry, and I'm afraid that, if he finds me, he'll kill me. My friend said that she got some help from here, so... Yes, of course. We offer a sanctuary for those in need. Hi. What's your name? Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! I need to talk to you. No, no! Let go! How'd you find me? Your rosary. I have nothing to say to you. God. What? What? Just hold on! Okay? They... They took Nick last night. They kidnapped him. They took Nick? Yes. Please. Please... Let me go. Let me go. I need to talk to you. Go where? You're hiding in a safe house, and I found you. And if I did, they're gonna find you too. I need your help. If they took Nick, they're gonna kill me. They're gonna kill me. The FBI will protect you. The FBI can fucking piss off! No way. They couldn't even protect Nick. What? I'll take my chances on my own. Thanks. Everything was fine until the FBI raided their organ-harvesting operation. Next day, my employers were asking everyone questions, started following me. They have sources everywhere. Shit. Come on. My God. Quiet. Don't move. Just stay here. I'll protect you. Just stay here. Hi. There are two men in a black sedan across the street from Tanya's House. On Jones, yes. One of them has a gun, I think. Thank you. Are you ready? Are you ready? If I come with you, can you promise not to turn me into the FBI? Fine. Now, we gotta go. Keep your head down. Police, don't move! Let me see your hands. Head down. Head down. Slowly. Head down. Step out of the car! Head down. We're crossing through. Quietly. Nobody knows about this place, so you should be good here. Come on. Here. Take a seat. Can't believe they found me so fast. What's your name? Kai. Kai? I'm Emily. I remember. If you hadn't come along... Jesus. I'm sorry about your husband. Ex-husband. Here. I just assumed. You live in the same house. Yeah. It's complicated. You look like shit. Thanks. Kai, I need to understand why they kidnapped Nick. Does he have something that they want? Did you give him anything? You're religious? Not especially. Dad gave this to me. He was the one who went to church. Even managed to drag me along sometimes. Deal was, if I went with him, he'd finally let me get a pet. Imagine his surprise when I came home with a snake. Even called it Lucifer, just for the shits and giggles. Yeah. Best friend I ever had, Lucifer. Where is he now? Lucifer, or my dad? No, your dad. Passed away last year. Yeah. He was all I had. Taught me to fight for what I believe in, so here we are. I'm sorry about that. The guy that attacked me had two different colored eyes. One was white, one blue. You ever seen someone like that? Kristophe. Does Kristophe have a last name? Probably, but I don't know it. Only saw him a few times. Okay, well, I need to find this guy. They have a place that's a front for their gambling operations. The security people go there. Downstairs under Silvername's Arcade. The password gets updated daily. Can you get me in there? Well, since yours truly wrote the code, won't be a problem adding you to that list, though this will be a problem. You can't wear that. It's not that kind of party, hon. And you're not afraid of being tracked or anything, right? I only access the Internet via VPN or by jumping between open wireless networks. It makes me harder to track.Okay. Cool. Bingo! The password is "Wolfgang." All right. I'll see you later. Wait. You're not leaving me here, are you? Don't worry. You'll be fine. Ha! Kick his ass, Kristophe! Come on! Kristophe! Kick his ass! Get him, Kristophe! Come on! Kristophe! Kristophe! Kristophe! Stay down! Yeah! Hey. Hey! Baby, baby... You okay? Come on. Come on. Now, let me get you in the car.Who the fuck are you? I'm gonna get you home. Yeah. You're gonna be good. Hey, Kristophe, you all right, man? Yeah, he's just not feeling well. I'm gonna take him home. There you go. Come on. Maybe get him an ice pack. You know what? Smart. I'll do that. Thank you. You poor baby. You're gonna be fine. - Don't worry. I'll get you. - Why am I here? There you go. - All right! - You poor baby. You remember me, asshole? You... You drugged me? You just do what I say, and everything is gonna be okay. The guy that you kidnapped, I want you to take me to him. Fuck you. I just punctured your abdominal aorta. I'm told you can bleed out pretty quick. Now, either you take me to Nick Durand, or I'm gonna let you sit here and die. Fuck you. Your call. Fuck you. Fucking asshole. Where is she? Where's the hacker you were working with? And what did she tell you? My... My head hurts. My head hurts. Listen, just tell us where is she, and this will all be over, okay? Um... Can I have some water? What? Can I have some water? Water. Sure. So, where is she? Where the fuck is she? You really think I'm kidding? You really think I'm kidding, right? Where the fuck is she? Good evening. What do you want? What is this mess, Gregor? I'm tired of cleaning up your shit. Don't worry. The situation is under control. No, you don't. Let's get to know each other, Agent Durand. Where do I turn? Hey, wake up. Wake up. Where do I turn? Fuck! Fuck! God! You said you'd take me to a doctor! Where the fuck do I turn?God! It's the next right! Next left! Next left! Under the bridge. Under the bridge! It's an abandoned warehouse. Fuck, I'm bleeding! If you're lying, I swear to God, I'm gonna... He was... I was there a few hours ago, and the agent is still alive. So you can just drop me here, or just take me to a fucking hospital or something, please! I'm gonna die. Is that it over there? Shit. Jesus, please!Just calm... Calm down! I'm gonna fucking die! Please! God. Please. Is that it over there? Yes, that's it. That's it. I'm fucking... I'm gonna fucking die! Keep the knife in. You'll have longer. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Come back. Fuck. No, no, no. Come back. Wait, wait, wait. Hey. And then you stabbed him? In self-defense. Come on, Emily. You do realize you are still on suspension, right? Derek, Nick was here! Check the DNA on the chair, canvass the area, you'll find something. Look at that camera angle. Let's find the owner of the garage. It's in line. There. It's Nick. He must have been the car. What car? There was a car that cut me off on the way in. Okay, get this video to Tech and find me that car. Fuck. I had him. Fucking had him. Excuse me, guys, sorry. Please, just give us a moment. Please? - Please. Thank you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where are you going? I need to go to a hospital. Two minutes. That bitch tried to kill me. Special Agent Byrne missed your vital organs on purpose. So what? Should I thank her? No. But maybe you want to give a little bit of thought to your future and how much better off you'll be if you cooperate with us. What do you want? Do you know this man? Maybe. I think he's Meridian. Hey, do you mind if I have a little chat with our friend here? No. Thank you. What the fuck are you doing? I need a doctor! I want a doctor! Where's the doctor? So this involves Meridian? I'm not talking to you. Hey. God, you're hurting me! I'm sorry! Jesus! You're gonna give me an infection! I didn't know you smoked. I don't. Who's this guy? That's all I know. Jesus Christ! Please, stop! Name. He's just here to clean up this mess. Please stop! You're gonna kill me!Who's this guy? He's Meridian's fixer. Name? Dawkins! Dawkins! Dawkins! That's all I know. He's here to clean up a mess or something. Please, stop! I don't know any more! You're gonna infect me! Thank you for your cooperation. You sick fuck! You could have killed me! Yeah, but I didn't. The guy we're looking for, his name is Dawkins. He's a fixer for a European criminal organization known as Meridian. And why would they kidnap Nick? Well, it's gotta be something to do with his source. Either way, if Meridian is sending someone like Dawkins all this way to abduct Nick, he's in a lot more trouble than we thought. Seriously, what the fuck? It's cold, and I had to piss in a bucket. You lied to me. I don't know... What info did you give Nick? I don't know what you're talking about. Talk to me! What did you give him? Okay, yeah, I gave him a decryption key. For what? As soon as I realized they were onto me, I launched a piece of code... What kind of code? A sophisticated algorithm that attacked my employer's database. Okay? Stole files, contacts, details... Locked them out of some of their accounts. I encrypted what I stole. I relocated it to a cloud vault... What are you talking about? I just wanted to make sure that, if things went bad, I could trade stolen files for my life. Does Nick know how to access this? Sort of. You need a microchip to get to the cloud vault and then the decryption key to unlock it to gain access to the files. Nick has the key. I was gonna give him the chip once I was safe. And what does all of this have to do with Meridian? That's who I work for. What did you take from them? I was kind of in a rush. I didn't... I got some details on their operations and shit. I didn't take a long look. Okay? I just... They got all kinds of powerful people wrapped around their finger to keep their secrets secret. Shit. But it's okay 'cause I have an insurance policy to keep myself alive. And what is it? Anything happens to me, and my black hat friends release the files and, boom, that shit goes viral. You came to my house. You put my family in danger. Did you give Nick up to save yourself? Look, I never meant for any of this to happen. Okay? Hey, baby. Yeah. No, no, I'm not gonna be there for dinner tonight. No, I'll see you at breakfast. Okay. Yeah, I'll bring donuts, of course. I love you too. Okay, I'll see you soon. Night-night. Your son? Yeah. You're so badass. What? It's weird to think you're a... What? Mom. Surprise. And Nick's his father. Yeah. They're pretty close. Probably a lot like you and your dad were. Only now, Flynn'll probably never see Nick again. Come on. That's not fair. Yeah, well, neither is life. Okay, fine. I'll help you get Nick back, but I can't stay here. It's cold, and there's no toilet. You should have brought her in. Yeah, well... I mean, Emily, she called it in. She's cooperating. If this thing involves Meridian, it's much bigger than we thought. Yeah. What do you know about Meridian? Not much. They were a small-time criminal operation, expanded over the last few years. Now, they're a transnational.- Tentacles everywhere. It's possible Meridian's connected to the organ-harvesting operation. Meridian is mentioned more than a few times in your redacted file. The mysterious stretch between when you left the military and joined the FBI... Care to share what that's about? That information is part of an ongoing national security investigation. I don't really care. I have an agent missing, and I need answers. And I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say anything further. You omitted it from your FBI application. Unfortunate how these things have a tendency to follow people around. What exactly are you getting at? Boston PD got a hit on a white Mercedes. It's parked outside a warehouse on the riverfront. It's Dawkins. We've got him. Ma'am, no entry. Bureau called me in. Let her through! - Where are they? - He's up here. No movement yet. We think Nick's inside. Okay, you're good here. Wait, Cal, I need to talk to you. Okay, thermal imaging's detected a heat source inside the building. And the plates match the Mercedes on the video. You okay? It's definitely Dawkins. We're hoping Nick is in there with him. So what's the plan? We're sending in a tactical team, hoping to use non-lethal force to subdue Dawkins so that Nick doesn't get caught in the crossfire. So, once they breach the doors, they'll launch a concussion grenade, and we'll move in. Tactical in position. - You guys ready? Okay. - Ready, yeah. You good? Let's get Nick out alive. Yeah. It can wait. Okay. SWAT team. Go! Go! SWAT team on the move. We're 50 yards from the building. Nick! Status report! Was that us? Negative. Came from the building! Move! Move!
