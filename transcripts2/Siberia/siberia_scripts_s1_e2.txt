 Previously on Siberia... Welcome to Siberia. Through the woods, red flags mark the path to find the settlement. The last two to arrive will be sent home immediately. Berglind, Harpreet. We discovered this... shed in the middle of a field, but it was locked. You know what? I don't think we should tell anyone about this. Oh!

 Oh, my God. There was this crazy sound that came out of the woods, like a growl or something. I work with animals, and I've never heard an animal like that before. The fly agaric is a mushroom native to Siberia, but beware, 'cause this mushrooms are poisonous unless boiled. - Hmm. - Ew. - Great. - Tommy! He just kept going deeper and deeper. We called for him, and then he was gone. - Oh, my God. - It's one of the cameramen. There's been a very serious accident involving Tommy.

 And unfortunately... it's fatal. What? We've been discussing whether or not to go on with this, but we've decided that that choice should be yours. I'll be coming back at the end of the day to get your answer. It just... doesn't make sense for something like this to happen. Especially to... to him. I mean, we didn't know him that well. Known him a couple days, but it felt like we knew him. I think it's just-- ultimately just shock between... between all of us. It's just one of those things that you don't quite... know how to assess, because it's not what we... we thought we was getting ourselves into. Like, we didn't think our lives would be at risk. So what you thinking of doing? Staying? Yeah, man. Yeah? I'm staying. You? Tommy's death, you know, is affecting people differently. Daniel... he's taking it pretty bad. And I think he's... he's keeping a lot of it in. But I think eventually, it's gonna come to the surface. He was an amazing guy, you know? And he didn't let me quit. We're grown-- we're grown adults here. They can just say... what happened to him, you know? And I think we have a right to know what happened to him. I just thought it was just gonna be a competition. Just... a regular competition. It's gonna be hard, but I didn't realize it was gonna be dangerous... until now. Hello, everyone. Can we all just gather around real quick? Okay. Um, so I understand this has been an incredibly long and difficult day for everyone. There's a lot to take in. But I need to remind you all exactly where we are. This is an incredibly dangerous place. We're in the middle of nowhere. If something happens to you here, it's so hard for us to get help. We're still working on getting information with regards to what caused Tommy's death. At this stage, we're hearing it was a fall that he suffered, so... that's all we're getting right now. Um... but I need to know if you guys have made up your mind. I need to know who wishes to stop right now and leave. George? You're leaving? Yeah. It's, um... I'm just done. Okay, George. Anybody else? Okay. I've decided that I should take the $5,000 and get back to my life. I don't think this is any kind of way to go. You know, I-I got a mom. I-I got friends. I got family. I don't want them to hear I-- I-I died in the woods in Siberia because I was trying to win some money. George was the only one who decided to leave, which was really surprising to me. Um, I would have thought there would be way more people wanting to go. And I think that affected my decision, especially because once I saw that most everyone was staying, it pushed me to want to stay, as well. Um, I think if half the group had left, then maybe I... maybe I wouldn't have stayed myself. I was surprised that George left. He was the last person I thought would leave. He worked hard. He was always dirty... 'cause he worked pretty hard. Maybe I'm a quitter. This has upset me. I may not get $500,000, but at least I'm walking out of here on my own terms, not in a body bag. So long, Siberia. Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com _ "What you seek you shall find hidden on this map." - Is it food? - So we went over, and they pulled out bullets and a map. So we're all assuming it's gotta be a gun. - Why-- why can't I hold on to 'em? - Just for safekeeping, okay? - Do you-- do you even-- - I don't trust anyone with bullets right now. - Do you even know how to fire a weapon? - No. Exactly. So we need to go and look at the map now and go find the gun. I took a stand and said no, I'm gonna hold on to the bullets, because I have a... I have a inkling that there's one or two people that... shouldn't be handling those kind of things. Does anyone here know how to fire a weapon besides me? - What-- - Yeah. It really surprised me when Sabina raised her hand. The only time she speaks is when we're talking about handling a gun. So to me, that's, like... mm, you know, what's going on with this girl? - I think you should hold them. - Yeah? Yeah, I think you should keep them. Can I see the map? When we went to run into the woods to look for the rifle, I followed her. I don't know why. My instincts said follow her. I told her I-I know the shortcut to come to that place so we can get a gun, because she seemed very serious about this gun situation. She wanted it. I didn't come here to get laid, but if that happens on the way... awesome. Hey. - You find it? - Hey. Did you find it? Did you? You don't have it? No. I-I didn't find it. Why are you looking up? You think it's up? Yep. For some reason, I feel like everything's been so difficult, I-I think it'd be too easy if it was just laying on the ground, you know? Hmm. The reality is, everybody's here to win. Johnny's just more honest about it. Are you from Bogota? _ Yes. I learnt a little. You're full of surprises. So you gonna-- you gonna let me know if you find it? Yeah, right. "Yeah, right." I went off with Neeko, Irene, and Victoria to go find this "X," wherever it may be or whatever it may be. Oh, hey. Whoa. Neeko, I mean-- That's an "X." That's an "X." We almost missed it, but, uh, I just happened to look back and saw two trees that were in an "X" shape. I'm like, "Oh. That's an 'X.'" This is becoming the long cut, not the shortcut. Believe me, it's a shortcut. They have a long way to go. Aah! Sorry. Did I get you? Hey, this is... - I guess... - The path has stopped. Your shortcut... You don't know where you're going. - This is the end. - Are you serious? Nowhere to go. I think the river is down. What... what is going on here? You... You're supposed to be on my side. Well, we spent all night together and you didn't let me touch you. I mean, I know we wanna be discreet, but... - but seriously... - This isn't... this isn't... - This isn't cool, though. - I lied to her. She believed me. She thought we are now best friends. I had to do that. I wanted to be alone with her. We believe we found the "X," 'cause that was the only tree in the forest that was, like, crisscrossed. I looked down at the floor and I open up a hollow log, which, to me, a rifle could easily slide inside. But it was missing. It wasn't there. - Any idea? - I think I know who has it. Okay. I guess we're going back. _ We didn't even go in the right direction, did we? - We tried. - Well, it's not... We found the, uh, the "X" on the map. - You know where it is on the map? - Yeah. We came back. We believe it was in the log below. But someone's been there before us. - So somebody's got it. - Someone's got it. - Someone here's got it, but... - Not-- not us. Not us. We were-- we were way off the mark. You haven't seen it? No. We were running. We were just looking together. So who's-- Either someone's lying, or someone-- he has it, or... Well, who's still away? Who's still not here? - I'll ask this guy. - We were lost out there. We're serious, Miljan. Where's Johnny? If it is a gun, there are certain people in this camp that probably would keep that to themself. Are there still mushrooms left? Yeah, but don't eat those, remember? They're poisonous if you don't cook 'em. I don't think they've been cooked. - Yep. - Don't eat them. Okay. _ I don't know. I think you get sick. You get really sick. Probably just throw up or something. Can you make sure the fire keeps going? I'm gonna go take a little nap. I've been up since super early. Here. You can use this. Just make sure. I'm gonna go investigate, you know, the area where they say Tommy fell. There wasn't an explanation. I mean, there was, but it wasn't a good one. Not to me. I just-- I don't buy it. I want to know more. - Ugh. - Hey. Oh, hey. - How are you? - Oh. Are those the last of the mushrooms? Yeah. They rationed them. I thought we ate them all last night. Yeah, me, too. Can I have some? I'm really hungry. Mmm. - They're good, huh? - Mmm. I guess when it's the only thing you have. Do you want any? Oh, no. I've already been eating them. - I feel like the biggest pig. - Okay. You can finish them. What happened? - It's empty. - What? - Someone took it. - Where did you have it? I hid it under the bed. I put it there last night. Who else was in there? Everyone? Yeah, but I think I know who took it. Johnny. This look familiar? Yeah. Those are your bullets. Come on, guy. I haven't got-- I haven't got time for this. "Guy"? My name's Johnny. Johnny. Whatever. I haven't got time for this. Time for what? Your bullshit. - My bullshit? - Yeah. Just be a man. Confess. Tell us... Tell me if you have it. You saw me take those? I didn't see you take it, but I think you took it. Then why would I confess to anything? Because I think you've got the gun. - You think I've got the gun? - I think you've got the gun. And you think I took those, but you have no idea? I'm pretty sure you've got the gun and the bullets now. - Pretty sure? - Yeah. Okay. Neeko. What's going on? The bullets are missing. - What? - The bullets are gone. - I hope this is food. - What is it? - Aah! - Aah! - Aah! - Aah! Fuck! I ran over there first. I reached there first. I-I pushed the hatch, and then I kind of saw something moving. But as I pushed it a bit more, I realized it was a snake, and I kind of jumped back. - Shit! - Oh, my God. A snake. What are we gonna do with a snake? - That's awesome. - Let's get-- get a stick. Are they serious? I wasn't sure if the snake was poisonous, but Sam, he had no fear. He just, you know, he stepped up to the mic. Put it on top of its head. Watch out now, guys. Be careful. Be careful, Sam. To me, I just see food. A snake is protein. They say it tastes like chicken. So my intention is to cut its head off, gut it, we cook it, cook it good, then we eat it. I could see the snake was over something metallic, you know? And when I looked again, it was-- it was a small little key. That's why they put it in there, too. Close to the snake was a key. It clicks in my mind, because I immediately knew what it was for. - Just follow me. - What? Keep the snake. Follow me. I know what this is for. It's funny, because Miljan told me not to tell anybody, and then... he enjoyed taking all the credit, you know? Like, "Oh, I know. Follow me." Let's not make it a secret. What is the key for? You stay there, play with the snake. Come! When did you guys find this? Miljan found a shed that had a lock somewhere deeper into the-- into the woods, into the forest. Why he kept that information from us, I don't know. - Let me see. - Quick. Quick. Oh, my God! - Oh, yes. - Yes! - Oh! - Oh, my God! - All good stuff! - We're saved. - That was awesome! - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Oh, wow. And carrots, too. Up to this point, we hadn't had any real filling source of food. And when we opened the shed, it was just, it was like... paradise. There was food everywhere. There were buckets of peanuts and buckets of apples, and... and-- and tomatoes in jars and garlic, and all these things that would solve all of our problems, because we don't have to worry about looking for mushrooms anymore. - Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. - I'm starving. - Wait. No. Wait. What if-- - Oh, my God, there's beer. What if this is the only food that we're gonna get? - We can't... - Well, we are starving. - No, we can't... - We can have something. Hey, hey. Hold on. No, no, no, no. Why are we even giving him any... - Listen, listen... - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. There's eight people here. Take what you can grab, man. Guys, I think we should, uh... I'm so hungry. I know, but I think we should ration it. 'Cause this might be all we might have to last us till winter. - What'd you say? - I think he's right. This is all we might have to last us till winter. Oh, put it back. All right, well, then you know what? Manage your own shit. Excuse me. Johnny. I think he's right. A part of me wanted to side with Johnny at the food shed because it did make sense what he was saying. He wanted to just divide the food, and everybody can ration their own portion however they want. But Neeko's been such a good leader so far, I-I just sided with him. What are you talking about? - How 'bout we just all take our own food? - No, because... - You're nobody's dad. - No, listen. But... Why don't we compromise? - If... it could be... - You know, hey... Let's compromise. Everyone get their own food. - What's wrong with that?! - Let's just ration it. We don't know how much more we're gonna get. Who's gonna be in charge of rationing this? - We'll all check it out. - Hey. Excuse me. Somebody put it down. - I think he's right in a way. - I think he's right. I stepped forward and I suggested to the whole group, "Look, calm down. I know you're all excited right now, but we should make this stretch out as long as possible." And then Johnny wanted to take, you know, food for himself, being Mr. Selfish. So then Sam stepped forward arguing with him. Which was nice for a change, 'cause I've always been the one that had to confront him. - We're gonna ration it out. - Irene. - Huh? Who's "We"? - We're gonna ration it out. We. Everybody. Everybody's gonna get the same amount. Okay. All right. So everybody can take their own food. I don't care. Put it down. Put it down and everybody step out. Everybody. I think it was an idiotic idea to... to ration it out, you know? Um, I don't like the idea of someone else being in charge of my food. Um, I... you know, I can take care of myself, and I can-- I can ration the food out how I want. I can't believe you guys are gonna trust this guy. You don't know this dude. You let someone be in charge of your food - and in charge of your survival? - We know you. We know you. - You do know me? - Yeah, we sure know you, Cowboy. - Yeah. - Yeah, Country Boy. We know you. You guys, you know what? You guys are making a big mistake. All of you. I think the group now is, uh, finally seeing Johnny for himself, and he's basically out for himself. And he felt defeated in the sense of... that he's lost some kind of... I don't know. He's lost something now that other people spoke forward, and said, "Look, Johnny, no. You're not gonna take this food." We're excited, but we also have to be smart. All right? I'm gonna finish up here. I'll join you guys soon. Just gonna count up what we have. Okay. - Okay? - Let's go back then. You going back? Nobody even thanked me for finding this. - Thank you. - Thank you. Miljan, thank you. You're a rock star. Good job, Miljan. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Sam... I'm trusting you with this key. Why don't you hold on to it? No, no, I'm trusting you with the key. Do really want to trust me with the key? I trust you. I gave Sam the key to the shed, because I knew... I knew that at that stage, we kind of... we was on okay terms, but I wanted to, um... bond us closer, you know? So I gave him the key to the shed. And I think that kind of... He saw me in a different light from then. Sam's a-a good man. He works really hard. And I'm-- I'm really glad that he's here. Oh, my God. What the fuck? What the hell? Are you getting this? I walked up, and there was just-- there was blood everywhere. It looked like something... big had, you know, just ripped through there. Whatever animal it was, it was really big. Because I found a print that I can't make sense of. I mean, this dwarfed a bear print. We shouldn't stay here. We gotta get out of here. We gotta get out of here now. We gotta get out of here now. Let's go. Go! I don't wanna be here. You keeping up with me? Damn it! - Fuck! - Oh, God! It's bad. It's bad. You need to put pressure. - Shit. - You all right? Hold it tight. Hold it tight. - Hold it tight. - Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Take more. This is dirty. This is dirty. - Let's put this... - Just below. Get some of the boiled water. Get some of the boiled water. Come on, get some fresh water. Quick! - We know. We know. We know. - That's clean now. Think it's gonna hurt more if I put it on? He's really pale, guys. Don't... yeah. Johnny, do you need to lay-- Oh, my God. Say something, man. Give me-- give me the scarf. Give me the scarf. Give me the scarf. Give me more gauze. Give me more gauze, guys. Come on. Do we have medics or something on this show? Come on. Come on. Get the pillows. Get more pillows. Let's raise his head up. This is-- this is ridiculous. Do you want to go? - I think that's a good idea. - Do you want to go get help? - I'm fine. - Are you sure? - I'm fine. - I think that's a good idea. - No. - The only way to help this is for you to go across the line. There wasn't one moment in time where I thought I was gonna quit the game after I chopped my finger off. I knew I could take care of myself, and... I'll get a fake finger with $500,000 in my pocket. I believe that respect gets you respect, and, um, compassion earns you-- gets you compassion. And right now, I have no respect for Johnny, or compassion for Johnny. Are you okay? Yeah. Does it hurt still? Little bit. Can I ask you something? Shoot. Do you have the gun? Whoa. What is that? Stay close to me, okay? Hello? Sabina. What are you doing here? Just don't go in there. There's a dropoff. You will fall. When I was trying to get back to camp, I got-- I got lost, you know. And I was already in a panicked state from what I saw, what I found... and I-I got my directions turned around, and thankfully, I ran into her. We have to go. It's getting dark. Move. You all right, Victoria? You notice that? There's butterflies everywhere. - That's-- - There's what? Do you want us to get you something? Do you want some-- We could make you some tea. No? Okay. Is that weird? Are you okay? You're acting a little strange. This isn't right. What's not right? What's not right, Victoria? When I arrived there, she was just... her eyes were, like, dilated, and there was no-- no one knew any-- anything. No one could give me an answer, like, "She did this" or "She did that." Look in her eyes if you can. You'll see her pupils are... huge. Victoria? She looks drunk. Just give her a minute. At this point it's unknown. Like, really unknown. Uh, but she... she wasn't... with us. She just might need to go compose herself. I don't think so. She say anything to you guys? No. Nothing that made any sense. I tried to ask her if she ate anything weird - or drank anything. - She was saying a couple weird things. - Like, mumbling, or... - Yeah. She thought that the ash was butterflies, I think. All right. I'm just gonna go make sure she's all right, so... I'll be-- I'll be right back. Whoa. Hey, come here! What the hell is this? This is like cave art or something. What the hell? Move! They're hunting something. Something big. Her pupils were huge. Before you came, she was asking Natalie... That's what I mean. That wouldn't be from... - No. No. - No. She was asking Natalie, "Where am I?" That's weird. I don't know. Maybe... I thought maybe she's just freaked out from Tommy's death or something. Like, she wasn't dealing with it-- Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Don't touch me! When she says not to touch her, I wouldn't touch her. Who was here? Who was here? What happened? We've been with her. She's not making any sense. We don't know what's wrong. This is how she's been. She hasn't given us a clear answer with anything. You're all dead! - It's okay. It's going to be okay. - Don't scratch yourself. Sweetie, don't do that. Sweetie. Sweetie, don't do that. Don't do that. Come on. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't hurt yourself, okay? Victoria? It's gonna be all right, okay? Why don't you let us help you? If you can just tell us, we can help you. Do you know-- ugh. _ Some of us had guessed that maybe she had eaten some of the mushrooms before them being properly cooked, because that can poison a person. _ You know, I could tell just by looking at her that... that... something was wrong. Um... and she had-- she had to get it out of her system. So I knew how to help. I just stuck my fingers down her throat. Oh, my God. You're okay. - You're okay. - That's good, though. Fire. It's... it's... - What? - It's... It's... fire. - What's-- - It's green and it's... _ _ The sky. - Didn't I tell you not to stop? - Yeah. - Did I tell you? We have to go. - Yeah. I know. I know! Shh. What's that? What is that? What is that? Shh! Keep the blanket on. Yes, keep-- don't take it off. Don't take it off. No, no, no, no. Come on. - No, no, no, no. Come on. Come on. - Shh! - You're gonna be okay, Victoria, okay? - Victoria, just breathe. She's getting worse. I think we need to take her to... We can't take care of ourselves. We can't, like, babysit other people. She's really, really... sick. Nobody knows what's going on with Victoria. She's not talking to anybody, and we can't figure it out. If she's sick, I don't want her to be here overnight, - because, I mean... - It's gonna be your call. - Yeah? - Whatever decision you make, - I'll go along with it. - Okay. But make a decision. It's just a scary thing, 'cause no one knows exactly what's wrong with her. So I don't know. I'm just trying to think... What... what would be the right decision to do right now? It's okay. It's okay. Listen to me. It's okay. Breathe. Victoria. She's not doing good. - Relax. - They were poisonous. - She said she was scared. - Shh, shh. What? She could die. Poison is in her system. Somebody should have come to help her, like, maybe a few hours ago, when it started to just, you know, build up. - Guys, guys-- - It's in her system. It could be too late. - She could die. - Listen, listen, I think we should take her to the pad. No. It should be her choice. We should let-- we should let this pass on for a little-- So what-- you wanna wait until she can talk? Yeah, it's gonna wear off eventually. Okay, we're gonna take her, okay? - No more discussion. - No, I think she should go. No! No! No! - Oh, my God. - You're scaring her. No! She's just not responding. Her eyes are very dilated. She's shaking. She's sweating. She's really hot. Like... it's just mass confusion right now in what we should do with her. It's all right. Victoria, breathe. - Let's get her up. - Victoria, breathe. - Be careful. - It's all right. No! Aah! One less person. She doesn't want to go. That's cruel. Aah! Aah! It's gonna be okay, Victoria. Calm down. Calm down. It's fine-- - No! - Victoria, calm down. No! - Great. - Ugh. Yeah. - Run! - Go! Go, go, go! Let's go! - Run! - I'm running! Wait. Stop. Stop. Stop. Is it gone? What was that? Is it gone? Is it gone? I don't know. I don't know. Turn off the lights. The lights, the lights! I think it's gone. What was that? What was that? What was that? - Aah! - Watch her head on this rock. Lift her up. Lift her up. We're gonna get you some help, Victoria. - Careful. - Aah! - Almost there, almost there. - It's okay, honey. Once we got to the line, we realized we had a big problem-- the button wasn't there. So we had this big dilemma. So what happens if we cross the line? I-- We're out? Watch out, 'cause you're about to. Step this way. As soon as you're over the line, then... - Then you're out. - Then you've quit, so... - But don't-- - I think if we put her over, she'll... - The producers will come. - They're not even responding to us right now. - Kick her out. - Dude, we cannot leave her like this. - What? Kick her out? - I mean, roll her out. - No, we can't. - She obviously needs help. So what are you saying? Just put her over the line and that's it? - Yep. - Yeah. You can't. She can't even walk. That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard. - But they'll come. - No, they won't! Let's make it simple. Let's roll her over the line and get her some help. They'll probably show up. Is anyone willing to sacrifice themself? Are we close to the camp? Please tell me we're close... There's a fire. There's a fire. You see a fire? - Where? Where? - Shh! We made it. I know. I've never been so happy to see this place. Girls? Nobody's here. I don't know. Aah! Why don't we just try to get her over the line? I think that maybe we're overreacting here. I mean, our... She had the mushrooms. I mean, they're supposed to be... I mean, mushrooms are hallucinogenic, right? - I mean, look... - I have had a bad trip... - Maybe this is just a bad trip. - ...off of mushrooms before. It will pass. I will stay up and watch her through the night. It will pass. She will be fine tomorrow. What if she freaks out again? I mean, I think she should be out. Dude, we're in no position. Neeko, our mayor, decided to get her back to the camp, to the cabin. Natalie's gonna watch her first. I'll go second. Whoever wants to go third... I don't know. You know, speak up now, okay? Carolina. Okay? We're in no position right now just to leave this girl like this. She's been sick. All day. These motherfuckers should have come hours ago. Come on. You guys wanna carry her back? - That's enough time. - Let's take her. Hold on... Do we have any guys who maybe want to help carry her? I don't think we should. Well, get the fuck out of here, then. Don't just stand there. What are you here for then? Leave. You're useless. - Then go! Go. - Absolutely useless. ...the proper help. This is ridiculous already. What, you're just standing over-- to watch, - like a peanut gallery? - All right. We'll take you back home. Relax, Victoria. Relax. You really think she's getting better, do you? Let's get in the front. I just thought that she would get nauseous, and then want to touch the button and leave, but, um... she's in a completely different state of consciousness, and that's not what I... what I intended to happen at all. I expected Victoria to get sick. I didn't expect her to lose her mind. This went a lot... a lot further than I thought it would go. Victoria's in bed now resting. All we can do at this point is just monitor her. It's kind of hard, because, you know, we don't know exactly what's wrong with her. _ _ _ _ Oh... she seems a bit stable. Where have you been all night, Daniel? You missed the whole show. I was with Sabina in the woods. - Ooh. - Ooh, did you guys hook up? No. We were just walking back there, actually, kind of lost, - and... - And then? And we heard a... sound. It was basically-- I don't know. I've never heard anything like that before. We took off running. And... every time we stopped, it stopped. What are you talking about? "It" stopped? Telling the guys was... more or less just embarrassing for me. You sound like you're scared of the woods or something, man. They just ripped me off, made me feel little. Made me feel like I'm an idiot. I think he's trying to scare us into pushing the button. - Mm? - Mm. Mm. I'm not trying to deceive anybody or tell lies or steal, or, you know, take advantage of anybody else. I'm-- I wanna be a team player in this. Victoria? Wake up! - Victoria. - Victoria. Come here. Victoria? - Shake her up. Shake her up a little. - Victoria. - Victoria, wake up. - Come here. Victoria! Victoria, wake up. - Victoria. - Feel her pulse. - Does she have a pulse? - No. - Victoria. - Victoria? Wake up! I don't think she's breathing. Wake up! I don't think she's breathing. Wake up. Wake up. Come here. Victoria? Victoria! I don't think she's breathing. Victoria. - Victoria. - Feel her pulse. - Does she have a pulse? - No. - Victoria. - Victoria? She has a pulse. Victoria, wake up. Victoria-- Are you okay? - Oh, my God. - Can you open your eyes, sweetie? - Yeah. - Good for you. You scared us. - We need to give her-- - Don't do that to us. I know, that was-- freaked us out. Heart attack here. Sorry. Just feel-- just feel a little sick. Okay. I woke up to go check on-- on Victoria, see if she was okay. By the time I reached the cabin, she'd come to. - She's back. - Yes. She's back. You gave us quite a scare last night, huh? - I did? - Mm. Have you eaten anything? Drank anything since morning? She's been having a little bit of water. Yeah, well, you look a hell of a lot better. Thank you. So do you remember anything? - No, not really. - Nothing? How do you know that she ate mushrooms? Maybe she's just crazy. - She's not crazy. - I don't think she's crazy. I'm asking. I think she is. - You're suggesting. - No. No, it's a good question, though. I don't think she's crazy. That's not what mental illness looks like. Well, I don't know. How do you know? - Because... - Because I've seen it. Oh. Just spaz out for one night. Okay. It was just a very scary moment when-- when she got sick, because it made us realize that we are here on our own, and that we do have to do whatever we need to do to survive, and that's just the way the game is. Yeah, I just spoke to, uh, Victoria. She, uh, she's made a decision that she's gonna leave. - Really? - Yeah. I think what happened to her last night, you know, tripped her out so much, she has to go. Like, she... I tried to convince her, you know, to stay. But she was pretty adamant that she's gonna leave, so... Well... fine. You know, she wouldn't give me a reason, so I don't know what's... you know. That's the logical thing to do, right? She's been through the ringer, I think. You haven't changed your mind? No. All right, sweetie. Wish you all the best, okay? - Mm-hmm. You take care, okay? - All right. You, too. Feel better. Thank you. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, sweetheart. - See you. I think she wanted to leave even before last night. I spoke to her the night Tommy died, and she was not dealing with it very well at all. She just said she didn't want to quit. So I think... She was in rough shape after that. Yeah, so I think... in a way, maybe it's a-a blessing in disguise, 'cause everyone would understand you leaving after what happened. She was out of it last night, but she seems okay today. - She said this this morning? - She did. Like, the weirdest thing for me was that she just said that we all should get out of here. Like... But she wouldn't, like, explain what she saw or... nothing. She probably doesn't want to relive it. Like, that was pretty intense. I don't think... It might take a while before, you know, she can talk about it. She had a rough night. She doesn't remember what happened to her? No. Victoria. Hold up. I don't-- I don't get it. What? You're gonna leave because of a bad 'shroom trip? Wasn't just that. What was it? I didn't say anything at camp, but I remember everything that I saw, and I'm not sticking around, - 'cause I know what's gonna happen. - How do you know? How-- I just know. I... I don't want... I don't want you guys to get hurt. I just know what I saw, and... What exactly did you see? You guys are all gonna die. I know. Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com
