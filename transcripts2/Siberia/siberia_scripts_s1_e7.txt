 Previously on Siberia... (Joyce) I think we need to get out of here... (Johnny) We went to that camp, and it's a complete ghost town. No one's there. We're pretty much here on our own. (Daniel) There's a radio. - (Static crackling) - Someone's jamming the signal. What's going on here?! - Why are they fucking with us?! - Stop it! Aah! (Thuds)

 I think what we need to do is we need to protect ourselves and prove that something happened here. So you guys keep filming. We want a record of it. (Annie) Daniel found this light. I guess it'd been there all the time. We just never saw it. (Daniel) I'm going in the morning. You guys wanna go, that's fine. Oh, my God. Guys, what happened here? (Joyce) Whew. - Oh. - Yeah. Johnny, can I have some water, please?

 Something weird had to do that to all those trees. Did it have anything to do with the sky? The green sky? If there's enough debris in the air from that explosion, maybe that caused a refraction of light. That doesn't make sense. - (Joyce) Like a nuclear bomb? - No. How are you so sure? We'd all be dead. (Joyce) What is that? (Clangs) (Joyce) What is that? - (Sam) It's our helicopter. - Oh, my God. Where's the rest of it? (Joyce) Oh, my God. They must have wrecked, right? - (Daniel) See anything? - (Sam) No. - (Johnny) See anything, Sam? - (Sam) No. You? (Johnny) Joyce? - (Crying) - (Johnny) Joyce? (Joyce) Oh, my God. (Crying) (Sam) What are we gonna do? (Joyce crying) (Sam) That was our ride home. (Daniel) It's almost like it exploded out of the sky or something. Doesn't make any sense. Where are the bodies? Guys... It's getting dark right now. We need to look for shelter. Get a campfire going, okay? Can't be walking around tonight. I'll find some wood, get a fire. You guys build a lean-to or something like that, okay? All right? (Sam) Somebody keep an eye on her. (Daniel) She'll be okay. (Breathing heavily) (Groaning, gasping) (Speaks indistinctly) Hey, Irene. It's okay. - It hurts. - I know. I'm sorry. - (Annie) Hey. Get up. - (Neeko) What? (Annie) Get up. - (Neeko shivers) Oh. - (Esther) How'd it get this cold? Look at my breath. Hey, where's Sabina? Seen Sabina? - (Miljan) Huh? - Sabina. (Shivering) Uh... What's going on? (Neeko) Yesterday was boiling. How does it go from boiling hot to freezing cold right now? (Miljan) Can't be this cold in the middle of the summer. (Neeko) It's impossible. (Esther) I can't feel my feet. Oh, my God. Fuck. What the... (Annie) Miljan, what's going on? (Miljan) I can't even open the door. What? Guys! Look at this! Snijeg! Holy shit. - Is it snowing? - (Neeko) Look at that. - (Esther shivers) - That's not possible. It was boiling hot yesterday. ?

(Johnny) We gotta keep going, guys. (Joyce) Maybe we should go back to the settlement or something. - We came too far. - What-- what do you mean? - We came too far. - What? Look how long it took us to get here. We gotta move on. - Yeah, but at least they have shelter. - (Johnny) Listen, guys-- - (Joyce) We don't know how-- - They need our help now, too. Hey, listen, guys, we're closer to the beacon than we are to the settlement, okay? We gotta go this way. If we go back there to the settlement anyways-- even if we do get back there in time, we won't have enough food to survive. Okay. - (Johnny) All right? - (Sam) Go. (Johnny) Keep moving. It'll keep our bodies warm. (Esther gasps) It's so cold. This is not normal. Is she okay? She's in a lot of pain. But she's gonna be all right, yeah? I don't know. It's gonna be okay. (Breathing heavily) Pray for me? Can you pray? Uh... I... (Stammers) I wouldn't know what to say. (Irene) Anything. Okay. Okay. (Sniffles) (Shivering) Angel of God, o my guardian dear, to whom God's love entrusts me here, ever this day be at my side to light and guard, to rule and guide. Amen. I didn't know you were religious. I used to be. - (Door opens) - (Esther) Great, guys. Oh, guys, thank you. Quick, quick. Come in so we can shut the door. (Miljan) My hands are purple. (Esther) This is good. This is good. Is this everything that they had over there? - (Miljan) There's a few more things... - (Neeko) It's all we could bring. It's all we could bring for now. It's freezing. Sabina wasn't there. I thought she would be in the cabin. Nobody's in there. She's not-- she wasn't there. - (Neeko) It's freezing. - (Esther) Annie, take a blanket. - Here you go. - (Shivers) (Miljan) My God. (Neeko) Hey, sweetie. - I can't... - How you hanging? (Irene) I can't do this. (Neeko) Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. You just gotta hang in there. They're gonna come back with help, okay? (Miljan) Come on, man. (Neeko) Don't worry. Did any of you guys actually think what we're gonna do if they don't come back? I mean, we just gonna stay here and watch her die? So you have a better plan? I mean, when an animal is hurt, and there's nothing you can do to help it, you know what to do. (Annie) She's not an animal. (Miljan) That's not the point. I mean, come on, guys. They're so far away. Look how cold it is outside. They're probably frozen by now and dead. Even if they're not, they're not coming back for us. For her, there's just two options-- she can die slowly here like a dog, - or we can help her out and let her go. - You are not saying that. - Fuck. - You are not thinking that. (Neeko) Dude. What's wrong with you? Huh? What's wrong with you? What are you suggesting? What are you exactly trying to say? - I want to help her out. That's what I'm saying. - In what way? Are we gonna play God now? Hmm? _ Guys, like I said, all we can do is hold tight and wait. Wait for the guys to come back, try and heat this cabin as well as we can... - Yeah. - ...and just wait. That's all we can do right now. - (Esther) Okay. - Okay? (Clapping) (Daniel) There's a clearing up here. - (Joyce) Ohh. - (Daniel) Keep moving. (Joyce) Oh, my God. (Joyce) We should have gone back. I told you. We keep moving. We can make it by night. We'll be all right. - All right? - (Daniel) Yeah. Johnny. (Lowered voice) This is bad. I know. (Neeko shivers) (Door opens) - (Sabina) Hey. - (Neeko) Sabina. (Esther) Where've you been? What is this? (Annie) What are you wearing? Food, clothes, supplies, and a bunch of stuff. (Esther) You've got food? And clothes? Where'd you get this shit? (Annie) Where'd you get all that stuff? - (Sabina) I kept it. - (Miljan) I knew it. - (Annie) You kept it? - (Esther) What do you mean, you kept it? Give us some answers. What's going on here? You've got all these fucking warm clothes... - I knew it! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Let her speak. - Where have you been? - (Neeko) Hey. Stop. Stop. Let her speak. This was my way to win the game. Steal from the camp, uh, hide in the cave until the last of you were gone, then come out and claim the prize. Well, there's no game. I know that. That's why I'm coming clean and sharing everything. (Esther) What else is in the cave? There's nothing. I brought everything. - I just said it. I just said it. - Oh, really? And we just believe you? So is this where you've been disappearing to all this time? - Yes. - You go off to this cave, - and you, what, peek in on the food that you've stashed? - Yes. Okay. Enough with the cave. If anyone else is hoarding anything, it's time to bring it out, because that's all we have right now. - I don't have anything. - I don't have anything. (Sabina) Neeko? Miljan? Fuck all of you guys. I didn't take shit. Now I wish I did. (Esther) You got clothes for us, too? No. I have a pair of boots. But the camp, producers' camp, they have a lot of clothes. Coats and boots. We should go. Where's that? I can take you there. (Breathing heavily) (Sam) What if it's just a light? What if it's just a beacon... when we get there... and there's nothing there? (Breathing heavily) (Daniel) Whoa. (Johnny) Holy shit. (Joyce) What do we do? We gotta find... - (Sam) It's too wide. - (Johnny) Yeah. - (Joyce) Yeah. - We'll never get across that. (Johnny) I think maybe we'll keep walking down the bank. Maybe we'll find, like, where it's not quite so wide, and it's maybe completely frozen over. (Breathing heavily) Thank you so much for helping me. Ah, you'd do the same for me. I just didn't think anyone could be so nice. What was the... the prayer that you said for me earlier? Um... it's just something I remember my mom saying when I was little. Where is it from? Well, you wouldn't believe it, but I was raised Catholic. My mom would have a heart attack if I told her I didn't believe in God. You don't believe? After everything that's happened to us out here... how could there be a God? After everything that's happened here, how couldn't there be? (Sam) Johnny, what do you see? You see anything? (Johnny) Yeah. I think this is gonna work. _ (Johnny) It's definitely the shortest part of the river - we've come upon. - (Joyce whispers) Careful. We just gotta... test it. (Joyce) Yeah, be careful. What if it breaks? (Crackles) (Joyce) Be careful. (Crackling softly) (Sam) Nice and slow. (Crackling) (Crackling continues) - Yeah. - (Joyce gasps) (Sam laughs) Come on. (Joyce) I'm scared. (Johnny) I weigh twice as much as you, Joyce. Come on. (Johnny) There you go. Okay. No, no. No. There you go. Easy. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (Wind gusting) (Sabina) Okay. We gotta be fast. Okay, everything you find, get it. (Sabina) Neeko, look for coats. - You okay? - (Neeko) Sabina, did you see any clothes? - Sabina. No clothes here last time? - (Sabina) Yeah, there should be. Search. - (Sabina) We got it! - (Miljan) What? (Sabina) We got clothes! - It's winter stuff... - (Sabina) Grab everything. Everything. We need stuff for Irene. (Esther) Grab the backpacks. - (Sabina) Pants. - Is there any shoes around? - There should be. I don't know. - Huh? Pants. Here, put 'em on. (Esther) Guys, there's fruit! There's fruit! Put it in your pockets! - (Miljan) Is it frozen? - (Sabina) I got it. No, I found it already. Take the whole thing. We can take the whole thing. - (Neeko) How much is there? - (Sabina) Okay. (Neeko) So let's just take the whole thing. That's good. (Music box music playing) Boots, guys! (Sabina) Oh, that's good. That's great. - Esther? - Yeah. You find anything? (Laughs) Yes. Necessities. (Laughs) Sabina! You'll be happy! - (Neeko) You carry this? - (Miljan) I will. (Sabina) Let's go. - (Johnny) Easy does it. - (Daniel) Yeah. (Joyce) Yeah. - All right. Sam? - (Joyce) Come on, Sam. Come on, Sam. You can make it. (Crackling) - (Sam) It's cracking. - (Joyce) No, no. Come on. You got it. - It's not cracking. - (Johnny) No, it's not. No, it's not. (Cracks) (Joyce) Come on! Sam, come on! - (Crackling) - (Joyce) Oh, come on! - (Johnny) Fuck. - (Joyce) No! Pull him in! Pull him in! Come on. Oh. (Joyce) Sam, are you okay? - You're wet. - (Sam) I'm all right. (Daniel) You are soaked. - (Johnny) Dude, let me see your foot. - (Joyce) Let me see. Let me see. - Let me see. - (Johnny) We gotta get your foot dry. - (Joyce) Sam, let me see. - (Sam) I'm okay. Let's just keep moving. - Come on. Come on. - (Johnny) Let's go. Let's go. (Howling in distance) What the hell was that? Did you hear that? (Sabina) Let's keep going. Keep going. (Esther) Neeko, look at that. What is this? (Miljan) Come on, guys. We should hurry up. It's fucking freezing here. Come on. (Sam) Been walking for hours. (Panting) And we just keep walkin', walkin', and walkin'. And my knees are killing me. I got bad... The injuries I've had, I just keep falling. I keep losing my... I keep losing my footing. (Johnny) How's your foot, Sam? (Sam) I'm okay. - Sam, are you okay, man? - (Sam) Yeah. I'm way cool. - (Sam) Ooh! - (Joyce) Oh, my God. Fuck! - (Johnny) Sam! - (Joyce) Oh, my God! Sam! Sam, I'm coming, buddy! (Johnny) You all right, buddy? - How's your head? - Sam. - It's fine. - Huh? - Sam, are you okay? - You okay, man? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Look at me. What's my name? - Johnny. I just... - Okay. I hit soft snow, and I just slipped. I'm sorry. - All right. - (Joyce) Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - (Johnny) Can you walk? How's your foot? - (Sam) Yeah. I'm okay. - (Johnny) Yeah? Hang on. Just give me a second. I just wanna-- Hold up. Just give me a second. (Johnny) Hold his head up. Sam, we gotta-- I gotta see your foot, buddy. - I'm okay. I just needed a second-- - (Johnny) I gotta see your foot, man. (Sam) It's fine. I'm telling you. - I just... - We're just gonna look at it. It's okay. (Sam) I hit some soft snow, and I just lost my footing. (Sabina) Come on. We're almost there. - (Sabina) You're fine? - (Miljan) Yeah. Esther, come on. I gotta pee. (Sabina) Oh, that's great timing. Let's get the sock on, get the shoe on. I'm ready to go. Okay? I'm fine. (Joyce) Sam, I don't think you can walk like that. (Johnny) We can't stay here. We just gotta get going. (Sam) Is it on? - (Joyce) Come on. - (Sam) Before the weather gets any worse. (Johnny) Put your hand over my shoulder. (Joyce) Come on. (Johnny grunts) - Okay. - Okay. - (Johnny) You good? - Got it? (Sam) Yeah. - Oh. - (Johnny) Take it easy, bud-- (Sam groans) (Sam) I tell you what. You guys go. When you get there, you figure out a plan. (Joyce) We can make it. You can make it. Come on. We'll all hold you. I'm done. I can't feel my foot. I'm sorry. (Hammering) Sabina, we need to get the stove working. We got potatoes here, sitting here. No one wants to eat raw potatoes. We could cook these potatoes, but we don't have water. (Clatter) (Sabina) What are you doing? It's food. Thank you, sweetie. (Horn blaring in distance) (Miljan) Is that the Revealer? I thought it was broken. (Cup slams) (Esther) Guys! Did you hear it? Come on! (Miljan) We thought it was broken. (Esther) I know. Did you see anything coming out? (Esther) I just came back from peeing, and it's going off. - (Sabina) Let me see. - Miljan! - (Sabina) Miljan! - Oi! What the-- Are you fucking stupid?! (Miljan) It's a mechanism. The mechanism's inside! This is, like, titanium! - Aah! - Stupid! - Fuck! You do it! - Look at you! Look at you! (Neeko) Yeah, run off! Yeah, go have a little temper tantrum. (Miljan) Good luck, genius! Idiot. (Esther) He's freaking me out. Stupid. He think he's gonna break it open with this? It's impossible. (Neeko) Sabina, the only way we can get this open is at... maybe at the bolts... (Sabina) Yeah, maybe. I'm thinking about it. Try it. You wanna try it? (Esther) Let's just get the snow off it and have a look at it. (Static) (Static) - (Neeko speaks indistinctly) - (Annie, in distance) Help! Help! Come on, guys! Guys! What's that? (Sabina) Run. Go, Neeko, go! (Annie) Neeko! Sabina! Help! (Annie) Help! Come on, guys! Help! (Gasping) Aah! Get off! (Neeko) Get off her! - Fuck. What are you doing to her, man? - (Sabina) What did he do? What did he do? He was trying to kill Irene! - (Miljan) Fuck no! She asked for it! - Take him to the men's cabin! - (Neeko) Move. Move! - (Sabina) It'll be okay. We'll tie him down. Take him out. What's wrong with you, man? Huh? - (Esther) What happened? - (Miljan laughing) (Sabina) He tried to strangle Irene. (Miljan) Why would I-- Lying bitch. - (Neeko) Huh? - (Esther) He strangled her?

Look at me. Look at me! Look at me! - (Miljan laughing) - (Sabina) Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. You gotta stop now. You gotta stop. We'll tie him down. We'll tie him down, okay? You gotta stop. Hey. (Neeko) Hey. Thinking we have to get out of here. I know. How? I don't know. I guess all we can do for now is... try and get this thing open. Yeah. - Sam. - You okay? - You okay? - Yeah. There was something I was gonna bring... - You're not making any sense, Sam. - I would have brought with me, anyway. You gotta have-- you gotta be prepared, and have everything with us, you know? - I, um... This is so silly. - (Daniel) His pulse is slow. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not even cold. You know that? Not even cold. - You're not cold? - (Sam) No, I'm not cold. (Johnny) Wood's too wet, guys. You couldn't find any other drier wood than this? (Joyce) There was nothing. That's all I could get. Kulik's diary. - Kulik's. The jour-- - What? What? Kulik's-- Kulik's journal. - It's the journal. - You have it in there? - He has paper? - (Joyce) Yeah, we could use that. (Daniel) Says he's got the journal. Sam, where? He doesn't have anything. Did I give it to you? Give it-- you give it-- give it-- you give it to her. Grab it. In the journal. - Give it to him. - I don't have it. Kulik. Would you be so kind not to read my book? You want your book? (Miljan) Yes. (Choking) You have to understand something. If you ever, ever, ever, ever touch that girl again, I would have to kill you. You get it? Tell me you got it! Do you get it? (Spits, panting) (Johnny) We gotta go or we're not gonna make it, guys. We can't just leave him like that. He's dead weight. - He can't walk. - What do you mean, dead weight? - We can't just leave him. - He can't walk. Guys, you can't leave him here. We gotta make it to there if we want any hope of survival, because when that sun drops, who knows how cold it's gonna get? Sam would never leave you to die, man. I know it. Okay. Grab the pack. (Joyce) We're gonna leave him here with nothing? - I'll stay. - No. Daniel. You're gonna die if you stay. You realize that? Not if you go, and you... and come back. Bring some help. Just go. We'll come back. - (Daniel) Go. - Take care of him. I will. Is it budging at all? (Grunts) Fuck! - (Grunts) - Neeko. (Grunts) I'm not doing this anymore. - Come on. - Spent, like, an hour on this thing trying to get it open. Wait. Neeko, look at this. What is that? (Neeko) It's probably nothing. (Esther) It's a hole, I think. Can you see in? It's probably nothing. Have you seen that yet? (Esther) That shape. I recognize that shape. Let me get some light. Let me see. No, hang on. I... I remember, I found something at the... at the producers' camp, and I put it in my pocket, and it was that shape. I know. It was metal. I swear it was that. It was that. Look. Look. It's that shape. It's the same. Come on. Come on. Turn it 'round. Yeah, turn it. Turn it. (Clanks) It clicked. I heard it click. It-- it snapped something open. Here. Here. Here. Wait, wait, wait. It's opening! - Give me your hand. Give me your hand. - You've got it. You've got it. You've got it. - Give me your hand. Give me your hand. - You've got it. (Esther shrieks) What the fuck. - It's open! - Wow. Look at this stuff. - Guys. - Look. Look. - Oh, my God! - (Esther) We got it open! - We got it open! - How-- how did you do it? We found this key at the producers' camp. (Sabina) There's-- there's food here. This... it's rice. It's rice. Okay. (Neeko laughs) (Sabina) Sleeping pills. - (Esther) Sleeping pills? - (Neeko) All right. What else? What else? Sleeping pills. (Neeko chuckles) We've got a book. (Esther) "The Idiot." Oh, my God, those sick bastards. - We got a fire extinguisher. - Hey. (Neeko) There's some... There's some vodka. (Esther) Oh, my God. It's vodka. Oh, we got some chocolates. - (Sabina) Matches! - (Esther) We got matches? - (Neeko laughs) - (Esther) We got matches! - We got matches! - (Laughs) We got matches! - (Neeko laughs) - Elohim. (Esther) We got matches, guys! - We got vodka. (Laughs) - (Neeko laughs) (Daniel) I don't know if I made the right choice. I don't think Johnny and Joyce are coming back. (Irene screaming) Aah! Aah! (Sabina) It's okay. It's okay. Give her a drink. Go on. - (Screaming) - (Sabina) You're doing great. That's it. That's it. That's it. (Breathing heavily) (Esther) Guys, what about the sleeping pills? We've got sleeping pills. We could give her that. (Annie) Is that for her benefit, or yours? I'm trying to help. (Miljan in distance) Guys! Come on! (Irene breathing deeply) Guys! I'm freezing here! (Annie) It's Miljan. (Miljan) Come on! - Bring me some water! - Do we really have to feed him? Let him starve. He should at least have some water. I'm not going over there. Well, I ain't going over there. So what, no one's going? Is he tied up well? Sure. (Door creaks) Brought you some water. Let me go. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. I didn't do anything wrong. She was begging for mercy. I just tried to help. Just drink the water. You pig! - (Laughs) - (Clatter) I know about the Revealer. - What are you talking about? - Mm-hmm. You know exactly what I'm talking about. I'm not an idiot. I know what you took from it. Now be a good girl. Come over and let me go. Or I'll tell everyone. I think you and I are going to be really, really good friends from now on. (Shivering) (Daniel) How you doing, Sam? Sam? I need you to stay awake, okay? Just keep shivering. Keep shivering. It'll keep your body warm. I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? _ (Whispers) They're not coming back. They're coming back, Sam. They're coming back. Don't go to sleep. Sam, don't go to sleep. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam! Sam! Don't go to sleep! Sam! Help me! Do something! Sam! Sam! Sam! - (Johnny) Daniel! - (Joyce) Daniel, what happened? Did he get buried? What happened? - Sam? - Is he alive? - (Crying) Sam... - Buddy. Come on. Hey. You gotta wake up, dude. We got shelter. - Sam, wake up. - Hey. Hey. - Sam, wake up. - Come on, buddy. - (Joyce) Sam. - (Daniel) He's gone. - (Johnny) Sam! - (Joyce) Sam! Hey. Yeah. Hey, buddy. Hey. You with me? - Hey, we got... we got shelter. - Sam? - You're gonna be all right. - (Sam mutters) Okay? _ - Yeah, we're ready to go, man! - (Joyce) Yeah! - (Johnny) Are you ready to go? - (Joyce) You wanna get up? Huh? Come on. One, two, three. Aah! ? (Daniel) How did you find this place? (Johnny) Joyce... Joyce found it. All right, Daniel, come to the front of him. I gotta scoot him in this way. - (Daniel) Yeah. - (Johnny) All right. Can you squat down? Squat down, buddy. Squat down. (Grunts) (Joyce) Okay. (Johnny) I'm gonna start building a fire for you. (Joyce) Talk to me. (Sam speaks indistinctly) (Daniel) Come on. (Johnny) Come on. - Come on. - (Joyce) Sam, wake up. - (Rubbing) - Sam, do not do this. Can you get that fire going? (Johnny) There we go. - (Daniel) Oh, yeah. - (Joyce) Come on. - Oh, my God. - (Daniel) That's good. Get his shoe off. I got it. (Joyce) Check his foot. Let's try to get that dry. (Johnny) Watch-- watch your elbow. - Okay. - Don't burn it. - (Sam mumbling indistinctly) - (Joyce) What? (Mumbling) (Johnny) Oh, God. (Neeko) Annie? Yeah. (Neeko) Esther? I'm fine. I don't drink. There's no way that the rest of the group found help. I mean, they left right before this hit, and they've got nothing. (Daniel) We weren't that far away when Sam fell. I mean, like, we've gotta be, at most, just a few hours away. (Johnny) Well, doesn't matter if it's a few hours or one hour. If he can't walk in the morning, we're not going anywhere. We're not gonna be able to carry his ass again like that. I never thought it would get this bad. (Neeko) All right, guys, I know we've all had a rough time and everything, but look-- look what happened today. We found matches, we got clothes. Just for tonight, I just want us just to relax, enjoy the moment. Tomorrow's another day. Okay? Cheers. (Sabina) L'Chaim. (Esther) Cheers. (Clunks) (Sabina) Mm. Annie. I got something for Irene. (Neeko) Could I get a little bit? It's musical. Open. (Music box music playing) - Cool. - That's great. Where did you get that? (Sabina) Found it at the camp. Just to lift her spirits. Thought she's like it. Aw. She'll love it. (Daniel) I wonder how the others are doing. (Joyce) Oh. The others? Much better than we are. Hope Irene's okay. (Johnny sniffles) ? Guys. Guys, get up! Get up. Get up. Neeko. Neeko, get up! (Annie) Sabina. Sabina. - (Sabina) Aah. Aah. - (Annie) Wake up. - Oh, my head. - (Esther) What's going on? - Irene's not here! - (Sabina) What? She's not here. Look. Where'd she go? (Annie) She couldn't have walked out of here on her own! Did you see her? (Sabina) Let's go. Let's go look. (Annie) Irene!
