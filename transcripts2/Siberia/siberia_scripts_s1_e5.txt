 Previously on Siberia... (Jonathon) There is a safe zone with a button that will summon a helicopter. Once you cross the line at the safe zone, you are out and have forfeited the competition. (Neeko) I went to check on the bullets, pulled out the case, and-- and they was all gone. - You think I've got the gun... - I think you've got the gun. - And you think I took those, but you have no idea? - I'm pretty sure you've got the gun and the bullets now. Okay.

 I'm sort of open to love in any form right now. Get under the bed. Get under the bed! (Sam) The sky's on fire. - (Woman) Carolina, are you okay? - (Woman) Oh, my God. (Shouting over each other) Stop it! Stop it! He didn't do it! Why'd you set me up? (Clanking) (Daniel) Are you an actress? I didn't want to set you up. They told me to. - Who's "they"? - The producers. You helping the show? ♪ (Esther) We've just found out

 that Carolina is not one of the contestants. She's actually an actress. Look, there's no producers here on set. I'm-- I'm... I was hired. - I am an actress. - So hey-- You're an actress... I was hired to just move the story forward and make sure you all looked good. (Voice breaking) And I never wanted to hurt anybody. And then just things started happening that were out of control, and after last night, I'm just done. And I'm sorry if I hurt any of you guys. She's been the one to set up all this... Everything, um, that's gone wrong. (Crying) But it was never my intention. This was just a game. This was just... a job. So all your-- your getting hurt was-- was not real? All your scratches and everything was... I was hurt, and that's why I'm finished, and that's why I'm coming clean to you guys, because I want to go home. (Johnny) Kiddin' me, man? I got-- I got duped... by this woman. And, uh, it just kind of made me doubt myself, and I was... pretty pissed off. (Natalie) What about the shed? (Carolina) I only followed instructions the entire time. You burned the shed down? I guess they said there's no rules, so maybe I should have expected somethin' like that. But I didn't expect it coming from Carolina. - What... what about him? - I swear I didn't know anything. - I didn't know anything about last night. - What about him? I don't remember. I don't remember anything - about last night. - Do you know if we would have found him in the woods, he'd be dead right now? That's why I went out to get him. That's exactly why I went out to get him. (Neeko) It was a deep shock. I felt somewhat stupid, 'cause she had me fooled completely. Uh... And so-- and at the same time, angry. Because I thought what happened was that Johnny attacked her, you know? So I just... (Sighs) almost felt used, in a sense. Look, I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone here. (Woman) Wow. - (Woman) Um... - (Exhales deeply) Well, she-- she can't just... She's got more answers. (Esther) Well, there's no reason for her - to make that up, is there? - And I'm not the one to ask. I think maybe you girls need-- Someone needs to talk to her, - because... because, uh... - Talk about what? (Annie) Yeah, I don't want to talk to her. Find out more information, to see if there's more information. We were all pissed. Real pissed. Especially given the fact that somebody could have got hurt really bad because of her. Regard-- whatever the producers are saying... (Sam) We can't just let her walk off into... The sky, we can't deny that that bloody happened. That was... for real. It... it doesn't explain everything that's happening to us. I want out. I want to know what happened. I want to know. I want to see the tape from last night, because I need to know what happened. I did not sign up for this. _ _ (Birds chirping) (Camera rustling) (Camera rustles) ♪ Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com (Fire crackling, sizzling) Morning. Hey. You guys seen Natalie? Um, I haven't, but I only just got up. - See her? - No, I haven't seen her. She wasn't in bed when I just walked out. Why? I'm just wondering. Haven't seen her yet. (Footsteps approaching) (Sam) What are you doing? I'm just tired. You just been sittin' around the last couple of days doing nothing. Why don't you go get some water or something? I'm actually thinking about it. "Actually thinking about it"? Why don't you just do it instead of think about it? Lately, Miljan is the most laziest person in the camp, bar none. He always has an excuse. He's winded. He hurt himself. He's got mosquito bites. Always making excuses so he doesn't have to do any work. And I do not have any time for him anymore. Wanna learn how to fish? Come on. - "Wanna learn how to fish"? - Yeah. Sam, I'm from Minnesota. I'll teach you how to fish. Come on. (Wind gusting) (Child giggles) I was out in the middle of the woods hunting. It was very quiet. I was listening for deer. And out of nowhere, I hear... It really sounded like a child. (Chuckles) I thought I was hearing things, and then... (Child giggles) I heard it again a second time. And funny enough, it came from a different direction than it came from the first time. (Whispers) Did you hear that? - (Choking) - Give it back. Give it back. Touch my things again, I'll kill you. Is that clear? What is wrong with you? You don't touch my stuff, either. This is a necklace, um, that I always wear. It's very close to my heart. It's very, very important to me. That's the thing that keeps me going, and it's... that's my... my heart. (Exhales) (Child giggles) Who's there? (Giggles) Miljan? Miljan. (Miljan) Irene? What are you doing here? Huh? Um, I'm-- I'm deer hunting. What are... you doing here? I was just killing time. Any luck? I saw, like, so many of them-- like, huge ones, right there. - Did you go this way? - No, I haven't, but... Oh, then let's go. Let's go. I wanna show you. Come with me. Right this way. Like, there are, like, at least six of them. Come with me. Let's get some food for the guys. (Sniffling, clears throat) (Sniffles) (Neeko) Just, like... I don't know what I saw. (Esther speaks indistinctly) What's going on? You okay? Just listen to this. "Annie, I made a big mistake. This morning I realized I miss my ex too much to jeopardize things with him by staying here. I need to leave before things get bad. I hope you understand." (Neeko) Natalie's gone. She left a note. She didn't say anything to anybody. Annie found the note. She was very distraught. All we can look at it is in the sense that she couldn't handle it. I guess it's gonna be more money for whoever reaches the end. But it's just weird how she left. (Esther) Annie's really upset. And Natalie's gone, and I think they might have had a little bit of a special connection, those two. Um, so I don't know. It might be enough for Annie to call it quits as well. Right now it just feels like, yeah, there's a bit of momentum. People are dropping off. Hopefully, everyone just packs up and leaves. (Inhales, exhales) (Sam) So what's this I hear about, uh, you giving some kind of a gift to Irene? (Daniel) Yeah, I, uh, I found a really pretty blue rock. - You gave her a rock? - Yeah. - A rock? Really? - Yes. Yes. Okay. Well, you know, everybody's, uh, given a bad gift now and again. Get those. - What's so bad about it? - I'm just saying... She liked it. I saw it on her face. (Sam) I once gave a girl a snowball. - (Daniel) A snowball, Sam? - Yeah. - Wow. - Actually, I-I threw the snowball, and I hit her in the face. She was a pretty little thing. Even with that little welt on her eye, you know? (Daniel chuckles) So I give a rock, and you give a rock-hard snowball to a girl's face. - There you go. Exactly. - You give so much. What the hell is she doing here? Just ignore her. - Don't... - What? ...talk to her. - Why not? I wanna talk to her. - Don't even look-- - What did I say? - Whatever. - I'm-- I'm gonna go talk to her. - Fine. Yeah, you go. (Daniel) Carolina! Hey. Uh, I wanted to ask you, like... What's do you think's gonna-- I mean, what's gonna happen with you now? I don't know. I guess I'm fired now that you guys all know who I am and what I'm doing here. I really didn't think you did anything wrong, personally. Like... This is just a show, isn't it? (Saw scraping) Hey, mate. How you doing? Hi. Was, uh, wondering, uh... about your take, what happened in the woods yesterday. - My take? - Yeah, your take. Do you have any recollection? I told you I don't remember anything, man. Just some funky shit. It thought if there was one person who I could trust, it'd be Carolina. Guess I was wrong. Uh, so, oh, you think Carolina was just-- what she was saying was just, like, to scare us? Hell if I know. Anyway, uh, how's your finger? It's fine. Looks like we don't make the best fighters, huh? You don't. I didn't get this from fighting. Well, anyway, I'm just... I'm just glad that you're okay. (Saw scraping) Hey, guys. Hey. I see you're back, huh? Yeah. What'd you get? What'd you get? - Little ones. - Ooh! - It's fish. - Yummy little fish. Okay. Tell me. Which one? Who caught them? (Neeko) Truthfully? (Daniel) I caught more than "a couple of fish." (Sam) Yeah, well, I was schooling him. Yeah, you've got a good number there. For lunch, huh? Breakfast for me. - Good job, guys, good job. - Thanks. Where's, uh... where's Irene? I saw her. She, um... She-- I think she might have gone hunting. I saw her take off with the bow. Johnny, you want some fish? I ain't hungry. (Sam) What's his problem? Guess he's lovesick. Miljan, I don't think this is the right way. (Miljan) Trust me. (Miljan) Yes! You got it! (Squeaking) (Irene) Aah! - (Irene) Aah! Aah! - This is all right. This is all right! Oh, my God. I'll be right back. (Crying) Where are you going, Miljan?! Aah! Someone help me! (Sobbing) ♪ (Laughs) Howdy, stranger. Hey. What are you doing, sitting over there? Ah. Just admiring the view, actually. (Johnny) I was kind of minding my own business, and I look over, Esther's sitting there just takin' a gander, I guess. I told her I usually charge for shit like that, but, uh... I let her slide. Can I have my pants? If you give me a smile. - That's not a real one. - That's a real smile. It's not! (Laughs) Give me my stuff. (Johnny) Yeah, apparently, Esther thought I was a little-- a little lovesick since, uh, Carolina duped us all. Um, and I told her that wasn't the case, you know? And I wasn't really butthurt about it, just... just kind of pissed off I got tricked, you know? Oh, hey. If it isn't the little actress. - Hey, what's the rush? - (Carolina) Irene got hurt. I just heard on one of the walkies she hurt her leg. Are you coming or what? Why, so you can blame me for that like you did the shed? I'm telling the truth. Truth. What's your real name, then? Joyce. (Under breath) Joyce. So I guess we could be one step closer to winning the game. What? Irene. I mean, if she's hurt herself, she'll probably want to go home. Yeah, well, what if she's, like, really hurt? Well, they'll just probably fly her out. I mean, that's the game, right? (Clicks tongue) Guys! Guys! Irene got hurt. - (Neeko) What? - (Daniel) What happened to her? (Out of breath) Irene got hurt. We were in the woods. Hunting for deers. And this thing fell on her. And her leg is pinned down to the ground. She's stuck out there. - And you just left her there? - Wait-- where is she? (Neeko) And he's like, "A trap fell from one of the trees, and she's trapped underneath this..." He described, like, a bear trap or something. You know, so it was just this instant confusion of what the hell was going on. We just jumped up and said, like, "Where is she? Lead us there." You know? I haven't been able to get ahold of anyone. Where is she? Just show me where she is. - (Miljan) This way. - (Neeko) This way? (Daniel) As we're running, all I can think is, please let her be okay. (Sobbing) Get it off! (Miljan) I don't even know what is this-- that thing, the trap. It looks like it's human-made. - (Man) Irene! - (Woman) Oh, my God. (Neeko) Guys, get her-- we need to get this off her now. What happened? (Neeko) Guys, we need to get this off her right now. We-- Everyone get a corner. (Panting) (Neeko) Everyone get a corner! - Daniel! You have to get a corner. Grab a corner. - Okay. - You need to get this off her right now. - Here I come. (Sam) On three. One, two, three. - Aah! Stop! - Okay, stop, stop. Stop. Stop! Stop! Stop! - Oh, my God. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. (Carolina) She has something through her leg. Right through her leg. We can't lift it. (Neeko) Where are they? They should have been here by now with the medics! What is this?! It's a fake deer head. Who would build something like this, huh? Who did this? I don't know, okay? I don't think they did this. - (Sam) And who is it supposed to catch? - (Carolina) I don't know. - Okay? - (Johnny) What the hell happened right here, guys? - (Sam) She's bad. - I don't know. This thing fell on her, and it's through her leg in there. We gotta get this thing off her now, guys. Come on. (Daniel) It's through her leg. If you pull it out, she's gonna bleed out, do you understand that? (Johnny) Tie-- tie it off or something. - Tie-- tie something around her leg. - A tourniquet. A tourniquet. No, I got it. I got it. (Johnny) We're gonna get you out of here, - it's gonna be fine, all right? - Take it. Just tie it around. (Johnny) Okay? Stay with me, all right? Just tie it around tight. (Irene breathing heavily) Daniel, you stay with her, okay? - (Johnny) Irene. - Don't look at it, Daniel. Just hold her. (Johnny) Lift, guys! - (Irene) Aah! - (Johnny) Unh! (Carolina) Oh, my God! (Irene) Aah! (Daniel) You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You did it. It's off. It's off. We're gonna get you home, okay? (Breathing heavily) (Daniel) You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. - (Carolina) Oh, my God. - (Daniel) We did it. We did it. We got it off. We got it off. - Oh, my God, it's all... - Hey, we're gonna get you some help, okay? We're gonna get the helicopter, it's gonna take you home, okay? - You better send her a medic right now. - How did this happen, guys?! - You better send her a medic right now! Do you hear me? - Tell me how this happened! - (Man) We're gonna get you one. - We need to know. - This is not part of... - How can you guys just stand there?! Get some fucking help! You know, I don't know how long she was there, but none of you motherfuckers did anything. You didn't help her. You didn't call any help. That's bullshit. (Carolina) Oh, my God, we gotta take her! Let's take her quick! You guys! Let's get her-- Lift her up! (Panting) Guys, hold that leg up. Hold that leg up. Stop fucking shooting and help us! (Johnny) Hold the leg up. Hold the leg up! - (Neeko) Get it up. Get it up. - (Johnny) Hold the leg up! - It needs to be above her heart! - (Sam) By the ankle. By the ankle. - (Neeko) Watch this branch. - (Carolina) Careful with her head. (Johnny) Which bed are we taking her to? (Carolina) To the left. The first one to the left here. - Okay. - (Carolina) Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. - (Esther) Oh, my God. - Esther, get some pillows. Get some pillows. We need to put her leg up. Sam, careful. Hold her leg. - What happened? - (Sam) She got hurt, that's what. (Esther) Did she just twist her ankle or something? No, she got a damn spike in her leg. I had no idea what had gone on, what had happened, I just saw blood everywhere, and she was in a really bad way. Oh, my God. We-- we need something. We need something. We need a first aid kit. Sam, get-- get some water. Get some, like, boiled water. Annie! Annie, get some bandages or something. (Daniel) This is really bad. The whole thing. 'Cause I immediately started thinking, (Voice breaking) I don't know how she's gonna... go on without... real help. Is she gonna be okay? I don't know, man. She's hurt pretty bad. Guys, I don't know what she's thinking right now, but I don't think she wants to go home. She was that injured, screaming in pain. She didn't want to go. She's gotta go, man. She needs a doctor. - Yeah. - She can't stay here. I know, but we can't do what we did with Victoria. We can't force her. I mean, all we can do is explain to her that her injury is too serious. (Exhales) God, I don't know what to do. But right now she's not thinking straight. She's gonna die, man. She's gotta get some help. (Exhales) Where are the medics? (Johnny) We don't have anything here. We can't take care of her. (Crickets chirping) Oh! Oh. (Sabina) Don't be afraid. (Branch rustles) Wait. Wait! Did you see her? (Breathing deeply) (Carolina) Hold onto this tight, Irene, so you can pressure something tight. - Oh, my God. - Hey. Irene, what have you done? Listen. Listen, no one would blame you if you went home. - (Muttering indistinctly) - Irene? Honey. No one would blame you. (Weakly) I can't. You need to go and get some help. - Hey-- - I'm not. I'm not going home. Irene, you have... You can't stay here like this, though, Irene. You're hurt really, really badly. I can't. _ (Esther) I mean, Irene has a hole through her leg, and she still wants to stay. This is... I don't know. She's... she's stronger than I ever... than I ever could be. It's all right. This is really bad, man. - Yeah, it's bad. We can't do anything. - Yeah. - That leg might be broken. - Maybe we could patch her up and she'd be all right. - Where's our help? - If her leg's broken, it doesn't matter. She might have bone fragments and stuff. - We can't do that, you know? - We gotta do somethin'. What matters more is we need some kind of antibacterial cream, or it's gonna get infected. And that's gonna be fatal. (Johnny) I'm not a doctor, - but that sounds right, man. - Yeah. We was faced with this one problem again, the same thing we had with Victoria-- do we leave her here, or do we force her to go to the... to the safe zone? (Sam) The only way she's gonna get help - is if she leaves. - We gotta get her to a helicopter. 'Cause they're obviously not helping us here. - Well, then somebody-- - They haven't helped any of us. Anytime that we've had-- had something go wrong, or somebody gets hurt, they haven't done shit. (Sam) The camera guys don't have any medical supplies? (Johnny) No, they say they don't have anything. - (Neeko) How is she? - (Sam) Is she okay? She's not good. (Johnny) Is she conscious still? (Esther sniffles) (Crying) She's... She's-- she's not good. She's in so much pain right now, she's just saying that... she doesn't... she doesn't want to go. She just wants to stay strong. She doesn't want to fail, she's saying. (Esther) It's not fair. (Sam) She's not thinking clear, either. She doesn't deserve to go like this. (Johnny) No, she doesn't, but it's a life-or-death situation, you know? You gotta think about that. So maybe if one of us pushed the button, the helicopter will come, there'll be medics there. Whoever pushes the button's off the show. (Esther) I'll push it. (Sniffles) (Esther) I'm gonna push the button. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm sure. (Sniffles) She's my friend, and I just... I just... I didn't do anything to help her, and I--I think... I'm not playing this stupid game anymore. I don't care about the money, and I... She's my friend, and if I can help her, then I wanna do it, so... (Sighs and speaks indistinctly) (Door creaks) (Sighs) (Sam) That was genuine. (Neeko) I can't believe this is happening. (Esther) You know, I feel pissed enough about the way that I've treated her, and I just think, you know, I don't want to continue to play the game. So I'm happy to do it, and I... It's... it's the only solution, anyway. No one's coming to help us, so... (Annie) Esther said she'd go press the button even if that means she's disqualified. I don't think anybody expected her to do something like that. (Sniffles) But... I don't know. People change out here. ♪ (Latch clinks, door opens) (Daniel) When's this thing gonna get here? I mean, how long's it gonna take? Hey. Thanks for the shirt. We found something else to use. (Sam clears throat) (Sam) I can't do this anymore. (Johnny) You serious? You mean, like, the game? This is a dangerous place. You're quitting? People are dying. Getting injured. We got no recourse. We got no support. I feel helpless. I'm of no use to anybody here. I want to be able to help, but I can't. (Neeko) It's Esther. - What are you doing back? - Hey, where's the help? They didn't send anybody? There's a helicopter here and they're gonna fly her out. They didn't know anyone was hurt, so it's just the pilot. What the... How did they not know it's her? They have the camera guys here. I don't know. The helicopter's here, and the pilot said we just gotta get her to the helicopter, and they're gonna fly her to a hospital and get her the help that she needs. So we gotta get her to the helicopter. - (Sam) We can't cross the line. - (Johnny) Yeah. - How's she gonna walk there? She can't walk. - No, it-- it's fine, guys. The rules have changed, okay? They said she needs medical attention. So we just gotta get her to the helicopter. No one is disqualified, 'cause I've already pressed the button. Hey? - What did they say? - Well, guys, we're wasting time. You-- you wanna get her the help, or not? - That's good enough for me. - (Sam) The camera guy said it's cool. (Carolina) Hold this tight. It's gonna help you. (Door opens) (Johnny) Hey, Irene? We got you some help, all right? _ I don't want to leave. - (Esther) No, no. You don't have to. - You don't have to. You don't have to leave. They're just gonna take you to the hospital. You're gonna get your leg all fixed up. - And they said that you can come back. - (Daniel) Mm-hmm. (Irene) But someone has to go push the button. (Neeko) Esther pushed the button for you. (Esther) I wanted to go anyway. I'm ready. Okay? You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right, Irene. I'm gonna fly with you. - (Johnny) Okay, come on, guys. - We gotta move. - (Sam) Let's go. Move. Move. - (Johnny) We've gotta get her out of here. - (Irene gasping) - (Esther) Careful. Careful, guys. - (Johnny) I know. Excuse me. - (Esther) Be careful. - (Irene) Mm! Mm! Aah! - (Johnny) I know. It's gonna hurt. - (Esther) Oh... - (Johnny) I know it's gonna hurt. - (Sam) You got her? - We gotta get you some help, though. - Aah! Aah! - You're all right. You're all right. - (Breathing sharply) - Someone grab her right hand... (Daniel) You're okay. (Sam) Wanna get the right side? (Johnny) Still gotta keep that leg up, guys. - Keep her leg up. There we go. - Aah! Aah! (Esther) Careful. You're all right. (Johnny) You're all right. (Carolina) You're gonna be okay, Irene. (Breathing deeply) (Esther) You'll be better in no time. (Johnny) We're gonna get you to the helicopter. They're gonna fly you, okay? (Crying) _ _ Other than a big hole in your leg, have you got anything else to remember this experience by? Oh, my God, my rock. (Esther) What? My-- my rock. I left it back at the camp. - I can go get it. - Yeah. Oh, no. No. Don't worry. You stay with her. I'll run. (Johnny) - Just hold her leg. - When did she get so nice? Hey? Hey, are you here? Hey! Ho! Oh! Oh! Oh... what is that, huh? Oh... (Mutters) Oh! Oh! He's a weirdo, man. He's a straight-up weirdo. Yo, bro, what are you doing? Miljan. I wanna remember this day. (Neeko) For what? It's for Irene. That's gonna get infected. Miljan is... He's completely off his rocker. He... he is insane. (Neeko) You got issues, man. You need to check yourself. - All right. I'm gonna go. - That's so gross. It's just a tattoo. It's nothing weird. I was doing a tattoo with a razor. - (Irene moans) - (Johnny) Come on, y'all. I think it's right around the corner. - I think it's right here. - (Sam) You're all right. (Sam) Put her here. Put her down. Put her down. - Put her down. - Where the-- where's the fucking helicopter? (Sam) She said the helicopter-- She said the helicopter's gonna be here. - It should be here right now. - She said it was here. Where's the fucking helicopter? Where's the fucking helicopter?! (Carolina) Oh, my God. - Oh... - Did it come? - Fucking cunt! - What? - What? What?! - What?! Where do you think Esther is? She's not fucking here! She fucking tricked us! Fuck! Damn it! She went to get your rock. (Laughs) - She went to get your rock. - (Johnny) Oh, my God, man. I can't believe you. I can't believe you would do this. Well, you should be thanking me. Neeko, I just got rid of five contestants in one hit. Who are you, anyway? (Sam) She played us. She played the game better than any of us, and she won. She got us to cross the line, making believe that she did. She played us pretty good. We don't get any fucking money! She tricked us into crossing the line! She didn't press the fucking button! (Daniel) Oh, no. (Sam) She fucking played us. - God. Oh, that stupid bitch. I'm gonna kill her. - She won. - Game's over. - I'm gonna fucking kill her. She won. (Johnny) It really took every... every ounce of me not to go back to the camp and rip her head off, you know? I'm all about no rules, you know, play the game, trick people, whatever. But, man, that wasn't right. Not with Irene hurt like that. Are you okay? - (Clicks) - Where is this helicopter? (Daniel) Johnny. - (Sam) Coaxial doesn't have any wire. - What? - Power source. - There's no wire in the coaxial. - There's no what? - There's no wire. - (Daniel) This doesn't do anything. - It's empty. It's useless. What the fuck is this thing? (Daniel) It's a prop. What the-- What the fuck is going on here? We got a-- We're told from the very beginning there's a button. If anybody wants to leave, just push the button. - It's got no electrical power. There's no-- - What the fuck is this thing? What the fuck is this thing?! (Daniel) It's just a prop. A prop. What the fuck is this thing, man? - Grab his radio. - Huh? Grab his radio! Grab his radio! (Man) Do not touch me. - (Johnny) What? - (Sam) Hey, come here! (Both grunting) You shouldn't do it! (Man) Hey, get off me, man. (Man shouts indistinctly) (Johnny) Want that camera up your ass, man? (Man speaks indistinctly) This fucking thing's not worth it, man! - (Man) My job... - (Sam) Your job?! Your job's gonna get you fucking killed, motherfucker! Come in! We have a fucking emergency! Fuck! (Indistinct shouting) What kind of game is this?! You all don't know nothing? Huh? _ (Sam) Cameramen said they don't know anything. They're just told to shoot. Basically, it's just a paycheck to them. Do you-- do you know anything? Y'all-- y'all really know what the hell's going on? And apparently, y'all don't. Y'all are in kind of in the same boat we are. We gotta get this radio working. I mean, what is-- Is this a prop, too? Why is this thing-- Why is no one answering? _ (Carolina) Don't they come every day and do runs for you guys? _ They know we're here. They're gonna send somebody. - Isn't that the way it goes? - (Johnny) Yeah. - We gotta get Irene help now. - (Johnny speaks indistinctly) We don't have that kind of time, man. I think we should just go to base camp. What the hell's this base camp? The producers, they have, like, this base camp set up where they-- they're there, and they have their monitors and see us. - All right. Well, let's go. Where is this thing? - Now hold on a sec. - It's just over the valley. - Wait. Wait, though. We can't carry her through all that. (Sam) You guys go. I'll stay with her. If the helicopter comes, I'll make sure she gets on. - All right. - All right. All right, let's go. We'll get to camp. We'll send the helicopter over. It'll be faster that way, okay? So Joyce, you know, she says she knows where it is. So we're like, well, let's go there, maybe we can get some help, actually talk to these guys face-to-face. You know, get in contact with somebody. (Irene) Just go. Irene, I want you to take this, okay? In case it gets cold. If it gets cold, put it on. I'll be right back for it, okay? - Guys, are you coming or-- - Let's go! - I'm coming! - We gotta go! (Sam) Be careful. - Keep you warm. - Thank you, Sam. (Gunshots in distance) Hey. Tell me somethin'. You have something to do with this? With what? With this little trick that Esther played on us to get us off the show? (Scoffs) You really think I'd have something to do with that? Damn right. Give me a break. You know what? It's through these woods. Right through there. Come on. All right. Hey, thanks for your help, fellas. (Carolina) It's right over that hill. (Irene) All of you guys are off the show, and it's because of me. No, no. It's not your fault. You see, Esther, she played the game better than we did. She tricked us. It's not your fault. Yeah, but if I didn't get injured, then she would never have tricked you. ♪ (Carolina) I think we're here. This is it, guys. What the hell, guys? Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com
