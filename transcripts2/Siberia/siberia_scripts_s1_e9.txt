 Wait a second. Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. - (Sabina) What? - (Annie) Natalie. That's Natalie. No! I'm not gonna leave her.

 Esther! Annie! Sabina, I think we're lost. I don't think they made it back. ♪ (Sam) Hey, your heart stopped. (Johnny) When I was up there, I saw a building or something. (Johnny) Hey! The sign says it's a Russian science institute. (Daniel) Why isn't anybody here? (Rustling) Hello? (Johnny) Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? It's just the wind. What was it? It's just the wind. (Sam groaning) Sam, I got jackets. Oh. Thank you, brother. (Daniel) Mm-hmm. - (Sam) Oh, you're a doll. - Yeah. (Joyce muttering indistinctly) - (Clicking) - (Daniel) Yeah. - (Joyce) Here's this. - (Sam) Oh, thanks, doll. There's no power, guys. (Johnny) There's gotta be a phone in here, right? - Uh... - You know? I doubt it, man. This place is so remote. (Johnny) How do they communicate with people? (Daniel) I'd say look for a radio. (Johnny) Is that a radio? (Clattering) (Joyce) It's not even plugged in. (Sam) It's not attached. (Johnny) We gotta find a radio. You guys good? Salut. I'll stay with him. - (Daniel) Let's go. - (Johnny) We'll check it out. - (Thud) - (Daniel) Oh, shit. You all right, dude? (Johnny) Hey, turn your light on. Turn your light on. Your light. Your light. Yes. (Daniel) Whoa. - You think we can drag this out of here, or... - Look out, dude. Look out. (Daniel) Oh. Yeah. (Johnny) I don't know. - We gotta find the radio first, though. - (Daniel) Yeah. First things first, man. (Daniel) Come over here, man. (Door opens) - (Daniel) Get that camera-- - (Johnny) Hey, light. Light. (Daniel) Flashlights, man. Dude, look. (Johnny) Sweet. Awesome. - See a radio? - No. This is a security room. (Johnny) Why wouldn't they have a radio in the security room? (Daniel) 'Cause that's not-- it's a security room. - (Thud) - Oh. Johnny, there's another door. - (Johnny) Huh? - (Daniel) There's another door over here. (Lock rattling) (Daniel) Why would it be locked? (Johnny) There's probably something in there they don't want other people getting to. (Daniel) Maybe Sam can read this. (Johnny) Shh. (Neeko) Esther! Annie! Neeko, they're not here. - They're gone. - They should have been here by now. - They're gone. - Then we have to keep looking for them. No! We have to defend our-- (Rustling) - (Loud shriek) - Get inside. Fast. Get inside. Go, go. They're out there. They know we're here. Who's out there? - I don't know. - What did you see? I... wait, wait, wait. The only way we do this... We have to find the gun. - We've already looked for the gun. - We have to-- I know. We have to-- Shh. Quiet. Quiet, quiet. (Latch clicks) (Doorknob turns) - (Door closes) - Miljan! Where have you been? (Breathing heavily) They took her. ♪ Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com (Johnny) Hey. - You guys found flashlights. - Yeah. (Johnny) We still didn't find a radio, though. - You see any keys? - No. There's some locked doors in there. - No. - Check out the other building, too. No? - No, we didn't find any keys. - Okay. - Got another flashlight. - What are you guys looking for still? (Johnny) A radio. We need to find it. (Joyce) But there's no power. What are you gonna do? (Johnny) She's right. There's no power. - How are we gonna use the radio with no power? - It'll be battery-powered. It's fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. - It should be. Do you wanna come with? No, I'm gonna stay with Sam. You sure? You'll be all right? Yeah. - Let's go. - (Daniel) Yeah. Just be careful, guys. (Miljan) They chased me. (Neeko) Who chased you? I don't know who they are. I was in the middle of the woods trying to hide behind trees. It was freezing. - And I didn't know what to do. - Did you see Esther or Annie? - No. - (Sabina) What about Irene? What happened to Irene? They took her. I told you 150 times. - They took her. - (Sabina) Who, "They"? (Miljan) Hit me. Hit me. Go ahead. Hit me right in my face. - Why don't you do it? - Look at me. Talk to me. Talk to me. Why did you take her? (Miljan) He told me to. - Who? Who told you-- - He did. Who, "He," Miljan? I don't understand. Who? It's the... It's the voice that I hear in my head. - A voice tells me-- - The voice told you to take Irene, huh? Can you stop talking, please? He tells me what to do. And he said if I take her into the woods, she's gonna be okay. So that's what I did. I had to do it. - I took her in the middle of the woods-- - Okay, slow down. And I was standing next to her, and I noticed hundreds of footprints all over the place. And I heard this sound coming closer and closer to us. But I couldn't see anything, because fog was all over the place. I just felt them all around, all of them-- like, a lot of them-- coming closer and closer, surrounding us. So I had to run away. (Neeko) So you just left her there? I didn't have a choice. They're coming for us, guys. (Neeko sighs) They're gonna get us. One by one. (Daniel) Wanna break one of these? - (Johnny) Huh? - One of these windows. Let's go check on the porch so we don't have to climb so high. (Door creaks) (Johnny) Yeah, let's do this one. Can you hold that for me? All right. (Door opens) - Guys... - (Johnny) God. I found some keys in my pocket. - (Johnny) Yeah? - Yeah. - (Keys jingle) - Here. Yeah. - Well... - Oh, God. (Johnny) Is it the bottom lock, you think? (Daniel) No. I think this one might be it. (Joyce) I have a weird feeling about this. (Johnny) Why? What are you talking about? We're fine. (Joyce) I don't know. - We'll be fine, Joyce. - (Daniel gasps) That was quick. (Joyce) Oh, God, it stinks. (Johnny) Light switch don't work. - (Daniel coughs) - (Joyce) What is this place? (Daniel) I don't know. Sam said it's, like, a research center. (Loud clatter) - (Joyce) Fuck, Daniel! - (Daniel) Sorry. Sorry. - Sorry. - What do you mean, "Sorry"? (Johnny) Maybe try the keys on those. (Daniel) Keys? (Johnny) Yo, Daniel, come here. - (Daniel) What? - (Joyce) Is this it? (Johnny) I think I found it. Is this it? (Daniel) Yeah. (Johnny) All right. (Daniel) Jeez, this thing is... - (Johnny) How do we turn it on? - (Daniel) ...ancient. (Joyce) Okay, so call someone, Daniel. Daniel, does it work, or not? (Daniel) I don't know. (Switch clicks) I don't see anything... Hold on. Let me get around here. (Johnny) See if there's any wires anywhere. (Daniel) Dude, this thing is like 80 years old. It's not battery powered. I thought this-- I thought the radio was battery powered. This is gonna take a major power source to power. - (Joyce) So it doesn't work? - (Daniel) Well, we need power. - Damn it. - So let's get out of here, guys. Come on. Let's go. (Joyce) Oh, my God. What the hell happened here? (Daniel) Looks like a robbery. (Daniel) Joyce. - Is that a bullet case? - Yeah. (Joyce) Why are there bullets? Where's Johnny? - Johnny! - (Clinks on table) (Johnny) This whole room is shot up, guys. - (Joyce) Oh, my God! Aah! - (Loud clatter) (Johnny) - What? What? What is it? (Daniel) - What? Fuck. (Daniel) Is he shot? Johnny-- - (Johnny) Stay back. Stay back. - Is he dead? Is he dead? (Joyce) Guys, I think we should get out of here. We should go back to Sam. Let's just go back. - (Johnny) Let me just check this out. - (Daniel) Yeah, we will. We will. (Daniel) Wait a second. (Clinks) Johnny, I found the breaker. - (Johnny) Yeah? - (Daniel) Yeah. Turn 'em on. - (Grunts) - (Clicks) (Power whirring) - (Pops) - (Daniel) What-- - (Joyce) What happened? - Joyce, stay there. - What else is in there? - (Johnny) Don't come in here. We gotta get out of here, okay? - What else is in there? - Let's just leave. Nothing. - What's in there? - Let's leave. - What else did you see? (Sabina) We have to try again. That's our only chance. If we don't find a gun, we have zero chances. Even if it's out there, how we gonna go find it in the woods now, huh? I know. It's pitch dark. The only thing, I suggest, we can do is try and protect ourselves. We need to get, like, a fire burning or something. 'Cause if there is something out there, that will ward them off. We need torches. - How we gonna get-- - Like a torch line around a settlement. If an animal approaches, it will stay away, but if it's a human, we'll see them before they see us. (Miljan) That's not gonna help. It's not a human. Or an animal. Whatever we do tonight, we're dead. (Sabina exhales) So tell me about the bodies. (Johnny) Let's... Let's not talk about the dead bodies right now. Let's just get some rest. We'll recharge. (Daniel) We don't have time to rest. We need to be rescued. (Sam sighs) Daniel, tell me about this, uh, breaker box. There's nothing to tell. It... It worked for a second, and then it shorted out. (Sam) Okay. Well, there's gotta be a breaker box somewhere here. If there was one in that building, there's probably one in this building, right? Let's take a walk. Have a flashlight? Want to go fishing? - (Daniel) Okay. - Let's go. (Ripping) (Tapping) (Sabina) We'll barricade the door. Do you think that it's gonna work? (Sabina) It has to. (Miljan) They are watching us. Oh, my God. They're so close. Bro, if you got nothing constructive to say, shut the hell up. - (Miljan) I'm not afraid of you, Neeko. - Seriously. I'm only afraid of what's out there. Sabina, you got it secure? Huh? (Daniel) Sam, I didn't mention it, but the radio's in the other building, so... if we get the power going in here, that's not gonna help us. (Sam) All right, well, we just bring it over, we'll hook it up. (Daniel) It's from World War II. It probably weighs a couple hundred pounds. That thing's huge, Sam. (Sam) What the hell was that? - Huh? - (Daniel) I don't know. (Sam) Do you see it? (Daniel) Unh-unh. It's probably just a rat. (Sam) I don't like rats. (Sam) I think I got something here. - (Clattering) - Whoa! That was no wind. What the hell was that? (Daniel) I don't know. - (Sam) Huh? - (Daniel) I don't know. (Sam) What are you doing? What are you doing? (Daniel) Hello? (Sam) It says "Laboratory." It's got a lock. Forget about it. Come on. (Daniel) I got keys. I got keys. (Keys jingle) (Under breath) I can't believe we're doing this. (Loud clatter) Daniel. Daniel? - You got a lot of keys there. - (Clicks) Let's go. (Neeko) Sabina, we've already looked. Then we didn't see it. (Neeko) It's the same map. Something else. It's not that simple. (Neeko) Sabina, all we have to do is follow the directions. - There's the X. The guys should have been there. - Just... We're wasting our time. Why do you keep reading that fucking book? Because it's mine, and I'll do whatever I want with it. Oh, so now you read Russian, huh? I don't have to. And what's that supposed to mean? Are we friends now? Should we get coffee and discuss my book content with you? - No, we're not friends. - Neeko. - What? What? What you gonna do? - I'm warning you. - (Miljan) Give me that back right now. - (Neeko) Do something. Do something! Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop! Come here. Come here. Come here. I think I got it. Look. Look. Look, look, look. We're here. We're in women's cabin. This is men's cabin. You fold the map... The arrow points at men's cabin. - (Miljan) So what? - It's at men's cabin. - Sabina, we've already looked. - It's-- No, I know. Wait. - I have to check. - We looked everywhere. - We're wasting our-- - We have to check. We missed something. Hold up. (Neeko) Yeah, but, Sabina, we would have found it already. (Sabina) Shh. Be quiet. Shh. Shh. (Neeko) What is it? Run! I knew it. I knew it. - (Sabina) Miljan! Come on! - (Neeko) Miljan, get inside! - (Sabina) Run, Miljan! - (Neeko) Come on! Move! Get up! Get inside! Move! Get in! Lock the doors. Barricade the doors. Watch the windows. In here. (Neeko) Put the camera down and look. (Sabina) Come on. I know it's gotta be here. Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on! (Neeko) I'm telling you, Sabina, it's not in here. (Whispers indistinctly) Shut it! - (Sabina) Wait. Wait. - (Miljan) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - (Sabina) Wait! - (Miljan speaks indistinctly) (Sabina) I got it! - (Neeko) Watch the door. Watch the door. - (Miljan) What? - (Sabina) I got it. - (Neeko) No, no, put it out. (Miljan speaks indistinctly) - Oh-ho-ho-ho! - It's a double wall! (Sabina grunts) - (Wood cracking) - (Miljan) It was next to my bed. (Neeko) You got it? - Move! - (Miljan shouts) Open the door. Open that door. (Miljan) Take it down. (Sabina) Get away. (Fires shot) - Close the door. - (Door closes) Miljan, watch that window. Neeko, watch that one. Tell me if you see the movement. - Do you see anything? - (Sabina) Shh. Just shut up. Shut up. (Sam) Danny, why are we here? (Daniel) Let's just find a breaker and we'll get out of here. (Sam) I'm looking around. I don't see any breakers. What the hell are we doing here, Daniel? - Why did you drag me here? - For breakers. - We're looking for breakers. - Yeah. (Sam) What the hell did they do to these animals? (Daniel) They're all mutated. (Sam) They're doing some kind of experiments in here, Daniel. And I don't want to be part of anybody's experiment. Does this-- does this not bother you at all? - (Daniel) Well, go. - (Sam) Huh? Whoa. (Whispering indistinctly) - What the hell is it? - I don't know. (Sam) It's been skinned. (Daniel) Just keep looking for a breaker. - I don't know. - Don't do that. - (Sam) What the hell is that? - (Daniel) It looks all dead. (Sam) Dead? (Scrape, clatter) (Sam) What the fuck is that? There's something in there. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna check it out. What-- Wait a second. Hold on a second. (Daniel) It's in a cage. (Sam) Daniel... Well, how do you know it's not gonna get out of the cage? (Daniel) I don't. (Sam) Holy mackerel, it's a bird. (Daniel) It's a falcon. - (Sam) It's a falcon? - Yeah. Why would there be a falcon in here? I don't know. Why is any of this stuff in here? (Sam) It's the only thing in here that looks normal. (Daniel) Sam, come here. What are you-- what are you doing? (Daniel) Atomic clocks. (Sam) I don't care about clocks. Got all these freaky things in here, and you're worried about clocks? Let's get out of here. Come on. These are off. Maybe later on tonight you can explain it to me. But right now, I don't wanna talk about it. - (Johnny) What's up, guys? What was that noise? - Hey. - Huh? - (Sam) What's that? (Johnny) That noise. What was that? (Sam) Well, you ever been to a freak show at a circus? No. - (Sam) We just did. - (Johnny) What? There was a falcon in there. There was also some atomic clocks there, actually. What the hell's an atomic clock? I won't get into it. I already tried to explain to Sam. Didn't make any sense to me. So did you find the breaker? I mean... We're off the grid here. We're in a remote area, you know? I think the source of power is gonna come from a genny, from a generator. - All right. - We find a generator, we get that going... (Daniel) Where would they have that? - What's that? - Where would they have that? It's definitely gonna be outside, not inside. Kid won't give up. I know. - I got this one. - No, no. I've worked on gennys before. I know what I'm doing. You sit this one out. All right. So what's a generator look like? Well, the motor's gonna be in some kind of a metal box, some casing. We can check those buildings out. Yeah. I'm gonna look over here. (Daniel) Is this it? - I think this is it. - (Metal clangs) (Sam) Hold on a second. Yep. That's our generator. Looks like a hundred years old. How do you turn it on? (Sam) That's our gas... That's the main switch. Let's check it out. - (Switch clicks) - All right. It's empty. We need gas. Listen, it's got a... - It's got a primer hose. - Okay. So we're gonna need some kind of a can. Uh, are these different? Huh? I think these are different. (Sam) Uh... yep. They are. Um... that's-- that's diesel. That's gas. That's what we need. We need the gas. (Daniel) Are you sure? How come that-- - (Daniel) Whoo. - All right, put that down. Hold this? - Okay. - Give me some light. (Sam) Okay. Right here. (Daniel speaks indistinctly) (Sam) Yeah, that's probably enough. (Daniel) When can we try it? (Sam) Just give it a couple seconds. All right. This is gonna take two steps. First I'm gonna turn the key. - (Clicks switch) - (Grunts) (Sam) All right. (Engine starts) (Daniel) Oh, that's gotta be good, right? - (Sam) Oh, that's very good. - Sam, is that good? (Sam) Oh, yeah. Beautiful. You ready? - Yep. - Here goes nothing. (Clicks) (Daniel) Holy fuck. (Power whirring) - (Sam) Whoo! - (Daniel) Whoo-whoo! (Both laugh) - (Kisses) - (Daniel) Oh! Whoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! (Sam) Whoo! (Neeko) Are you okay, Sabina? (Sabina exhales) You want to switch? (Groans) No. (Miljan) I hope Irene is okay. (Joyce) Oh, my God. (Johnny) How'd you guys get it going? Huh? - Where did you guys find-- - (Sam) It's outside. Outside. (Joyce) So how do we get it... How do we get it to work? - This is the tuner right here. - Hello? - The power's on. - (Joyce) Johnny, do you think it's jammed? - I mean, I don't know if a radio can be jammed. - We should be hearing something. - I mean, you just gotta-- I don't know. - (Sam) It's not jammed. It's not jammed. (Johnny) The power's on. Okay. I know that. - We gotta find a frequency that works, and... - So what's happening? It's not that. We're not getting a signal. - (Joyce) Okay. So-- so... - (Sam) There's no signal. We have power. - Look, it's lit up. - (Johnny) Hello. Hello. (Joyce) Okay, so keep-- keep moving buttons and see if we find a signal on something. - (Johnny) Look... look for a... - Guys, I know what the problem is. I know what the problem is. Hey. I know what the problem is. - (Johnny) All right. - (Joyce) What is it? - (Johnny) What? - (Joyce) Oh, my God. That's the beacon. What did that? (Sam) What happened to it? Could it-- could it have been the wind or something? (Daniel) The wind, Sam? Look at this thing. (Johnny) No way wind did this. - Guys, I want to go inside. It's so cold. - But why? Why would somebody do that? I want everyone to know that I am not crazy. There is something in these woods. I don't know why Sabina and Neeko are ignoring what I'm telling them. And they don't believe me. I don't expect them to understand, but they know something weird is out there. They saw the strange footprints, they heard sounds so many times before. (Sniffles) And they don't believe me. So whatever happens, I want everybody to know that I'm not crazy. (Exhales) Today, just trying to get some stuff done. Um, trying to find ways to get the hell out of here. Uh, yeah, Daniel, he's in the other building, trying to put, uh, put together a computer. And, you know, hopefully, uh, we can get some e-mails out, or, I mean, call somebody from the internet. - (Door opens) - (Sighing) (Johnny) Oh, God. It reeks. Figure that thing out? (Daniel sighs) I'll try. Everything's so damaged. (Johnny) Yeah? (Daniel) Yeah. I think I can get it working, though. You need any other tools? You got everything you need? (Taps twice) (Daniel) Yeah. I should be all right, man. I mean, just... (Mutters indistinctly) (Sighs) Uh, this is gonna take some time, man. Hey, Daniel. Come here. Come over here. Check this out. (Daniel) Okay. (Daniel) It's a map, man. I know. If that's where we were, then we... we must have been going around in circles. Is that a town? It's a fucking town. That's not far. How far is that? - That is pretty close. - We might be able to walk to that. I think you're right. (Sighs) Well, we can't walk to that. Why not? It's like 200 kilometers away. How-- how far is that in miles? (Daniel) It's about 124. (Johnny exhales) (Sabina) I have no idea where they are, if they're coming with help or not. It's... I don't know. (Sam) That first cup of coffee tasted like shit. (Chuckles) Still, it was the best damn cup of coffee I ever had in my life. (Joyce) It's a bit surreal. We're in this place in the middle of nowhere. Hopefully, we can... (Inhales, exhales) get to Irene and the others before it's too late. I know they did have some food that we left from the producers' camp. The girls disappeared. And, I mean, they're probably... I don't know. They're probably dead by now. (Neeko) I'm thinking about my own family. My brother. I start to question myself as things get worse. Am I ever gonna get home? (Johnny) Everything that's happened... you know, for being reasons why we're all alive now is just luck. (Joyce) They do have shelter at the settlement, but I don't know if Irene is gonna make it... if somebody doesn't show up quick. (Door opens) What's up? What you up to? (Sam clears throat) Just trying to read the paper. - Yeah? - Yeah, it's... It's kind of tough. - (Chuckles) - What are you doing? Uh, I just left Daniel, man. He's still in that room, working. I don't know how he's doing it. Disgusting in there. Yeah, that's gotta be tough. But, uh, he'll get it done. He's a smart kid. He'll figure it out. Anyways, uh, you seen Joyce? - (Sam) Hmm? - You seen Joyce? Uh, yeah, about an hour ago. Sleeping quarters. Brought her some coffee. - All right. - Yeah. (Johnny) All right. Joyce? I don't think so. (Shivering) Guys, I'm starving. Is there any food here? (Neeko) We're all hungry. There's nothing left. - (Sabina) It's pretty clear. - We can't stay here. It's clear now. We can try. (Jet whooshing) Did you hear that? Wait. (Jet whooshes overhead) (Neeko) It's a plane! It's a plane! - (Miljan) Let me out! - (Sabina) Oh! (Jet whooshes past) Hey! - (Neeko) Hey! - (Miljan) Hey! (Whooshes) - (Miljan) Hey! - (Neeko) Hey! - (Miljan) Here! (Jet whooshes past) (Neeko) Maybe it'll come back around again. (Miljan) Yeah, right. We're probably this big in their eyes. (Neeko) Well, if that was a search party, why... No, those were fighter jets. They can't see you. They will never see you. - It's not a rescue party. - Of course not. We're in the middle of nowhere. (Neeko) So what are we gonna do? Maybe they're gonna come back around again. - (Miljan) Get back inside. - (Sabina) We need some kind of signs. - Like, signs-- like, SOS signs. - (Miljan) So what signs? (Miljan) How do you wanna do that? - Like, pee on the snow? - Out of wood logs. So if they come back, they see us. (Daniel) I keep thinking about Irene and the others. What if they die because we can't get help in time? I'm not a hero. So why am I trying to be one? (Pops) (Chuckles) Isn't it a little early for that? No, sir. Mmm. Good? Mm-hmm. (Laughs) You want some? Nah. I'm sober. (Sam inhales and exhales) You know, um... there's a town, uh, not too far from here. (Sam) Mm-hmm? Daniel and I looked at the map. Couple hundred kilometers or so. Was thinking, uh, go in the garage, see if we can get the cat going. We gotta find the keys, though. Check the ignition? No. (Door squeaks) (Johnny) Nah. They're not in here. - (Sam) No? - (Johnny) No. Check the, uh, check the floorboards. (Johnny) No luck. Do me a favor. Open... open that latch. (Johnny) What, you think the keys are in here or something, or what? I'm thinking maybe, uh... I could hot-wire this thing. You can hot-wire this thing? How do you know how to do that? (Sam) When I was a kid, I didn't buy cars, I took 'em. - (Chuckles) - Let me get over there. (Johnny) Okay. How's your foot? Thanks to you, I still got one. I never thanked you for saving my life. Let's see if we can get some tools or something. Yeah. What can I do to help? Ratchet set. Anything you can get your hands on. - All right. - Some strips of wire. (Neeko) Miljan. What are you looking at? - Nothing. - Come over and help me. What were you looking at? Nothing. Okay. Push this. Push it. - I'm pushing. - (Grunts) Okay. Can you lift it? Can you carry it? Will that be easier? (Miljan groans) Dude, it's not even heavy. Lift it. - Can you stop talking, please? - (Sabina) Shh! I'm trying to help you here. - Help me? You're making the job harder for me. Lift it. - You know what? How 'bout you just do it yourself? And stop telling me what to do. You're not boss around here. - Okay? - Are you serious? Now do it yourself! It's gonna be easier for you. - Sabina. - (Miljan) Ahh! - Can you give me a hand? - (Miljan) I'm hungry! I haven't got time for that guy. (Speaks indistinctly) Did you look around the torches? (Sabina) Yes. Yeah? And it was the exact same footprints. I know, Neeko. Let's keep moving. I hope the sign works. Let's do it. Okay. Oh, God. (Crying) I'm sorry. (Joyce crying) And I felt so bad, like I was stealing from a dead person. But we didn't have shoes or anything. I don't feel safe. I want to go home so bad. (Sabina) It's strange. Although it's not a game anymore, and we're sort of in it together, we're all surviving. It's still, you know, every man for himself. (Joyce) I think in life, we have so many ambitions and so... many things we want to do that we forget to stop and breathe and enjoy the moment. I should have enjoyed the simple moments that I miss so much right now. (Miljan) The world is not black and white. There's probably a plan behind it. Nothing happens here by accident. Everything happens for a reason. I actually believe in that. (Sam) You guys believe in synchronicity? You know, chance, fate? - Why things happen? - Yeah. Of course. How, uh, at the beginning of the show, the... the tall viking girl and the other guy, how they got thrown off, and how they could have been here. But they're not, we're here. Hindsight is 20/20. (Sam) Yeah. It sure is. What I'm trying to get at is... (Clears throat) just this whole thing about how one little change could just throw everything off. I shouldn't have been here. If Esther didn't, uh, move that flag and they got lost, I would have been the one thrown off the show, 'cause I'm the slowest runner. So I shouldn't be here. - (Footsteps) - (Johnny) I'm gonna kill her. Guys, the computer's working. - (Joyce) What? - Yeah. (Joyce) No way. All right. So I ran some port scans and some enumeration tests. Somebody did not want us to see... - Why don't you just cut to it? - ...whatever is on this computer. Just cut to it. I got through them, and look what I found. (Clicking mouse) (Joyce) What is that? (Sam) It's, um... it's footage from a... 1927 expedition. That's... see that guy right there? That's Leonid Kulik. (Joyce) Lik-- Isn't that the guy from... from Miljan's journal? (Sam) Yeah. They're, um, looking for a place where a whole bunch of people disappeared. Ta... Tu... Tunguska. (Johnny) Wait. Yo. Those are-- those are the trees that we saw, - when we were up on that ridge. - (Sam) Yeah. (Johnny) What caused that? They never found a cause. I don't know. (Door opens) (Miljan) Sabina! I found something. Come on. I wanna show you. (Neeko) What? (Miljan) Oh, you're gonna love it. Come. (Miljan) Look. - (Neeko) What is it? - Come on in. Oh, go ahead. Tell us, what is it? Hmm? (Sighs) It's not what it looks like. I'll help him out. That's actually food he was saving for his own ass while we are starving around-- isn't it? (Neeko) I wasn't holding for myself. - I was gonna share-- - Mm-hmm. Ah. You were gonna share. You were gonna ration it, but you hid it right next to the bed in this little box, and we asked if we have any food here, you said no. Is that true? - (Neeko) Trust me, I... - You disgust me. You're giving us moral speeches on how we need to take care of each other, how we need to share and ration, and you do this? This is the food Johnny stole from the shed. You're nothing but bully, man. - (Neeko) It's not-- - Get out of my way. - Put that back. - Oh, right. - (Neeko) Sabina, you have to believe me. - (Sabina) Mm... I wasn't gonna... I wasn't keeping it for myself. - I was gonna share it with you. - How could you do this? - Oh, not you. Not you. - Please, Sabina. Please. (Miljan) Guys? - What? What, again, Miljan? What? - (Miljan) Come out now. I'm tired of this shit. (Sabina gasps) (Static crackles) Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com Here's a look at what's coming up on Siberia. Here, on NBC.
