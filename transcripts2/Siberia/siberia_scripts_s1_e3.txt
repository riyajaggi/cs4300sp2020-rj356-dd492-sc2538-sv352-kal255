 Previously on "Siberia"... Your goal is to remain here until the end of winter. If you wish to leave, or if you need help, there is a safe zone with a button that will summon a helicopter. Once you cross the line of the safe zone, you are out and have forfeited the competition. That is the only rule. - Oh, my God! - Oh, my gosh. Yes!

 - Yes! - Take what you can grab, man. We're gonna ration it out. - We're gonna ration it out! - Who's "we"? Coming out here now and being thrown in this situation, I'm happy to take the leadership position. This is all we might have to last us till winter. I think it was an idiotic idea to ration it out. You guys are making a big mistake. "These mushrooms are poisonous unless boiled." I think they've been cooked. - I'm really hungry. - They're good, huh? Something's wrong with her. Her eyes are very dilated. It's just mass confusion right now.

 I don't think I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna go home. What exactly did you see? You guys are all gonna die. So I was in the woods, and I was thinking about Carolina, and, uh, what I could do to kind of start a little courtship. And, uh, I saw some flowers, and I, you know, figured, you know, every girl likes flowers. So I started picking some flowers, thought I'd... make a little nice bouquet or something. - Hey. - What are you doing there? What are you doing? You scared me. I thought something was there. Sorry, I just... nothing. Wouldn't you know it? Carolina Springs up on me... and I sure as hell wasn't gonna tell her what the hell I was doing, so I had to, you know, think quick on my feet. If you could have anything in the world right now to eat, what would it be? Mmm. I think I would have arroz con gandules. It's this rice-and-beans Latin thing. That sounds pretty good. I think I'd have to go with a big Texas ribeye - and some mashed potatoes and... - Medium or well? - Holy (Bleep). - Oh, my God. Oh, yeah! And the sun's out? - ___ - ___ Whoo! Whoo! You gotta come in now! Nice and warm. Yeah! Oh, my God! Yeah, I lied. It's not warm. It felt really good to finally be able to wash myself and feel clean and human again, 'cause I was so dirty, and... I loved it. It felt like a great relief. It was almost a sunshine of hope. Kiss her! Looked like Carolina and Johnny were about to kiss, but I think I spoiled it, so that was my bad. But, um... I think there's definitely a connection between those two. None of us had bathed yet, so it was a really nice moment for us. We needed a little bit of refreshment and something to sort of snap us back into a good frame of mind. Nope! Quit being such a hard-ass! Get in the water and take a bath! I don't know. I thought everyone kind of was nude as well, so I just... took it off. Yeah! Losing that dirty, grimy feel... how good is that? Oh, my! I'm not really competing with other guys for women. I'm not. But I know I can get any of them if I want. Aren't you guys all naked? You've just got to work with what you've got. Appreciate what you've got. And there's nothing better than skinny-dipping. It's not my thing to get naked on this show, so... good for her if she wants to do it. Maybe that's her strategy. It's slippery! Who's gonna jump? My children! I don't know, it's just not my type of thing. I just didn't feel comfortable with joining in to that party. I like watching you guys. - It feels so good, Irene. I promise. - Come in! Daniel, let's see your ! Come on! Carolina, por favor! Mucho caliente! They're here for fun. Seems a weird place to have fun. - Let's play a game. - Yes. - Oh, God. - All right? - That's actually a good idea. - Truth or dare. - Of course it is. - And I'm gonna start. - Natalia... - Yes? - How are you? - Good. How are you? - Truth or dare? - Mm, truth. What's your... favorite position? - What? - Oh, my God. I mean, yeah, sexually. Well, of course. Just to clarify. Just to make sure you understand. Are you blushing? I try them all. And you love them all? I'll take it. I'll take it. - Good answer. - Is it my turn then? - Okay. Irene, truth or dare? - No! I don't want to play. I'm not in this game. - Oh, come on! - No! - You have to play. - You can't sit around with us then. You have to play. - We're all... all into it. Okay, fine. Dare. Dare! Saucy. Take your time. I'm so scared. I think you should get up and dance for us. - Yeah! - Yes, I agree. And I'll get some music. Come on, that's harmless. I'm not very expressive, especially dancing, so at first I was... I was like, "no way." I'm not gonna dance in front of a bunch of people that I don't really know that well. - Slow. - Okay, slow. Yes, go slow. Yeah, Irene. Daniel is into Irene. I can see that. He stares at her. It's really creepy. I don't think he's gonna get any. Irene! Just for you tonight, ladies and gentlemen! - Bravo! - That was hot! - That was really classic. - That was hot. Guys! Big snap. - Fire in the woods, man. - What? - Fire in the woods. - What are you talking about? - There's a fire in the woods. Something's burning. - Seriously? - Really? - Yeah. - Come on. - What is it? - Right over there. - Are you sure? In the woods. I just saw it. It's right over there. What is that? - What is that? - Come on, come on. - (Bleep) - Come on, come on! Oh, my God! Damn it! Oh, my God! - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com - What are we gonna do? We can't do anything. We can't do anything. We gotta get some water. I told you this was a mistake! Gotta get water! Come on! We have nothing left to eat, guys. - We have nothing to eat. - What happened? We rationed it and put it in there. Huh? Somebody light this on fire? What happened? - You were here first. - I don't know! It was burning before I got here! But I saw you here first during the game. - You think I set this on fire? - No, no, no! - It's my food, too! - Guys, guys, guys. I didn't even want it in there! Don't accuse anyone. It will only hurt ourselves. We shouldn't be accusing each other. Glad we locked it in there. I hate to say it, but you're right. That's all we had, man. That's all we had. When I showed Neeko and Carolina there's still some, you know, really sad-looking food here... there was the rice that maybe could still be eaten. How many of these jars? There was, uh, I believe there was 28. - We counted 28 jars. - And 17 of the little ones? - Yes. - 'Cause I only count... I think there were 17, yeah. Seven... I only count, like, seven or eight or... 'cause it should be pretty obvious there should be a lot more glass around here. Was there a lantern inside the shack? - I didn't... - I don't remember seeing one. I found a kerosene lamp in the ashes. There aren't any kerosene lamps just laying around in the forest. That obviously came from our cabins. So somebody in our group started that fire. We're all hungry. Every time I think about that shed, it's just... just what a... what a waste. Now we're more pissed off than we were, I guess. Everyone's just having these little, like, bitch fights. Getting hungry, big boy? - Pardon me? - I said, you getting hungry, big boy? You can't touch the firewood anymore until I tell you to. - Right. - Oh, yeah. I'll let you know when you can do it. That's a good idea. That's thinking. You know... Who made you master of the universe? You're not as dumb as I thought you were. All right, I'll tell you what. Now you can do it. Go ahead. - I'm rationing. - Appreciate it. - I'm rationing. - Appreciate it. - I'm rationing. - Tell me it was a good idea to ration the food now. I told you before, if you got something to say, say it. I just said it. Neeko, I need to talk to you a second. - All right, man. - We don't have to take this, you know, Sam. Yeah, okay. - Hang on a second. What's up? - Thanks. Hey, mayor, get your second-in-command under control. Excuse me? Don't listen to him. Come on. I need to talk to you for a second. Everybody's hungry, and everybody reacts differently when they get hungry. - All right. - Just don't let this issue between you and Johnny... - from now on... from now... - Don't let Johnny get to you, though. Don't let him get to you. We're gonna get through this. Don't worry about it. - Like... - Oh, I know we're gonna get through it. We're gonna get through this fine. - We'd be a lot better off... - I know... everyone would be a lot better off... - We should've listened to you. - Just taking care of themselves. Now, listen, they gave us something. They raised our hopes. They set it on fire. They took it away from us. They're trying to play with our emotions... - Okay. - And our spirits right now. I can't worry about "they." I can only worry about "us." - I'm on your side. - I didn't say you weren't. We'll get through this. Hey, guys. Uh, I heard a bit of arguing this morning between certain individuals. I don't think, uh, it's the right state of mind that we should be in right now, because it's not gonna help. The food's gone. But right now, all I know is that we're hungry. We need to go out and find some more good. - I agree. - You know? And should we go buy a new lock so we can ration this food that we scavenge? Dude, you're not helping. You're not helping the situation. You didn't, either. I did... I suggested what I thought was best at the time. And made a bad decision. - It was a suggestion. - You made a bad decision. - A suggestion. - Admit it, you made a bad decision. No, I'm not gonna admit I made a bad... - I suggested... - How can you not admit... you... you're avoiding blame. You ain't even man enough to say you made a bad call. I didn't make any call. I just suggested... you didn't make any call? - No, I suggested... - How can you say that? - The right thing... - You took the lead, though. ... That we should ration it. Yeah. You made a bad decision. But you did take the lead on that decision. - Someone had to take the lead. - Right. - You guys were acting like... - Right. - So you made a bad call. - So why can't you just admit that maybe you were wrong? - The food's gone. You made a bad call. - Everyone's wrong sometimes. Listen, you guys wanna survive? Let's get some food. We got water. We can go out in the woods. I found a berry patch. We can get those mushrooms again. Who found the mushrooms the first day? - All right. - I'll look for more mushrooms. - Mushrooms... - We need to boil the water, though. And let's use the traps. We haven't used the traps since we've been here. Okay? He seemed really pissed off, and really pissed off at Neeko for making us keep all the food in the shed. And I feel a little... you know, pissed off at myself for just going along with that. It's like back to basics now. Hunger usually puts you to the edge. You never know what you're capable of. I've never been so hungry in my life. It attacks you not only, you know, your stomach, but your mind, you know? It... everyone's on edge, depressed. You know, that food that we... we could have had is constantly playing in our minds, 'cause we saw it. We knew what we could have had, and now it's gone. You know, it's just brang the whole... the spirit down of everybody. It's... it's a sad situation. It was just there in a tree, and I'm like, why... why would a speaker be in a tree in the middle of nowhere? It starts to really... fracture your mind. Like, I find myself getting angry at the smallest little things that people do. I am hungry, but... It's not a problem yet. Other people are really irritable, because they're not used to it. I hope they will start getting more serious and look for food instead of complaining. Hey. Can I ask you a favor? Sure. Can I borrow your pantyhose? Right by the camp, we got this stream, and there's fish in there. I seen 'em. So I asked Irene if I could borrow her pantyhose, thinking I'd use them as some kind of a net and just scoop 'em up. And one of these, but maybe, um... Yeah. Here. I'm kind of starving, you know? Maybe this will rectify the situation from last night. - Yeah. - That's what I hope. What is that? At least fix that one. - What is it? - Oh, it's a bow and arrow. A bow? - We can hunt now, at least. - That's great. Okay, who knows how to use that? You know, I've shot before in my days, but, uh, I'm no expert by any means, but... Um, so I... I bring it out and I start putting it together, and, uh, I figured I'd take a shot. Good job! It's harder than it looks, (Bleep). - Have you shot an arrow before? - I have before! Have you shot an arrow before, Sam? Uh... it's been a little while. Come on, Sam. Someone get him training wheels. He can't...  Oh, God. Yeah, that's real nice, Sam. Real nice. Same! I'm a lefty. It's rigged up for a rightie. - Oh, we're still gonna starve! - Oh, really? Nice. Yeah. I thought you could do anything, Sam. I thought you could do anything. 'Cause I said, it's rigged for a rightie. - I'm a lefty. - Oh. Okay. Sure. You gonna give me a hard time 'cause I... Yeah, I am. If you guys can't do it, I know I can't. We'll learn. That's all you got? We'll learn? Practice... How long is this gonna take us to learn? - Irene! - Irene! Looks like Irene's hunting! My dad has always wanted me to learn a bunch of skills that I... I never really was interested in, but... eventually, I'm just, like, you know, just to get him to stop nagging me, I'll take the classes. You do this before? Can you do it again? - Do it again. - Or was that a fluke? Do it again. Do it again. I'm shocked! Wait, wait. Give her... give her some quiet. - Let her concentrate. - Put you guys to shame. That's... She hit it right between the horns. I like that style. - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Irene! Irene knew how to shoot the bow. She didn't know anything about hunting. She's never killed an animal. Um, I've been hunting many times, so I figured I'd lend my expertise, and she'd lend her expertise to me, you know, kind of make a little trade. Uh, I think we should take that bow and, uh, me and you go out there and get an animal. Yes! Dinner! When I first told Irene, you know, come with me, we're gonna try and, you know, get some deer, she definitely was a little hesitant. I'm very reluctant about killing an animal, because I really like animals. I love anything that's alive, and I've never taken a life. What's up? I don't want to kill anything. You're the only one that can shoot. - Well... - I can't fire that thing. You've got to think of the bigger picture, okay? We're all starving. We've got nothing. It's just that we haven't got time right now to be getting cold feet about anything. We're out... what are we gonna do? - Okay. - Okay, you're gonna be fine, okay? All right. John. Take this. Awesome. Thanks. Looks like we got a knife to get a deer with. Well, I went fishing. Spent a while... didn't catch anything. Nice work, Sam. You're a real fisherman, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why don't you go, uh... go hug a tree? Come on, give him a break. I'm hungry! A man goes out to hunt, to fish, whatever, he wants to put food on the table. This time I didn't. Pretty warm. See that? - Look, it's still fresh. See how it's wet? - Yeah. - 'Cause it's close. - Yeah. So that means it's been here probably in the last 30 minutes. It's still warm. So, you know, I figure we just keep following this trail. We tracked the deer for quite a while. I was following Johnny pretty much all the way, 'cause he could see exactly what branches were broken, and he knows how to recognize deer trails and follow the feces, and he could even tell how long it's been since the droppings were there. Right between those two trees. Wait until he lines up. I give Irene an arrow, and, uh, Irene kinda moves up a little bit, gets in position, does her thing. Yeah! Nice! Shoots it right there, right in the sweet spot. I hit the deer in the neck, which I thought would take it out instantly. For some reason, the deer did not go in one hit, and Johnny and I had to follow it. I feel sick. What's wrong? I just... I'm so hungry. I feel sick if I don't eat. - After a while, you know? - Yeah. It's part of the game, you know? They're gonna try and make us suffer. - That's true. - You're good. I think we can win this. We just need to team up, you know, figure out a way to outsmart everyone. When I was fishing, I found a bracelet on a rock. We're in the middle of Siberia. Very weird. We saw some... some immediate blood spatters. Um, it was bleeding pretty bad, so we kept on the trail. Get inside! Everybody! Get inside right now! Everybody get inside right now! Get inside! Everybody! Get inside! Everybody get inside right now! There's a tiger! We saw a tiger! - What? - We saw a tiger in the woods! - There's a tiger! - Get in the cabin! - Right now, just get inside! - What? Come on! What are you talking about? Natalie, what... what's up? A real tiger! A (Bleep) tiger! What do you mean, a tiger? Like a real tiger? Yes, like a real tiger! Natalie, where? Was it... I don't know if it saw us or not. We thought it was following us for a while. It followed you? I don't know where we were. Come in, it's a tiger. How dangerous could he be? - Shut (Bleep) up, Miljan. - No, seriously, a big cat. You're, like, making a big drama here. It's not just a big cat! Tiger is a big cat. At least, technically. Are you serious? An 800-pound cat? Yeah, but... With razor-sharp teeth. Yeah, that's not dangerous at all. That's okay. You can stay down there and be eaten first. - That's fine with me. - Can I... Sam, what the (Bleep)? Get inside! There's a tiger! What are you talking about? Tiger where? Tiger where? - They saw a real tiger! - Who? Hey! Right there. Yeah! Nice shot! Thank you. He's young. I feel bad. It was really hard for me seeing it lying on the ground. And Johnny kept telling me, you know, we should get this back to camp, you know, quickly, "you should help me." Could it get in here, though? - It was huge. - It could get in anywhere. Are they, like, attracted to blood, or... - Of course they are. - Irene's out there. Irene's out there hunting with Johnny. There's gonna be blood everywhere. They can smell blood, like... like sharks? - They're predators, huh? - Of course. Be better if we could hang it so we can let it bleed faster. Are you serious? We're just gonna leave them out there? - Are you serious? - What are you going to do? I mean, Johnny's gonna take care of Irene. - This is all we... - They could also both get killed if nobody warns them that that thing is out there. They're hunting a deer. Johnny had told me right before they left, you know, "I'm gonna gut this thing wide open. There's gonna be blood everywhere." I'm sorry, but I'm not going out there. I'm not saying anybody has to go out there. I'll... I'll go out there. At that point, nobody wanted to go with him. Nobody knew what was out there. We saw the tiger, so we sure as (Bleep) weren't going back outside. I mean, I know I wasn't. And he didn't care. He still wanted to go by himself. He must have real feelings for Irene. Maybe it already ate. There's no guarantee it's gonna be hostile. Sounds like a suicide attempt, you walking out... a suicide attempt? That's a bit extreme. - Well... - For a smart kid, now you're not thinking smart. Sit down and just... let's talk about this. I'm not sitting down. Nobody else is gonna go... Is it worth your life? You're gonna go? Yeah. I'm gonna go. - You're going? - I'm going. Daniel. Please don't go! Daniel! I wasn't even nervous till I stepped into the woods, away from safety, away from camp. And as I got further in, then... started to regret it. You know, for two people, this is gonna feed us for a long time. I thought we were gonna take it back to camp. We are gonna take it back to camp, but I'm just saying... no one else is really doing anything for this, and, uh, I feel like, uh, since, you know, me and you are doing the work, it could be ours. I think we should take it back, because we can't finish that whole thing by ourself anyway. Yeah, we can. We can salt and cure the meat, and we can keep it for a long time. I mean, this is at least a 120-pound deer. I don't want to win that way. How do you want to win? You want to win and share the money with people? No, I think you should win fair and square, - but not just rob people... - Rob people? You're the one who shot it. Now I'm cutting it up. Yeah, but I'm saying that if somebody else had shot it, they'd probably share it with us. I don't they'd just... You don't know that. How do you know that? How could you say something like that? You have no idea. What the heck... (bleep), Daniel! Anne and Natalie said they saw a tiger. - A what? - We gotta get out of here. We gotta get back to camp. - Well, uh... - Now. Let's, um... how about we finish this up real quick? No. No. You don't get it. They smell blood. They're attracted to it. Hey! We shot this (Bleep) deer! We're not just gonna leave it out here. Why can't we just carry it? You give me five more minutes, I can spill at least 30 pounds out of this thing. - It'll be a lot lighter, okay? - Well, then go! Go! - I'm trying to do that... - Let's go! So quit (Bleep) talking to me. I wanted him to leave the deer there and just get out of there and... and get back to camp. If we get away from the deer, the tiger will go to the deer. He's... you know, there's blood. So you came all the way out here by yourself to look for us? Yeah, I mean... That's really brave. I honestly... I wasn't even thinking about that. I just didn't want you guys to get hurt. What do we know about siberian tigers? Well, they're on the endangered species list, so there's only a few hundred. Well, it doesn't make any sense. In all Siberia, there's only 300 tigers, and... and you come across one of them. How is a coincidence any less scary when the fact is that we saw one? You guys hear that? - I didn't hear anything. - I didn't hear anything. Exactly. I mean, there's something really big here, and all the other lone animals aren't doing anything? There's a predator around here. Just keep your eyes peeled. - (Bleep) What was that? - I don't know. We need... guys, we need to keep moving. Yeah. There is, uh... fire helps. You can carry fire. You can have more here. So if we stay around the fire, then at least, you know, we'll be a bit safer here than going out. Well, it's safe here, yeah. It's safer if we don't go out. It's safe around the fire, too. - Well, if it makes sense to stay here... - You girls... are you trying to scare us, or is this... is this... I'm not even answering that. That's a stupid question. I'm not gonna answer that. - It's not a stupid question. - Yes, it is a stupid question! Why would I be trying to scare you? You've managed to scare the (Bleep) out of us! I don't care! Why would I be trying to scare you? You think I have fun running in through the woods - being scared myself? - Whatever. Whatever. Just shut the (Bleep) up. Whatever. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You don't want to believe us, either, you can just... I don't know, go back to your daily life. Yeah, you can stay on the ground and get eaten. You're right by the door, Carolina. Natalie tries to act like she's this peace and love type of girl, but the reality is she's just playing this game like everybody else. It's, like, come on. Like, a tiger running loose in the forest? - If there was a tiger out there... - No, they might be... Surely it would be on a chain, there would be like a handler. - There was no (Bleep) chain. - Everything is... - everything is in contr... - We didn't see any handler. Everything is controlled. I couldn't believe it. It was like something a 7-year-old would tell me, like, "oh, I saw a tiger in the woods," you know? It was... ridiculous. If there's a tiger, it's in a safe environment. We're not... they're not gonna put us in an element where we're in danger. He actually suggested that there might be a leash attached to the tiger with someone hiding somewhere, because it's part of "the show," part of them trying to scare us. And I... I... was so pissed. I was like, "you don't think that we weren't looking around? "That we wouldn't notice someone standing out there, or we wouldn't notice a leash?" You... you... listen. - We heard the noises the other night... - Listen... around the campfire. We heard weird noises. Okay, let me tell you something. I went looking for firewood. Saw a tree. Next to the tree was a black wire connected to the tree. And leading up to the tree was a speaker, okay? That's probably what the noises were coming from. - What? When was that? - Why didn't you tell us that? 'Cause it's not a big deal. It's just... think about it. Anything that's creepy that's happening, it's all being put on us to make... - so we should be just chill? - To make us act like this. Look at us now. We've been in here for like 10 minutes debating about whether there's a tiger or not. And look. Logically, do you really think there's gonna be a tiger running loose just to pick us off like that? Come on. Everything's a game. It's a game. We're in a game. Okay, we... - guys, it's them. - It's them. - What? - What? They're here? They're back. We've got food! - Irene, did you shoot it? - Did you do it? Oh, my God! Yeah, it's really hard to believe that Irene had that... such skill and talent, too. 'Cause she's such a quiet character, you know? She doesn't really speak up much. You have to kind of force a conversation out of her sometimes, so we didn't know what to do. We had no food. So that was like a life-saver for us right there. Regarding Johnny, I think it's gonna turn out that it's a good thing that he's here. He doesn't have to win any personality contests. We don't have to be best friends. But I think he's an asset. Let's put it close to the fire, because if we sit, tiger's gonna be like... The tiger is real. I know that. So it's gotta know that we're here. I mean, why wouldn't you? And then we had that deer and that blood all over the place. I mean, I just think that right now we should lay low and just keep a fire burning and... and be smart about it. It was the first time in my life that I've eaten like a pig. I had grease everywhere. I enjoyed that deer like it was the last meal in someone's life. We couldn't completely enjoy it because we were literally (Bleep) ourselves about the fact that there's a tiger out there. We're in quite a bit of danger. And then I'm just thinking, oh, are we attracting them more by the smell of meat? It's a possibility that they... they were... that the girls are trying to scare us, but by the look in their eye, it was like... I could tell that it was of... they believed what they saw, you know, and... they maybe put the tiger out when the girls coming, and then as soon as they ran off, the tiger goes back into its cage, you know? It's nothing to be worried about. What's that bracelet, Sam? I... found it when I was going fishing. It says, "to my Anne. 1908." And it's in Russian. - Can you speak Russian? - A little. My grandmother spoke Russian. - Oh, cool. - Yeah. I think it was a gift from one lover to another. I'm gonna keep it as a good-luck charm. She's a regular Robin Hood. I couldn't have done it without Johnny tracking the animal, - so it was teamwork. - Teamwork. Maybe we should hurry up. What? Oh, yeah, or maybe it's a big-ass tiger. Don't talk. I'll go with you. All of a sudden, there was this rustling and growling in the... in the woods. It's dark. We don't know exactly where it's coming from, but it was out there, it sounded pretty close, and it sounded pretty big. I heard it circling. I don't know the first thing about tigers. - I mean, they... - They didn't even believe us. I know! I asked Dan. He said he did, but... Well, why are they all still out there? No one else is scared? I don't get it. I kind of realized that maybe what Neeko was saying was true. Maybe it was a plant by the show. Maybe it was just a way of trying to make us scared. So I'm feeling a bit less scared about that tiger, and I just wish Neeko would have told us before that there was the speakers. I wish he wouldn't have saved that information to himself. I just came to the conclusion it... it's part of the... the show, you know? Put a speaker out in the woods, make some noises, scare us a little bit, get some reactions. You know, it... it makes great TV. Somewhere around here. Carolina came directly to me and she whispered in my ear, saying, "I've got some... I think I have something to show you," or, "something's going on out there." I couldn't make out what she was saying, anyway. We went off into the woods. She was just saying... explaining to me she saw Johnny, um, from a distance, acting suspiciously, you know, snooping around. You're kidding me. Oh, my God. Son of a bitch. - You didn't feel sick? - From what? The deer. I was so ill. No. I felt good after the deer. I was like, he's poisoned me! I felt good at the time, but I don't know... I might have poisoned you. Get rid of the competition. Oh, that's good. You think I'm a threat then. I kind of like that. - You might be lucky. - Good morning, guys. Breakfast's ready. - Anyone recognize this? - Where'd you get my shirt? Huh? Great plan, dude. - Great plan. - What do you mean, "great plan"? That's your shirt. Steal the food, set the shed on fire? I didn't do that. You take the food and then you burn it - so nobody knows it was you! - Oh, you saw me do that? No one saw me do that, did they? But you were the first one there. Yeah, that doesn't mean I set the shed on fire. Why would I do that? That was my food, too. - It's your master plan. - Cover your tracks. - Cover your tracks. - Okay, so just tell me, what were you doing the other day over there? - Like a hero. - Just tell me, what were you doing over there? I was... I wasn't doing anything with that. I was... - Doing what? - Doing what? Keep going. Keep talking, Johnny. Go home! Nobody needs you here. Hey, hey, hey. The button's this way. - Exactly. - The button's this way. So why don't you go push it, fat-ass? He needs to go. Everybody's up to here. You know? Especially me, 'cause I don't like to be fooled. A zebra doesn't change its stripes. Steal the food, set the shed on fire. Food's gone. People start to leave. And you guys are all surprised? He looked like that from the first day. I know you kind of liked him a little bit, huh? No, I just feel bad. Why do you feel bad? I just feel bad. 'Cause you had to come and bust him? Yeah. Yeah, but that was so important, you had to. How could you not, you know? Don't feel bad. We just had to tell everybody that Johnny took the food, and it makes me feel really bad. I think Johnny's gonna have a rough time at camp with everyone now. I think he's just done himself the biggest disservice, 'cause he didn't get away with it. If he had have got away with it... genius. But... he didn't, so... yeah. I think he needs to be careful and watch his back. 100% I think this is strategy for him. He's a smart guy. He's... he's very sly. From the beginning, I've always felt and known there was something about him that wasn't quite right. And slowly he's... he's forgetting to cover his tracks, just like today. And that's how he got found out. And right now I'm just, uh, hiding the food from, uh, pretty much everyone in the camp. Uh, I don't trust anyone at this stage. It's, uh... you know, you think you can trust people, and you can't. With things as valuable as this to us, I don't feel... I don't feel comfortable just leaving it out. Johnny took off, went into the woods. He's all by himself. Um... at this point, I really don't care. Like, I'm kind of happy, actually. I'm really... I am happy that he's out there by himself, away from us. He just makes life difficult. Even to communicate, it's hard just to get a-a simple answer out of this guy. So he's out there in the woods. I don't give a damn. The longer he stays out there, jubilation for me. And Carolina said she saw him doing something anyway. He didn't stand his ground. He just bitched out like a little girl. - He just walked away. - 'Cause he's guilty. - Yeah. - Like... Sabina. What are you doing? Wondering. What? Wondering what would do that to a tiger. What the hell? - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
