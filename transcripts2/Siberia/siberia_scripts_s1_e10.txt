 Previously on Siberia... Oh, my God. We got four dead bodies, all of whom are shot. - Hello? - We're not getting a signal. - We're so close. - Guys, I know what the problem is. I know what the problem is. Hey, I know what the problem is. Oh, my God. That's the beacon. No wonder we couldn't find this place. - Miljan, where have you been? - They took her. They're coming for us, guys. They're gonna get us. - Did you see Esther around? - No.

 - What happened to Irene? - They took her. We have to find the gun. Run! Look for a gun! Look for a gun! It's a plane! Hey! What is that? It's footage from a 1927 expedition. That's-- See that guy right there? That's Leonid Kulik. Kulik? Isn't that the guy from Miljan's journal? - Guys, come on out! - What, again, Miljan? What? Hey! _

 _ _ - Sabina. - Shh! _ No. _ Let's just get the hell out of here. Can we use this to get online and try and get some help here? There's no internet out here. So can't you hack it or something? You-- No, you can't just hack it. If there's no internet, there's no internet. - It's a research station. - All right. They don't-- they don't have internet. All right? So let's forget about the internet. What do we do? We gotta do something. I don't think we go back out there again. I'm not going through the same thing. 'Cause the next time we go out there, we're dead. If we don't help the others, they're dead. Daniel, I hate to break it to you, man, but listen, if they haven't been found by a rescue group, Irene's gone. Fuck you, dude. Well, that's gonna do a lot of good. I'm just trying to be realistic here. I mean, three days in this shithole? You were just telling him the truth. Hey. I brought you some boots. I failed. Come on, Daniel. You didn't fail. Everything we've done, we've done because you've pushed us because you want to help Irene. This was a stupid plan. Come out to this? To what? This is nothing. We're not any closer to being rescued than we were before. You know what? You got us here. We have shelter, we... These things we've seen and been through-- just nothing makes sense anymore. It's like Victoria. She just-- she said we all should have left. Why didn't we listen? I know you're questioning yourself, but I know you're strong, and-- and if it wasn't for you, we-- we would have not made it, okay? I just don't feel like that's true. I need you to man up. I can't have you broken down, because I'm counting on you, Daniel. We all have to be strong, and we're all in this together. And I need you to fix that radio. I want to get out of here, too. I want to go home. I'm gonna go check out the beacon. Thanks for the boots. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, relax. Relax. Esther, Annie, are you all right? Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com - Shh. - Guys, did you see--? _ - Shh. - Did you see that blood? - Shh! - They didn't hurt you? - They didn't touch you? - No, no. What about Irene? Have you seen Irene? - She's in another tent. She... - Is she okay? _ _ Well, if she's there, she's not dead, right? She hasn't come out. Why would they take a corpse inside? I think we can fix this. Sam, this isn't like one of your cars. What I'm trying to say is... with your brains and my hands, we can get it done. I don't know, Sam. What you got? You ever heard of a loop antenna? No. What's that? Uh, you know how a car has an antenna by the windshield and then there's another that kind of coils around? - Goes around the windshield. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. If we can loop it around the roof, we can make our own antenna. You know how to do it? No. But I'll figure it out. What do you need from me? As much wire as possible. Let's rock 'n' roll. Whatcha doin'? I'm just checking to see if these guys have any cell phones or anything. Lootin', huh? Wouldn't call it that. Does this creep you out at all? What do you mean? I don't know. I mean... Don't take a genius to figure out something weird is going on here, you know? Something... The charts, the graphs... those dead bodies. Maybe those guys found out something they weren't supposed to know. So what do they expect us to do? Just sit here and wait? We have to wait. We can't piss them off. We have to see what they want. Okay? Just calm down, Neeko. But Sam read about these... in that book. You mean the Evenkis? Yeah. Like, the natives. Well, if it's them, they should be able to help us. Do they look like they want to help us? They're outside with weapons. Well, I'm not gonna just sit here - and wait for something bad to happen to us. - You have to wait. You have to wait. You have to be quiet. - I'm not gonna just sit here... - Shh! ...and wait for them to come in and waste us all. No, I'm gonna do something about it. There must be something. Neeko. Neeko! - Neeko, what are you doing? - No! No. No. - Who's in charge here? Huh? - I'm sorry. So sorry. We're done. - We're going back. - Why did you take us?! - Anyone speak English?! Huh? - Hey! - Who's in charge? - It's okay-- - What's wrong with you? - Shh! Stop! Who are you? You speak English? Little. Yes. Why did you take us? What's the meaning to all of this? Huh? You are trespassers here. We don't mean to trespass, okay? We are part of a TV show. Something went wrong. We've been looking for help. We're not from here. I'm from London. She's from Israel. Montenegro. Australia. Louisiana, okay? Please. We just want to get home. Do you have a phone? Do you have a radio? Anything for us to just get help? We just want to leave. We come in peace. We cannot help you. We tried to warn you to leave, but you did not go. Now you have caused much trouble for us all. The Shaman will decide what we must do with you. We're going inside. Let's go inside. Shaman. Let's go inside. We're going. What does she mean, "Shaman"? - What is she talking about? - It's like a leader. It's like a leader. So it has to be a guy higher than her, then? - That we can speak to. - Shh! Try do it again-- - Sabina, we have to do something. - I'll put you down. Don't you dare. You can't do that shit. Let's go see it. Go ahead. I'm gonna keep checking the lockers. Come with me. Is that the bird that Sam saw? Come on. Okay. I'll be there in a second. - Come. - I'm coming! Oh, wow. It's heavy. It's like a meteorite. What are we doing in here? Oh, my God. Johnny, look at this one. Can we just get out of here, please? I think that's the bird Sam said he saw. You gotta help me free it. What? He's gonna die in there if we just leave it there. I don't want anything to do with the bird. - That's all I'm saying. - What is your problem with the bird? - I don't have a problem with-- - Help me let it go, and then-- and then we can get out of here. Joyce. You've gotta be kidding. Is that a Revealer? Listen... I think we should run really fast now. They're distracted. - What are you talking about? - They're all talking. We can run fast. Run where? Where would we go? They'd just find us again. - Come on-- - I can run fast enough. - We can't leave Irene. - Irene is already dead probably. - You don't know that. Where are you gonna go? They know where the settlement is. _ - Shh. Shut up. - Ridiculous. Yes. Thank you. Who was that girl? I met her before. - What? - I met her before. - Where? - In the forest. - Why didn't you tell us? - You just know her? I guess we all have our own little secrets, don't we? Are you serious? Well, she seems to like you. Maybe you can get her to help us. I think she already is helping. How much wire you need? Uh, CB communication is usually an arrangement of 25 megahertz, so about one wavelength is all we're gonna need. Feet. How many feet? Feet, feet. 40. 40 feet. You got it. No way. Sam! Yeah? Why the hell is this here? Sam, do you know what it says here? What does it say? "Primate." Uh, "Primate Studies..." "Primate Studies Test Group A." Test Group A? Didn't it say Test Group C at the settlement? - It did. - So what? They're studying us? They must be. These are Skinner boxes. What's a Skinner box? They use them in behavioral stimuli experiments. Like, it's a risk-reward thing. Like, if an animal does something good, it gets rewarded... - We're not fucking animals. - ...but if it does something bad, - it gets shocked. - Why are they studying us? I don't know why they're doing that. They could be, though. Why would they leave us here? Wait a sec. Those-- those scientists in there? Were they studying us? Those dead guys? Listen, listen, we got more important things to worry-- Why were they killed? - We have more important things to talk-- - What's more important than that? - Those people are-- - Daniel came up with an idea. - I got an idea to get out of here. - ...that we can make a loop antenna. - Right? A loop antenna. - Yeah. Then we can get the radio to go. We get wire. We hook it up. We can get a signal out. We're arguing about a bunch of bullshit. - What's the idea? What do we do? - Why don't we go? Let's go. Because you're the one who's talking. - Let's just get the wire. - Take it easy. Take it easy. - I'm just trying to figure out what I need to do. - We're arguing about stupid stuff. - Get wire. - Hey. I got it, dad. Help me free the bird, and then we get wire. Joyce, enough with the bird. Is this the Shaman coming? What is he doing? Those mushrooms are poisonous. The mushrooms, they allow him to see-- to see what will happen. And then he will know what to decide. So when you eat mushrooms, you can see the future? Yes. Our friend ate these once, and she was, like, hallucinating. She almost died. He is a holy man. He can eat them. Others cannot. But I... Is he okay? Yes. What the hell? Is that normal? - Is that good or no? - I cannot say. Oh, my God, he didn't look happy at all. Is he getting a message from the spirits? Whatever it was, it wasn't good. Did you see his eyes? Hey. What's going on? Do you know what's going on? _ - They're gonna hurt us? - Do they want to hurt us? - I like you guys. - No. No, no. Of course they won't hurt us. No. What's your name? Sasha. Sasha. That's a beautiful name. Who are these people? That woman-- is she your mother? Can you tell us... Shh! _ _ - Can you under-- - Can you tell us-- - Shh. Just keep quiet. - Don't scare her. Don't scare her. _ I can't wait to put my hands on those friends of yours. What friends? Those producer friends. Producers? They're not my friends. Just hired me for a job. I forgot. Everything's just a job to you. What do you mean? Nothin'. Just say it. What do-- what do you mean? I just... I saw those instructions - at the base camp, okay? - What instructions? Instructions that said, "Romance Johnny" "Pretend you're interested." "Start a relationship with him." - God, Johnny, does that really matter right now? - Make me look like a fool. Yeah, it does matter. Shh. Come now. Come what? Come! Why can't she tell us in here? - We have to go. - Come now. What is it? He says that you are to leave here. We will take you over the ridge. There are white men there. They can help you. But... you must leave this place. You are banished from here. You must never return. Don't worry about that. We won't. Thank you so much. Can we see our friend? Please? Sasha. Show them. Thank you. Is she okay? Irene. Irene? Hey. Oh, my God. Hey. You guys are here. Neeko and Sabina. How are you? I feel so much better. You've got all the color back in your face. Your fever is gone. It's gone. How's your leg? It's a lot better. - Can I see it? - Yeah. - Oh, wow. - Oh, God. How is that possible? They kept putting this stuff on it. Healing herbs. - What? - Your people? My people put them on her leg to make it better. They helped her. Yeah. Where's, uh... Where are the others? We haven't seen them. But, um, I'm sure they're fine. But the Evenki, they said they're gonna take us to safety. They said they know where some people are. What? Mm-hmm. So that... that means... we're gonna go home? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Oh, my gosh. Do you wanna sit up? Yeah. Thank you, Neeko. Irene, there's something we should tell you. We need to tell her. You remember when... Natalie left us? She didn't make it. We found her body out in the snow. What? Yeah. We don't know what happened, but Annie and I-- we had a ceremony for her and we said good-bye. We don't know what happened. Aah! Look. Look. Sasha! - What do you see? - What's out there? - Oh, my God. Do you see that? - What? - There's blood everywhere. - What? Who? One of the Evenkis. He got hurt right here. We heard this horrible scream last night. With what? I didn't hear a gunshot, I didn't hear... I mean, what's attacking him? Whatever it was, it was close. You sure I got enough wire? You said you needed it for the whole roof. No. We don't need that much. I was wrong about that. It's actually good-- we don't need hardly as much. Well, be careful. I will. Is it okay there? Yeah. Think she'll be okay, Sam? - Irene? - Yeah. I'm telling you, Irene's gonna be fine. She's in good hands. You need to stop worrying about her and you need to focus on that. I promise you she's gonna be okay. Okay? - Okay. - She's gonna be fine. I never lied to you about anything, okay? - Really? - Yeah. I was honest about everything! - You even lied about your name! - You were flirting-- What are you talking about? - You were flirting with everyone in the camp. - What-- Like who? - Like Esther. - Esther? - Yeah. And you're a rodeo rider from North Carolina? - Esther? - Yes, I am. - Really? What type of bulls do you ride? - All kinds. - All kinds? You know what? That's the biggest bullshit. They do background checks on everyone. You don't ride any bulls. And what do you want the money for, huh? You seemed pretty adamant about getting the money. It's none of your business, okay? You're right. Miljan, do you see anything? Nothing. Esther. I found this on your bed when Irene disappeared. You wanna explain it? I don't know what you're talking about. - Okay. - Guys. Guys. What happened to that man out there? He was attacked. By who? Our word is Mangini. They are the ones of the valley. The Valley Men. Is it another tribe? They are our enemies. Many bad things have happened since the ancient truce was violated... by you. By us? You crossed into their territory. And now they blame us. Rest now. We leave at first light. It is too dangerous to go now. Uh, we need to go back to our camp first. For what? There's nothing there. Yes, there is. We-- we have to go back and... get all our supplies. I mean, what if we got stuck out there? We will go to your camp. It is on the way to where we will take you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you so much. Johnny, please. I just wanna be alone, okay? Just... - Joyce. Joyce, Joyce... - I just wanna be alone, okay? I just wanna be alone. It's okay. Just breathe. Just breathe. How'd you get so smart? You're, like, some kind of a genius. Little Rain Man. Little MacGyver. Sam, I just... I don't know. I read a lot. I once read a book. How was that for you, Sam? You didn't hurt yourself, did you? Had a lot of pictures in it. You like looking at girlie magazines? - Girlie magazine? - Yeah. Like what? Daniel! - You okay? Huh? - Ugh. - Are you okay? - Yeah. You sure? Guys! Guys, guys. Daniel's been hurt. He's... Hurry. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Be careful. - Daniel, sit down for a little while. Relax. - Let me see. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I think so. Guys, we're so close to being done, okay? I mean, literally, all we have to do is just one more step, and we can send that signal. Let's just get it done. You cool with that? - Yeah. - Okay. When I first met Daniel, I was like, "You should be in school. So what are you doing here?" Wow. He's amazing. He's the... the David. You know? David and Goliath? He's got more balls than I've ever had. He's a skinny little kid, but he's smart, and he's got courage. So that woman is not your mother, right? Who is she? She looks after me. What about your mom? I don't remember much about my mother, but... I do remember my father. Do you know where your parents are from? Well, my father was an American scientist. He taught Merilik and her husband how to speak English. He used to live with the people here. But... What? He's gone. I'm sorry. Merilik has taken care of me ever since. I have a son your age. I'll show you. Look. I keep his picture in a locket. You see? He's... he's cute. Where is he now? He's back home. I have to go back for him. Maybe one day, when I'm out of this and I go back home, maybe you can meet him. I think you'll like him. This tribe... It's not a tribe, man. It's the Valley Men. They're not a tribe. - Oh, my God. - Whatever it is, it's got these guys really spooked. Yeah. You think they could have done that to Natalie? Maybe. I don't know. But all I know is that we can't trust these guys. Can we trust Sabina? I trust Sabina more than I trust these guys. Even after you know that she knew who that little girl is? All I'm saying is that we need to be careful, 'cause we're not exactly safe yet. We don't have any other choice. We have to trust them for now, at least. - Right. What else are we gonna do? - We need to leave this place. That's for sure. They don't want us here. They want us out. Sasha! Come. It is cold. Hey. Hey, hey. Right there. Whatever you just did. Thank you. - Delicious. - Thank you. May I ask what your name is? My name is Merilik. My name's Neeko. Is your friend okay? I do not know. The Shaman is with him now. His suffering is for all of us, for our sins. I don't understand. What do you mean, "sins"? The punishment-- it's come again. One hundred years ago Ogdy punished our people for their sins by flattening the land and lighting the sky on fire. That's what we saw. We saw that in the sky a few nights ago. Many have stopped believing in the old ways. Now it is happening again. What is this Ogdy? Ogdy-- he is our God. Thank you, thank you. Okay. Look. Camera guy helped me out with a list. - This is written out phonetically. - Mm-hmm. Take your time. Nice and slow. Go through the list. It doesn't matter, any particular order. - Okay. - Make sure you key the mic when you speak. - Mm-hmm. - And then let go, wait for a response. I got it, Sam. It's not that difficult. All right. So just... slow. You got it. I lost my wife. Don't have much family. But, uh, the kids at the school-- 'cause, you know, I was a former cage fighter, and then I started working with kids. I can't wait to see 'em again. Now that we got a working radio, I hope that I will. I was really lucky because I had... these guys that really helped me get here, because honestly I didn't think I was gonna make it. And Johnny... Johnny's even sweeter than I thought. There was a moment where I just wanted to give up. But at least we're lucky enough. We have food. We have shelter. So right now I'm just hoping and praying that we're gonna go home soon. - Are you ready? - Yes. Guys, let's go. Sasha. Come. We should at least thank her. Thank you. Go! Daniel. You been here all night? Yeah. Didn't sleep at all? Come on. Go-- go rest. I'll take over. No. No, I want to stay. No, I'll take over for a little bit. Go rest. I don't wanna miss it. I don't wanna miss it. Did you get anything? No. I haven't heard a thing. You want some more coffee? Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks. It's just so weird to be here. I know. It's eerie. Guys, bring anything you find that's gonna be useful, okay? I feel a lot better. Thank you so much. Annie. Sasha. Not too far. Esther, you need a hand with that? No, I'm fine. This thing's not heavy. - Guys, did we get all the food? - Yeah. Your food, you mean? Your stash? I got it. I'll help you out with that. I knew we were gonna be good friends, huh? I told you. I don't ever want to see this place again. It's strange. For me, it feels like I'm leaving my home. Well, that's it. We're leaving the game. Just us six. But no one wins any money. I don't consider myself a hero. I just wanna get home. I want to get these people home with me, but... You know, I got-- I got people at home that I care about that I... that I need to get back to. You know, it sounds selfish, but I... I'm not gonna make an idiot decision, you know, where it's gonna risk my life or... or the people that I care about. That just, you know... doesn't make sense, you know? I'm not a superhero. Oh, my God. Guys! What's going on? - What do they know, guys? - Why have the dogs stopped? Why'd the dogs stop? What's that? Guys, just be careful. Get away from that, quickly! We must go! - What is that? - Why? This place is cursed. We cannot go this way. Sasha! On the sled! Why's she freaking out? Well, she said it's cursed. Can I please ask you a question? What was that weird thing, the round thing in the woods that we saw before? There are some places in the woods that have strange effects on the mind. You forget where you have gone and become lost. Many people have died in the woods this way. That is why they call this the Valley of Death. Not even the animals dare to live here. - You got somebody? - What happened? - Change. Change. Change. Change. - He said he had a signal? - He actually talked to somebody? - He had a signal. He had a signal. - He talked to somebody? - Shh. Shh. Shh. Change-- change the channel. Oh, my God, there's somebody there! The location. He needs to know where we are. Go get it. We need the location. Why do we stop? Why are we stopped again? This is as far as we can take you. - Why? - What? Why? There are some places the Evenki do not go. Beyond this line is the territory of the Valley Men. You must go alone. Through the trees, straight on through to the mountain peak. You will find your people. If you leave now, you will arrive by nightfall. I know this sign. What does it mean? It is the symbol of the Valley Men. It marks the line between our territories. You violated the law when you camped at the edge of their territory. That is why we tried to scare you away. I'm sorry, but we cannot take you any further. You said you would take us to our people. If you follow the path, you will find them there. Irene, you okay to walk? I have to. You sure? You don't need any help? Please. Can we take some-- We need something. We have one rifle. - We're not gonna make it by ourselves. - We don't have anything. Can we take some weapon? Can we take this-- some spear with us or something? Can we take? Can we take this with us? Please? Forget about it. Just come on. I am sorry I cannot help you. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be alive right now. So, um... thanks. Be safe. Sasha. Oh. Just a second, please. Please. Just... Take care of yourself, okay? You promise me? _ _ Sasha. Come. Are you guys trying to scare us again? What do you mean? The monster feet. No. Those are the foot of the Valley Men. We wear them to make their tracks so they do not follow us. Let's go. - Hurry. - Okay. Let's go. Let me see where we are, Johnny. - Yeah, Johnny. Yeah-- - This is it! Daniel, Daniel, do it! Can you tell them to stay there, please? Sam, tell him. Sam, tell him. Right here? Yeah. No, that's not right. - It's gotta be exact. - In Russian. In Russian. Come on, Daniel. Write this down. Hurry up. - Okay. That's it. - That's it? Okay. Right there. What's that mean? Why aren't they talking back? Sam, why aren't they talking back? Give him a chance to respond! Why aren't they talking back? Give me a chance. - Give him a second. - He lost the signal. More. More. Come on. A little more. - Please. Please. - Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa... Hey! They're coming! They're coming! They're coming!
