 {\an8}Kiss! {\an8}-Can you please knock it off? - Kiss! {\an8}Kiss! {\an8}Take it. It's embarrassing. Thanks. Ru-mi is crying. She must have been touched, right? She's crying a lot. She's crying way too much. Why are you crying? She must be happy.

 Isn't the meat done? Why aren't you giving me any? Oh, that's right. The meat will burn. - Please sit and wait a minute. - Please sit down. A little later. Aren't you close to her? She said she wants to know me three times. What does that mean? It's not what you think. We're not passionately... What are you doing here? I took a shower and my clothes were wet. She doesn't like you anymore. She likes me. Stop crying. I don't think Gun-woo has a clue.

 Can you get Gun-woo for me? Tell me what's going on first. Gun-woo is probably feeling out of it. No, I'm fine. You should leave, too. Sorry. I should've been more observant. It must have been tough for you. Just get mad. I'm more embarrassed than angry. Didn't I look like a fool earlier? It's not that I don't like you. I just started having feelings for him. He hates me. He's not an easy person. You know? Pretty much. It's a crush. Maestro Kang... You don't need to be sorry. It's not like we went out for years, or were engaged. We have nothing. What can I do? What can I do to make you feel better? Let's just be friends... Friends? Sorry, but that's too hard for me. An army buddy of mine wants to see me. I'll be late. Don't wait up. Assemblyman Choi knows about it. There's going to be an election in three months. He'll criticize me for being involved in the 300-million-won Seokran Philharmonic fraud. What are his party's plans? Oh, yes. They're going to report you and Ru-mi for forging official documents. Mayor Kang told me to write up documents to cover the 300 million won that was scammed-- Hey, when... When did I say that? Ru-mi did that all by herself. Yes, Ru-mi did it alone. Are you saying you didn't know about it? Didn't you storm into our rehearsal-- Of course, I was aware of it. That's why I'm planning on reporting Ru-mi first. I'm uncomfortable about reporting my employee, but I can't lose. I made a bet. Did you make an outline of the announcement? - Yes. - Give it to me. Here. - Here you go. - Here it is. "To the great citizens of Seokran. There will be no corruption while I'm the mayor of Seokran. It pains me, but I have to fire an employee personally and report them to the prosecutor. With this incident, the city of Seokran will become more upright with integrity." What do you think? Is there anything I should fix? Did you find a person who will make a supporting speech? Will you do it for me? What that person just said is a complete lie! He knew ahead of time. He's the one who instructed someone to forge the documents! Let's shoot a drama filled with twists. Sir, this isn't a bet for petty cash. It's politics. You should keep it that way. Why are you involving my orchestra members-- Because the orchestra members are the problem. An old man who has dementia, a cabaret worker, and a high school girl. Do you think you're off the hook? Aren't you the one who accepted those people as-- Fire me instead. I can't do that. Don't you know you're essential to sustaining the city orchestra? Don't you dare do anything to Ru-mi or any of my orchestra members. The moment you do, I'll expose you. Mr. Kang, I need to live. Music is your everything, right? Politics is like that for me. I'll die if I'm ousted from this position. It's a life-and-death situation for me. What wouldn't I do? You need to brace yourself. Get in. Don't you have a doctor's appointment today? Aren't you removing your bandages a bit too early? Shouldn't you keep them on for at least two weeks? Have you talked to Ru-mi? I have. - It's you. - What do you mean? The person Ru-mi likes. It's nothing. It's like when a high school student has a crush on a teacher. You knew about it. What about you? She's only an orchestra member. Be honest. I don't want to be an idiot anymore. What do you want? If I tell you, will you make it happen? Yes. I don't like either. I don't like you liking Ru-mi. And I don't like you not liking Ru-mi. That's how I feel. I don't want to see Ru-mi hurting. The swelling went down a lot, and the fracture is healing well. It doesn't hurt, does it? Yes, it hurts. I'm not interested in you, Ru-mi. Love? Emotions? It's all a hormonal prank. It can be controlled by trying. I think you're an untalented and deaf orchestra member who's a troublemaker. Besides, it's Gun-woo. Are you trying to make me a scumbag who steals his pupil's girlfriend? Focus on the basics. Don't stick your nose in everywhere. You look like an airhead. I feel nasty to know a person like you is in my orchestra. Get out. Submit your letter of resignation by Monday. Oh, that feels good. Yes? Have you thought about it? What is there to think about? I can't agree to Mayor Kang's-- Now is not the time to be stubborn. Things aren't going well right now. Hello? Have you talked to Ru-mi? I'm about to right now. - Where are you going? - I'm going to reflect. I got distracted by a very mean person. Not only is he mean, but he's also cruel, selfish, and a lot older than me. He's 15 years older. He's totally an old man. I must have been crazy. That's why I'm going to snap out of it by running. And I'm going to dunk my head in the East Sea. What about your hearing? Weren't you in an accident last time? I may die. If that happens, I'll get what I deserve. For hurting Gun-woo. For your safety, take a tricycle... Check out Sunny Hill. You'll cleanse your body and soul while looking at the sunrise. I will. And... I'm going to call you every day. Why would you call me if you're going to reflect? But don't answer my calls. No matter how big a mistake I make, I don't deserve to be called nasty and shameless. That's why I plan on pestering you. I'm going to annoy you by calling you. You'll tolerate it even if it's noisy. Don't ever pick up. If you do... Don't worry, I won't. Will you resign when you get back? I'm not coming back. I already sent my resignation. I'm going to my mother's house in Daejeon after the trip. I'm going to have the movers get my stuff. This is the last time... I'll be seeing you. Goodbye. Thoven. Ru-mi is leaving. You should tell her to take care. MAYOR KANG CHUN-BAE Has Mr. Kang called? No. Didn't he refuse to attend the luncheon with the president? He said it's a hassle. He has always been invited as an honorary guest, but he has never gone-- Is that something to be proud of? He needs to go and tell the president that Seokran is doing well, that Mayor Kang Chun-bae is a remarkable man, and to designate Seokran as a cultural zone. Wouldn't that be nice? We should be living harmoniously. He doesn't know the basics. Darn it. Well... What's your opinion? Do you think Maestro Kang will take our side? - I believe it will be difficult. - Oh, man... He has a very good relationship with his members after the performance. - They're like peas and carrots. - Peas and carrots? Peas and carrots. That's right. He can't conduct without his members. Who is Maestro Kang's right-hand man? - Sorry? - Who is his confidant? Pardon? You need to leave the city orchestra. Submit your resignation. But... Why? Didn't you miss three days because you didn't fully quit your previous job? And you were late once, and you didn't come to a few practices-- Mr. Kim! You shouldn't yell here. If you have any objections, go argue with Mr. Kang. Gosh, Maestro Kang is so uncooperative. Sir, what's going on? I just got fired. Didn't you agree... No, I mean... They said it's the same as if you had agreed to it. What do they mean by that? Yes. Where's the mayor? The mayor is on the line. Mr. Kang Gun-woo is here. I'll hand him the phone. What are you doing? Didn't I tell you I needed to live? I know Mr. Park Hyeok-gwon didn't do anything wrong. But what can I do? I need to be strong in order to compete with a powerful person like you. Where's Maestro Kang? Did he come here? Hyeok-gwon... Okay. I'm going to report Ru-mi and fire all the unqualified orchestra members. All you have to do is keep your mouth closed. If you resist, who else should I fire next? Jung Hui-yeon? Oh, Kim Gap-yong? Kang Gun-woo? What did he say? It was a mistake, right? I was too optimistic about the situation. What do you mean? Can I be reinstated? Where are you going? We need to... - Hey! - Hyeok-gwon. Let go. Let go of me! Hyeok-gwon! I'm the breadwinner! I need to earn money! Hey, stop right there! - Calm down for a minute. - Where are you running away to? Is this the price I pay after doing everything for you? - Hyeok-gwon! - Maestro Kang! He's going to report Ru-mi? I already fired Ru-mi. I was able to buy some time. He can still report her even though I fired her. Does Ru-mi know? If she did, would she have gone on a trip? She left without any hesitation. It's a good thing. The sentence for forging official documents is up to three years. She'll go deaf while in prison. She'll be in prison for three years, betrayed by people she trusted... What should we do? I don't know. I really don't. How would you know what to do? FEISTY CHICKEN Did you not sleep? We need to use a harsher method. You handle the people. You can do it, right? What are you going to do? Don't tell them what I told you yesterday. It's just discouraging. - Is it this room? - Yes. The conductor must not be here yet. - Are you going to stand there? - No. Oh, okay. Let's see... You're a lot more handsome in person. There's no need for the lip service. I heard you're going to report my members. Sorry? What are you talking about? Did you know someone else was going to beat you to it? - Sorry? - I'll introduce you to him. It's Mayor Kang Chun-bae. OCTOBER 5 TO-DO LIST Do you think that will shoo your dementia away? Maybe writing in this will work. I designed each page. Isn't it cute? I'm not a kid. How can I carry this around? MY NAME IS KIM GAP-YOUNG AND I HAVE DEMENTIA Who's Yeong-ju? How do you know that name? You called me Yeong-ju. Who is that? There's no practice today. I'll tell you the evaluation results instead. Evaluation? We never auditioned to be evaluated. Did you double-book us? Yes, because I'm a busy man. I have to attend the luncheon with the president later and... There are only two hours left. I was notified you won't be attending. I changed my mind. I have something to say. Assemblyman Choi, were you the director of Myeongseong Art High School? Yes, until last year. You used 4.2 billion won of the school's funds. Who in the world... Du Ru-mi was scammed, but you, Assemblyman Choi, embezzled money. It's 300 million against 4.2 billion. The amounts cannot be compared. Should I go head-on with you? I know nothing about this. Aren't you being reviewed for your candidacy these days? Yes. If you're lucky, you'll only get dropped from the mayoral race. I said I know nothing about this! That's exactly what I'm talking about. Say that about Ru-mi's incident, too. Then I won't say anything to the president. Let's do that. Isn't it bad to run negative campaigns, criticize the opponent, and reveal things? Why don't we play fair-- What about the orchestra members? You know the ones who are unqualified to be orchestra members? Do you think people won't find out just because I keep my mouth closed? I took care of that. These results are based on the last concert. Cellist Nam Yeong-Eun has been promoted to first cello. - Wow. - Wow. We're going to hold auditions to get more members and first musicians. Will you be hiring backup performers again? No, we eliminated that policy. What? Violinists Du Ru-mi, Kim Ju-yeon, and Kim Ju-hui. Cellist Jung Hui-yeon. Contrabassist Park Hyeok-gwon and Park Jung-gwon. Oboist Kim Gap-yong. Flutist I-deun Ha and Kang Ju-mi. Clarinetist Hong Jun-gi. Trombonist Nam U-gil. Trumpet players Kang Gun-woo and Bae Yong-gi. Thanks for everything you've done. I hope we can meet again some other time. - What's going on? - What do you mean, "some other time"? Did we just get fired? Is he telling us to leave or something? Mr. Kim. Where is Mr. Kang? Oh, yes. I forgot to tell you. The city of Seokran is going to host an orchestra festival in two months. Gather people together and enter that. Maestro said he'd find a way somehow if your evaluation results are good there. Many good orchestras will be there. Do you think it's possible? You handle the people. You can do it, right? - The orchestra festival? - Yes. If they participate, critics will comment on each performance. It will be a topic of conversation if the word gets out. It will be a huge opportunity for a no-name orchestra. So if the orchestra members receive a good evaluation... Please accept them as official orchestra members. Once they're fired, they're fired. What's with all the hassle? Mr. Kang. Where are you going all of a sudden? I'm going to the presidential luncheon. I'll have to tell the president that you doctored the budget. Mr. Kang, I'm really sorry for what I did last time. Can we please think about this for a moment? Please sit... By the way, the qualification issue is like a stigma in Korea. It's like a scarlet letter. A regular method won't work. That's why I want them to be evaluated objectively. Then no one can complain. Well... If we take them back as orchestra members, we would be admitting that we wrongfully fired them. It will be a huge blow to our orchestra and to your image. I know, but I don't care. If we accept them, we'll have too many people. We might exceed our budget-- Reduce my salary if that happens. There are no reasons for me to oppose, but... Why are you trying so hard to bring them on board? They are my orchestra members. Conductors meet many musicians, but it isn't easy to find members they can call their own. Some conductors never do. It's been 15 years since I became a conductor, and I've finally found them. I can't give up on them that easily. Is that right? Oh, my... Hyeok-gwon was fired, too. Give me that. Give it to me. I can't trust you because you're a weasel. Were you really fired? Hello? Did you hang up? Don't hang up. Pick up the phone! Hello? Hello? That rude bastard. Oh, man. Gosh, Maestro Kang is so unbelievable. We threw him a birthday party and filled in the empty slots for the choral symphony. How can he use and then dump us? I'm sure there's a reason for this. Then why didn't he show up? I bet it's because he felt guilty. Why is he going back and forth? Who does he think he is? Nero? How many times has this happened? He didn't completely abandon us. He's going to accept us if we perform well at the orchestra festival. We're supposed to perform, but we don't have enough people or a practice room. I'm broke. I used up most of my savings from working at the cabaret. I'll need a loan soon. Why don't we practice while making money? We should. I know everything about getting part-time gigs, so-- You're still so disrespectful. If that's your thing, go ahead. I'll just speak formally to you. You brat. Famous orchestras will be there. It will be hard even if we practice like crazy. How can I practice while working? I need to open my animal clinic again, so I won't have time-- What do you want, then? Should we throw in the towel? Should we give up? Why are you getting mad at us? Where did Maestro Kang's minions go? - Where did Ru-mi and Gun-woo go? - Right. Did they run away with Maestro Kang? - Do you have a place bigger than this? - Pardon? Well, this is the best and the biggest practice studio in this area. How many teams come here to practice in a week? They come every day. Six to seven teams rotate each day of the week. Tell them to practice someplace else. - I'll rent this place out for two months. - Sorry? Change the interior. It's so dreary. Hang up mirrors on this side of the wall, so I can correct their posture. What's this smell? Do you not clean this place? Hey, listen here! - Can I talk to you really quick? - Man... Let's go somewhere else. It stinks in there. Father, can you accommodate us? All we need is to do is practice for two months. We're going to celebrate mass here starting next week. It will be difficult... I see. Sorry for everything. KANG GUN-WOO When did you get here? Just now. Did you hear from Mr. Kim? Take care of everyone and participate in the orchestra festival. I'm asking the people who auditioned to fill in the missing seats, so you should meet up with them. Oh, I found a practice studio. - It's near, and it's pretty-- - I found one, too. You? How? It's not too hard. It's not a real practice studio. It's just a warehouse. If we clean it up a bit and get some furniture-- Why did you waste your money? Practice at the studio I booked. It has far better facilities-- We'll use the place I found. You put me in charge. Have you decided on the score? I'm looking. You know you can only play one piece, right? Give me a list of scores, and let me-- I'll take care of that, too. Did something happen to you? No. What's wrong all of a sudden? Why are you disobeying me? I'll discuss them with you, but I want to make the decision. I'll be the one conducting. So you want me to stop interfering? I want you to trust me since you put me in charge. Go home first. I'm going to the library to study. It's past 11 p.m. It's not past midnight. We've been waiting for two hours. We... We want to know why we were fired. Many people made a fuss about your qualifications. It wasn't you? I'm not too happy. Honestly, there's nothing to brag about regarding your bad qualifications. Mr. Kang. This isn't the first time-- Exactly. I want to silence them for good at the orchestra festival. That's easier said than done. Why don't you ask us to enter the Chopin competition? That's only for the piano. Get your facts straight. We talked amongst ourselves. We definitely understand how you feel, but we're discouraged because this keeps happening to us. We all have our shortcomings... Let me be straightforward with you. We voted four to six. We decided not to participate in the festival. We're going to quit everything. Stop. You know he's a very hot-tempered person, right? - I'm a cautious person. - Stay put. We were a bit hurt because we thought we became close to you. We... clicked. Did you really decide not to do it? That was the decision, but... We threw you a birthday party. So? Just because we're close, do you want me to overlook your limitations? If you threw me a birthday party twice, you would ask me to resign. Where did the person yelling, "I'm Jung Hui-yeon" go? Where did the person who didn't want to live like a maniac and played on the streets go? If you were going to give up, why did you yell and perform on the street? Was it all for show? You're comparing apples to oranges. This is different. How is it different? You're still Crap, Cabaret, and Dementia to me. Do the facts disappear just because we're close? Oh, one more fact will be added today. That "beggar" attitude, when you try to use your relationship to get the easy way out. "I can't do it because I don't have anyone who can guide me." These are the characteristics of a beggar. They have millions of excuses. They seek the easy way out by depending on others. I was wondering what those people looked like, and that's you! Asking people like that to participate in the festival? How absurd. It's a good thing you gave up. Beggars drink like that. Let's go. I think we're done here. I can't believe I once had faith in him. This isn't right. Something is wrong. As if! Oh, man. Damn it! Mr. Kang Gun-woo, let's put our titles aside and be honest with each other. Just think of me as your father and tell me your real thoughts. Do you want some? It's very good for dementia. Your master feels very crossed today. Are you acting? I think your master is behaving like that because he's afraid. You don't know how people will change their minds. They can like you, be disappointed in you, and have expectations from you. But you're scared when those feelings might change. It's unpredictable. That's why you're frightened. That's why your master only hangs out with dead people like Mozart and Beethoven. That's why he only deals with music. What are you doing? Your master is wrong about one thing. All that music was written when they were alive. Uncontrollable emotions? They're all in there. How can he understand the music if he's afraid of those emotions? An empty shell. Your master is just imitating music. He needs to be honest. Not to us, but to himself. Your master is deceiving his own emotions. Do you know what Bernard Shaw said before he died? He said he knew that everything would end while he wasted time and hesitated. Life is short. There's no time to hesitate. You must do everything honestly and with all your heart. Do you like me? Yes, you're far better than your master. FEISTY CHICKEN What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to earn money? I couldn't sleep at all last night. I was so resentful and furious! A beggar? Fine, let's participate in the festival. Let's have us beggars go up on stage with a banner and beg for money. We'll sing. Oh, yes, here comes the beggar Let's show him what we've got! I originally said I wanted to perform, so persuade the others. Really? Then who opposed it? Ju-hui and Ju-yeon will do whatever I ask them to do. I can persuade Jun-gi with my fist. I-deun, she's a tough one. I want to keep my distance. You're close to her, so you persuade her. Is that Hui-yeon? She says she'll perform, right? It's Mr. Kim. Maestro Kang wants to have dinner. Go ahead. We'll eat on our own. No, he wants us all to come. He's going to eat with us beggars? We'll double dip, so our saliva will mix together. How can a person who acts in a noble way accept that? I can't make it tonight. It's my wife's memorial. You should call everyone and go with them. No way! I'll pay my respects to your wife and have dinner with you. - I won't go! - Go. Maestro Kang is opening up. You should accept it. No, I'm not going. I don't feel like it. Who was that? Yong-gi. He wants to grab some drinks. - Let's do ten more. - Okay. I have to go and teach. Oh, that's right. Nam-ju's mom called to stop the private lessons. Really? I asked why, but she wouldn't give me an answer. She asked if you were okay. Did something happen at the city orchestra? Like what? She was slacking off, so I scolded her. I see. Let's extend the veranda once we have our second child. We'll be finished paying off this house by that time. - So we can fix it. - Sure. Bo-ra has so many books. We need to get her a bookcase. Bo-ra, Daddy needs to make a lot of money. Daddy, make a lot of money. Daddy. Aren't Ju-yeon and Ju-hui going? You don't know? Jeez, why are they being fickle? Honey, can you turn that down? You go, Yong-gi. I really don't have time. Honey, I can't hear! I'll think about it, but I really don't want to go. How can I eat with Maestro Kang? He's going to annoy me, and I'll just get indigestion. When are you going to order, sir? Sir, I want to know you. KANG GUN-WOO FEISTY CHICKEN 7 VOICE MESSAGES You have seven new voice messages. First message. Wow, you really aren't answering. Yes, don't pick up. I'm going to leave tons of voicemails. Where am I? Well... I'm in Seoul. I'm still in Seoul even though I biked for hours. At this rate, I wonder if I can make it to Daegwallyeong in a week. Wow, it feels so nice and comfortable, just yapping away since I'm not scared. Starting today, your voicemail inbox is my diary. Says who? Says me. I need to take revenge somehow. Second message. Mr. Kang, this place rocks. It's so great. I'm really glad I came here. You're doing well, right? I suppose so, since you're not answering your phone. It's so great. I wish I could share this scenery with you. Mr. Kang, I have blisters on my feet. They're bleeding. It hurts. There's nothing wrong, right? You were in my dream last night, but you didn't look too good. That's why I'm worried. You were eating by yourself. You're doing well, right? Gun-woo takes good care of you, right? I'll be done with my trip tomorrow. I'll be arriving at the park you mentioned, Sunny Hill Park, in the afternoon. I heard there's a picturesque tree on top of the hill. I'm going to take pictures and scream there. Right now, I'm listening to Liszt's "Liebestraum." It's so good. This was originally an aria. The original title is a lot better. "Love as Long as You Can." That's why I don't want to forget you. Your voice, your fingers, your scornful way of talking... I'm going to remember them all. I'm going to like you until they get tattered and old. Do you know what Bernard Shaw said before he died? He said he knew that everything would end while he wasted time and hesitated. Life is short. There's no time to hesitate. You must do everything honestly and with all your heart. {\an8}KANG GUN-WOO "The best" describes the noun. Read it. - Right? - It's not that. I give up. Let's do something else. If you say that, then you're saying, "the most famous building in Korea." - That's why... - Do all girls write like this? No, just me. It's called the Ru-mi font. Why, you... You're not going to study? Look here. Why are you laughing? KANG GUN-WOO Excuse me. Where is Sunny Tree? - It's over there. - Thank you. SWEET GUN-WOO Hi, Gun-woo. Where are you? I'm at Daegwallyeong. I'm almost at my destination. It's right in front of me. Maestro Kang likes you. He pretended he didn't like you because of me. Actually, he thinks of you a lot. But Gun-woo is in a tough spot right now. He's probably lonely. Please take care of him. It's done. Where in the world are we? What the heck? It stinks. - Everyone is here, right? - Why did you call us? Why did you ask us to come here? - Don't tell me... - Yes, it's our practice room. - What? - It stinks. Let's start from the beginning on our own. I like the idea, but the smell... Practicing where the cows are... MEAN GUN-WOO The person you are calling is not available. Please leave... Mr. Kang, this is Ru-mi. Is something wrong? Gun-woo told me... Jeez, who is it? Hello? Why aren't you coming? Who's this? You said you would remember everything. Did you forget already? You said you would be here by the afternoon. Why are you late? The afternoon starts after noon. Do you know what time it is? How can you do anything with this kind of attitude-- It's like a concert for the public by the best orchestras. Are you looking for a piano soloist? Tchaikovsky's "Piano Concerto No. 1." You're amazing! Go with this. It's Beethoven's "Piano Concerto No. 5." I'll handle it. No need for interpretation. I've already written it down. Just do exactly what it says. They were all fired? If they get good evaluations at the festival, they can come back. What are those people doing over there? Why are they selling music? Let's go, Mr. Kang. Why did she come with Maestro Kang? You don't have enough time to practice, but you're doing this? How can I... I told them to do it, sir. You exploit your orchestra members to make money? Are you a pimp? Ru-mi, are you going out with Maestro Kang? Ru-mi, what's going on? Sorry, Gun-woo. I played you a little. He's my pupil. Please keep this a secret. It's Gun-woo. You know nothing. I used to think you cared for us. But now, I really don't know. Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
