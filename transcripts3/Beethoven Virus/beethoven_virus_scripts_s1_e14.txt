 He's... the jerk. {\an8}You haven't aged in the past ten years. {\an8}What do you think classical music is? {\an8}I think it's bullshit. {\an8}I don't like classical music. {\an8}Why do you hate classical music? Why? Tell me why! A conductor only waves his arms in the air anyway. Just put him on the podium the day of the concert and forget about him. {\an8}They say ignorance is bliss. - Conducting is-- - Hurry, come in.

 The important thing is what you want to convey to the audience. The emotions. Just by his conducting... Look at how we've changed. This was the first time in my life I felt that music was beautiful. Fine, I'll let you do it. Orchestra leader? Conducting. - I'll just keep it as a dream. - A dream? How can it be a dream if you don't strive for it? That's a star. That's something high in the sky, something out of reach and unattainable. I'm not telling you to realize your dream.

 At least dream of realizing it. My place is here. I want to be together with these people. How much aspiration is burning inside of you? But there are people who do better when they enjoy what they're doing. What are you doing? Give me a chord! Ti, do, re, mi flat, fa sharp, la flat! I can't believe he wasted his talent all this time. That dumbass. Aim higher for what? What I want is to conduct, not become a city orchestra member! I wanted to be a backup member so I could study, go to college, and learn how to conduct! Gun-woo is a musical genius. I don't want to acknowledge it, but it's true. He's a crazy bastard. He's gifted and courageous. Mozart is his rival. He needs someone to lead him. But not a person like me who's biased, egotistical, and stubborn. If he hangs around me, he's going to become like me. An outsider conductor. Eternally an A minor. After becoming a wonderful conductor, I'm going to go see Mr. Jung and say you were the one who taught me, that you were the reason I am what I am. That the best conductor in the world isn't Jung Myeong-hwan, but... Maestro Kang Gun-woo. I'm going to tell the whole world. Am I a freak? You sure are. Do I have a crappy personality? Yes, you have a crappy personality. Am I a lowlife jerk? A lowlife jerk? Didn't you know you were a jerk? You didn't know for the past 40 years? Take all of my conducting techniques, but not my temper. He told me I could achieve something and shine. Maestro Kang is the one who had faith in me when I gave up on myself. I think I like Gun-woo. Not the young, cute, nice, and handsome Gun-woo. Maestro Kang likes you. He pretended he didn't like you because of me. Actually, he thinks of you a lot. But the old, nasty, selfish, twisted, and mean Gun-woo. It's done. Go with this. It's Beethoven's "Piano Concerto No. 5 'Emperor.'" - I'll listen and interpret it. - No need for interpretation. I've already written it down. Just do exactly what it says. Can't a score change according to the conductor's interpretation? Didn't I tell you there's no need for interpretation? You need to know the basics to interpret! You picked up conducting a few months ago! How dare you change... Did you want to be cool that badly? Did you want to compensate for being dumped by acting cool? You didn't want to be a crybaby because of love, so you pretended to act cool but it was killing your ego, and you wanted to be compensated. Mr. Kang. Didn't you purposely want to force a difference so you can spite me and prevail? - I've been very patient. - Who told you to be patient? Just let it out! Get rid of the notion that you need to be nice and cool! How can you do music when you're bottled up? Do whatever your instinct tells you to do! Just let your determination, desperation, anger, and frustration out! Thank you, sir. For the first time, I want to beat you. Mr. Kang. Aren't you going to perform? I believe it's time. Excuse me? Gun-woo, why didn't you come see Maestro Kang's performance? I had some things on my mind. How was his performance? Was it good? It was awesome. What else would we expect? - He's still very talented. - True. But did you see the look on his face? He looked upset, right? That score was pretty serious, so the overall mood was serious. But he didn't have to look like he stepped on crap. All the crap left. - You're at it again. - I'm sorry. It's our turn to perform. Here he comes. Here comes Mr. Kang. - When's your next performance? - Are you happy with your performance? Everyone thought it was good. What do you think? Sir, can you please say something? Let's go to the outdoor concert venue. There will be a performance there too. You should go. - Outdoor performance? - Where? Dad. Thanks for coming. Gosh. Didn't Mr. Kang Gun-woo accompany you? I was just with him. He must've gone somewhere else. He doesn't like to socialize with others. Were you like this to Ru-mi? Did you say that when Ru-mi completely lost her hearing? Maestro Kang is here. Ms. Seo Hae-kyeong? She's going to play the piano? How is such a famous pianist playing with them? Maestro Kang had asked her to play. We'll be performing Tchaikovsky's "Piano Concerto No.1." This score has a very famous story to it. He first showed this song to his close friend, Nikolai Rubinstein. But Rubinstein dismissed the concerto as trash. He said it was awkward, clumsy, and unplayable. He even said if he didn't change it to the way he recommended, it would be destined to fail. In other words, he completely disregarded and insulted Tchaikovsky. But Tchaikovsky didn't make any changes. The premiere of the unchanged score was a resounding success. I'd also like to show you according to my instincts, with my bare hands, what raw music is. Amazing. He still needs to work on his technique, but that can be learned. - Isn't he Maestro Kang's pupil? - Yes. That's odd. His style is very different from his teacher's. Actually, he seems better. Maestro Kang is outstanding when it comes to accurately interpreting a score, but he lacks emotional abundance. It feels repressed. It seems a bit stuffy, as if he suppresses emotions. But that kid isn't bottled up. Although Seo Hae-kyeong is leading well, the conductor seems fearless, perhaps because of his young age. It's remarkable that he's showing his candid emotions. He's better than Maestro Kang? It's like comparing apples to oranges, but emotionally, he's definitely better. My goodness. Maestro Kang has raised a tiger. - What are you doing? - We're working. The city told us to build a temporary billboard. There are plenty of other places. Can't you see a performance is going on? They said to build it here. It must be urgent. We're subcontractors. If you have complaints, tell the mayor yourself. I'd like to talk to Mayor Kang Chun-bae. Please hang on. Don't cry. It's okay. Yes, what can I do for you? There's construction going on at the outdoor concert venue right now. Pardon? What construction? For the first time, I want to beat you. He's better than Maestro Kang? Emotionally, - he's definitely better. - Please speak, Mr. Kang. There's construction going on at the outdoor concert venue right now. Well, we needed to build it at once, but there wasn't a suitable place. I told them to build it there, but I didn't know about the concert. Sir? Sir, say something. Stop the construction. Now! Move! We're performing right now! Be quiet, will you? What are you doing? Are you trying to ruin our performance? Can't you see you're interrupting our performance? Can't you? We couldn't continue because of you! Hey! There's a concert going on! Stop it! SEOKRAN COMMUNITY NEWSLETTER It wasn't mentioned in any of the papers. Only one critic made a comment. He talked about a young conductor, Kang Gun-woo who performed at the outdoor concert venue, and so on. He wrote that Gun-woo is fresh, provocative, and ambitious because there was nothing else to say. Oh, here's the most important part. "It was a disaster." "Although his fresh and ambitious interpretation was good, his performance was a disaster because of his lack of experience regarding how to respond to an unexpected situation." What do you think? Didn't he still get a comment? Aren't you a logical person? You need to take responsibility for what you said. Yes, it was my mistake for ordering the billboard construction. I didn't know there was a concert, but I thought you had consented. You called me, but didn't you only listen to what I said? You didn't push me to stop the construction. Wasn't that consent? I don't know what happened, but let's forget about it. Let's move on to a new city orchestra. You know the mayoral election is coming up, right? While campaigning, let's get the people's votes through music... No, I mean, what about gathering the people's minds? "Flourish as the city of music! I'm candidate number one Kang Chun-bae." I declined to write a column, but I change my mind. - I've just decided what to write. - Go ahead. Seokran, the city of music, interrupted a classical performance for marketing. It will go out on the cultural page next week. Didn't you agree by not saying-- Then I'll add both the mayor of Seokran and conductor Kang Gun-woo hindered a classical performance. Satisfied? What is wrong with you? What do you want? Man. You're one or the other! You're either pompous or stupid. Don't be cocky. You're still in the palm of my hand. Didn't I tell you there's no need for interpretation? You need to know the basics to interpret! You picked up conducting a few months ago! How dare you change... If you keep doing whatever you feel like doing, you'll mess up the concert-- Hello? I'm calling from Square Technology. I called to offer you a great offer. Yes, I know your situation, but everyone's in a pickle. - At a time like this, we should-- - Yes, I know. That's why I wanted to leave without making a scene, but he suddenly-- "Hyeok-gwon is running away"? Am I some kind of a fugitive? You should've texted that you were quitting then. Everyone gathered to come up with a plan but you freaking started to pack up your stuff. "Freaking"? You're always so crude. Okay, fine. Let's have a meeting. What are we going to talk about? Go ahead. See? Nothing to say? Don't have a plan? We have no hope. We're thinking. Can't you give us some time? What about your contest? Go practice and don't butt into adults' affairs. You bring age up when you have nothing to say. I was about to go practice. Okay, I-deun. Go practice and call us if you need help with something. Confidence is key. Okay... Let's talk about the cause. I think we were fantastic before the construction started. The audience was mesmerized and moved. The pianist was unbelievable. Violin, oboe, trombone, trumpet and the contrabass which I was worried about were all great. Yes, it was amazing. Did you see the audience's expression? They were enchanted. Exactly! But once the construction began, we messed up. We messed up because of the construction! Isn't there a saying for this? Anyhow, it's because of the construction. Construction that's done at any time of the day, construction where they dig the ground... Korea's building industry messed up our concert! Why do you think Emperor Qin Shihuang was ruined? It's because he built the Great Wall of China! What do you think Maestro Kang would've done? Maestro Kang would've stopped the concert. He would've called the mayor or threatened the workers to leave and then restarted the concert. Then our concert would've been a success and I bet we would be signing our orchestra contracts right now. My, you're so mean. Why are you bringing that up again? Did I bring it up? I said it because I was told to talk about the cause when I was about to leave. Then were you hiding it? Gun-woo was great, - and he did his best. - I know. I know he was running around like crazy. When he refused to accept Maestro Kang's money... I was a bit angry, but I considered it as youthful follies. Score interpretation? Conducting? Gosh, it was awesome. In some aspects, he's better than Maestro Kang. But one thing. Wisdom. Experience. You can't get that in a day. It's separate from talent. It's because he's still very young. But oh well, these are the results. Are you saying we need to age Gun-woo or what? He's young! You're talking nonsense. Fine, tell me how he can look old just like you! - Hello? - Please don't hang up. I'm calling from Square Technology. I called to give you some good investment advice. Hey, if it's that good, why don't you invest yourself? Wait, hang on. I'm not asking you to invest. We want to invest in you. The president of the company wants to talk to you. Hang on. This test is the oldest test to determine a conductor's abilities. It appears in Wagner's operas. You, what's the title? Didn't I tell you in our last class? Don't sleep in class! Behind her. Today's my first conducting class. How come? I'm just auditing this class. I graduated from this school. What did you major in? - Violin. - Why are you taking a conducting class? I have a hearing problem. But I don't want to give up on music. Is it impossible? Invest in us? - Yes. - Ru-mi. Don't interrupt him after coming late. Sit and listen with us. Okay. They're going to sponsor our orchestra? Why would they do that? They saw our performance. The president of their company is a classical music fanatic. They wanted to improve their company image by sponsoring an organization, and saw us. But why us? Aren't there plenty of other organizations? Did you look into this? Are you sure they're a reputable company? They seem pretty reliable. You know the editor-in-chief of The Classic? He recommended us. They knew all about our lack of experience. I even talked to the president. He used to do music, so he knows what it's like. But why would they give us hundreds of millions of won? I doubt they'll just give it to us. What are the conditions? If we're chosen, we'll have to put up their name during our concerts. That's a given. They want to see us perform again. You know the concert at the Arts Hall next month? They'll make a decision after watching us perform there. They're just trying to get our hopes up because they're bored. I knew it was too good to be true. See? Ultimately, they want to test us and make a decision. How strange. What's up with you guys? Why can't we take the test? No, of course, we can but-- We performed really well right until the construction. But why are you saying we can't do it this time around? The concert will be indoors. We don't have to worry about construction or acoustics. The mood will be great. Why? Why can't we do it? We need to audition in order to perform. Only the teams that make it can perform. We'll make it. What's the big deal? You're not confident? Because you're the reason the concert bombed? Ru-mi! Gun-woo's not confident. Shall we get a new conductor? We can't do that. Why not? I'll do it. Hey. It's not like we can afford another conductor. We'll have to choose among ourselves. I used to lead my college orchestra. I've conducted before. Unlike him, I won't let my pride dictate since I'm older and experienced. Hey, Hyeok-gwon. No. Hey, Park. If you're going to do it, then I-- He's talented, so I may not be as good as he is, but I can always brown-nose and learn from Maestro Kang. How about it? Me or him? There are things that cannot be learned. Let's decide by a show of hands. Who's for me as the conductor? Who's for Kang Gun-woo? Me. They want you, so what's it going to be? They're so dumb, don't you think? That's why we're the Dumbo Orchestra. We need to change our name. How can we trust him? There's no one else who can conduct. We have no choice. Yes, he's way better than Hyeok-gwon. If Park conducted, he would get pissed off all the time. He'd be like Maestro Kang II without the talent. - No eye candy either. - What? It's better to have someone young. Conductor, say a few words. I'll swallow my pride. Thank you. - Hooray for our conductor! - Hooray! What is it? So... You know the suggestion about the chamber orchestra and... Well, campaigning begins next week. That's why the mayor is a bit sensitive. And the media questions the purpose of having the city orchestra. So he was wondering if you could just choose one. No, we have to do both. Hang on, sir. What are your real intentions? I've assisted many important people for years, so I pick up on things quickly. So... You know, when you called about the construction and didn't stop it, I felt like you weren't too pleased with the backup members-- You're on the money. They said Gun-woo was better than me. So I wished for their concert to be ruined. I see. Is that unacceptable? I'm human. I did music for decades, but they said my six-month pupil was better. Can't I show some anger? Well, sure... That's true. I'm going to make a chamber orchestra. It's not final, but I told the mayor. They'll perform and teach at elementary schools and poor communities. You don't need to be all that talented, so you should join if you're interested. You should be thankful with gratitude. What's with the hesitation? Is it because of your ego? I'm very thankful, but I've already agreed to do something else. What is it? A company wants to help us. It's not final, but there's a possibility of being a private orchestra. - I'd like to try-- - You're willing to get help from a company you don't know but not from me? I'll think about it, but they gave us an offer first. - And I've already talked to the others-- - What's the problem? Ru-mi? Yes. I cried when I got dumped by Ru-mi. I cried myself to sleep. But yesterday, I couldn't sleep. How can I sleep when all those people can't make a living because of me? Then what? Is it because of me? - Sir, you're a bit serious-- - Is it because of me? That's... It's not that. Just be honest with me. What's my problem? Problem? I don't understand what-- Tell me. Sir, why are you-- You know me well as well as I know you. Don't lie to me. I was frustrated. The basics and your interpretation are all good. But it wasn't me. I can't conduct something I don't understand. You kept on forcing me, so I felt like a scarecrow. I felt suffocated like a caged bird. I felt like I was better than you in emotional aspects, but you seemed to be stopping me. No. - I doubt you did that-- - I did stop you. I clipped your wings. Sir, I didn't use the right words. You don't have to call me sir. Go. I'll set you free. Sir, I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to make you angry. Gun-woo. I'm not mad. I think this is the best way for both of us. Two people who disagree can't be teacher and pupil. Don't you agree? Mr. Kang, why are you doing this? You're not the one who should get mad! You get mad when I'm honest and when I'm not! What do you want me to do? How much longer will you kill my pride for you to be satisfied? If you look at it as one, the eight-bar theme is written in the front. Looking at the theme, I want you to see what the idea is and what inspired the idea. If you look at that for instance, it's an A major with three sharps. As you can see. And it's consisted of... NEW MESSAGE Come to my office. I'm busy. Were you surprised? I've always wanted to text you like that. It felt good. But I really am busy. I started something new, and we'll be practicing all night. May I come visit later when I have time? No, don't come. So then the entire factor can... It's good. But something's a bit... It isn't you, but the arrangement. Can you change it like that? Aren't we supposed to play it like the original? It's not a traditional classical concert, so wouldn't it be okay? I asked, and they said it was fine. I think the arrangement is weird. Let me revise this, so practice on your own - in the meantime. - Okay. Are things not going well? It's just... It'll be too slow if we stay true to the original score. What about this? - Did you change it? - Yes. I've been taking music composition classes lately. That's why I changed it as practice. I think it's because we're not utilizing the flute. The flute is leading the canto. But the main melody remains the same while the tempo is faster. Wouldn't be too much if we change the canto? - Hey, this is good. - Right? I just added a few trills to make it sound Bohemian. Yes, it's good. Then for this part here... What if you slightly change the rhythm for the horn? No, that's not right. The horn needs to cover the entire sound but if it plays on its own, the effect will diminish. Is that so? Why don't you change the main part then? Okay I-deun! Hello. Bo-ra. Well... I'm sorry for coming unannounced. But I'm really worried about my husband. I thought so. I doubt you came because of your daughter. About the concert... It didn't go well. Then the members being reinstated at the city orchestra... It's over. It can't be done. Is something wrong? No, I'm fine. We were about to buy a house... We were going to buy the place we rent. But we missed the date for paying the deposit. The owner was really nice so she postponed it for us, but... - We don't have any income-- - Let's just cut to the chase. - I had already discussed with you about-- - But the thing is, we'll be having our second child any day now. - I don't know what to-- - Hang on. Kid, don't touch that. Don't touch that, either. Sir, play me "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star". No. Can I ride that then? That's a dog, not a horse. Mom! Mom! Dad! Ma'am? That's odd. I'm not due for another ten days. What's Hyeok-gwon's number? It's 367... - The baby's coming! - Ma'am. - It's coming. - Tell me the number once again. The baby's coming! Ma'am. Do you know your dad's number? The baby's coming! Oh my gosh! You should feel bad for two hours since you were two hours late. You didn't tell them I was going to be late? He had an urgent private lesson to teach. You should've postponed it. Did you have to teach during practice? It was the only time he had. What should I do? Should I starve to death? How could you say that? When did I tell you to starve? I'm sorry. Satisfied? Hey, let's start. Yong-gi. What's his problem? Hyeok-gwon. Park, what's the matter? I need to pay the deposit for my house next week. I'll be having my second child soon, but I don't have an income. I can't get an advance for the private lessons. That's why I signed a contract to play for a trot singer. What's his name? Anyhow, for a famous person. Satisfied? You should've told me. I could've gotten you a job at Don't Tell Papa. What? Are you making fun of me? No, I'm saying it for your sake-- Are you telling me to work at a cabaret like you? What's wrong with working at a cabaret? A cabaret is a place where common folks relieve stress. A cabaret is a place where dance and music meet. - Don't disrespect cabarets. - I went to music school! Hyeok-gwon! I used to work for a company not too long ago! I used to work at Don't Tell Papa. Yong-gi. I got into the city orchestra after auditioning fair and square-- Yes. Maestro Kang's a bastard for not doing anything when I got fired. But you want me to work at a cabaret? Do you think I'm on the same level as you? A cabaret's not a bad place. Working at a cabaret is nothing to be proud of, but I'm not ashamed! I won't tolerate it if you look down on me for working at a cabaret. I don't know what I'll do, you jerk! - Yong-gi. - What? - What's with you guys? - Yes, it's all my fault! I don't know why I even chose you when you first came to audition! - Do you want to be hit with this? - What? - You want to see blood? - Hit me, you jerk! - Don't disrespect me! - Hey. - Stop! - Hit me, you jerk! Hello? What? What did you say? Okay. Hyeok-gwon. Hyeok-gwon! Hyeok-gwon, your wife is in labor! - What? - Your wife is in labor. Gosh. It hurts so much. It hurts so much. Help her with her breathing. Mom. Mom. Breathing is important. Follow after me. Breathe in, and breathe out. Where's her husband? He needs to get here soon. Do you want to go into the delivery room? No. It hurts so much. It hurts so much. It hurts so much. It hurts so much. Stop! Excuse me. Where's Hwang Yeong-hui? - She's in room 810. - Yes. - I see. Room 810? Thanks. - Sure. Are you okay? I'm fine after seeing the baby. Nice room. Gosh. I can tell you're worried about the cost. Just smile. Don't you feel bad for the baby? What? It's nice. Get some sleep. No. Shall we go visit the baby? Can you handle it? I need to move around to speed up the recovery. Okay. So cute. - Isn't he cute? - Yes. My gosh. - What a relief. - Is that really your baby? - So cute. - You don't look like your daddy. - It's such a relief. - It's a total relief. - The baby smiled. - Didn't it wink? - The baby's winking at us. - So cute. Be quiet. The baby will cry. Stop pushing, lady. So Yong-gi looked like that once too? No way! The baby doesn't look like him. - Thank goodness. - I know. - Dad! - Yes? - Bo-ra. - Mom! - Bora. Okay. - Dad! Hyeok-gwon, you can come to work starting Monday. Really? You made a great decision, sir. Does that mean we can all start work on Monday-- Hyeok-gwon was fired unfairly, but not you guys. You messed up the concert, so there's no way. I had to give up on the chamber orchestra to get Hyeok-gwon reinstated. Good luck with your corporate sponsorship. We'll have to continue practicing in the barn. Okay. Ru-mi. Ru-mi. Sir, when did you get here? Is that a hearing aid? Since when could you not hear? Let me drop this off first. How long has it been? It's been a while. My hearing goes in and out. I still have hearing in one ear, so it's okay if I put my hearing aid on. I can get by. Why didn't you tell me? You don't like it when people depend on you. I want to learn how to compose. I'm taking classes at my alma mater. I started not too long ago, but it's really fun. I slightly rearranged the score we're going to audition with. Gun-woo even complimented me. He didn't say everything was great, but a little. Compose? How can you compose when you can't hear? Are you Beethoven? I know there are musicians with disabilities. Those people are talented, but what about you? Aren't you accomplished because you made an effort? So if I were to work hard then-- Hey, Ru-mi. I know you're in a miserable situation, but don't compare me to you. Do you think I'm where I am just because I worked hard even without talent? You need to go for it when you see a possibility. Do you think you can be Picasso if you picked up painting when you were bored one day? It's not because I'm bored. It's because I think it's unfair. Gun-woo didn't know he was talented for 25 years, and he's making strides. Even though I like music, I have no talent, and I'm going deaf. It's so unfair. What do you want? Sympathy? Those methods don't work on me now. I may be humbled after I try. But I'll be the one who'll be disappointed and humbled. So don't worry about me. What classes are you taking? Theory of Harmony. What grade did you get for it when you were in school? C+. I can't believe you. If you're going to do it, do it right. You also need to take counterpoint, music theory, principle instrument, ensemble, and music analysis. Okay. Even with music composition classes, I'll play the violin until I go deaf. Are you planning on messing up the orchestra? The reason why I'm doing it is because I want to play with you one last time. Mr. Kang. There must be something I'm good at, right? That's why I was born into this world, right? I just haven't found it yet, that's all. Right? Grandpa, I'm going to use this score for my competition. What do you think? Do you think it's okay? We're going to audition for the Arts Hall soon. If we make it and do well at the concert, we'll get a corporate sponsorship. Then we can become a hotshot private orchestra. Don't you think it's great? Grandpa, I'm talking more courteously. Can't you look at me? I'll be back. I'm the soloist today. I wish you'd wish me luck. Yes, but she has a handicap for composing music. She can't hear very well. It's not just bad. She's about to lose her hearing-- Yes, that's true because she can feel it with her fingers. Yes, imagination. So you're saying there's a possibility? Yes, thank you. Bye. Mr. Kang, are you awake? Today's the audition for that corporate sponsorship. There will be a concert at Arts Hall. Only those who pass the audition can perform, so... Mr. Kang, I'm sorry. Can you please forgive me? I was out of line. I made you breakfast. Please eat it. Why are all these people here at the Arts Hall? Why does politics have to meddle with fine arts? He's better than him. Absolutely. If Choi becomes mayor, he'll get rid of the city orchestra. It's rumored he's going to tear down Arts Hall too. - No way. - It's true. We can make it, right? Most definitely. It's not a competition. They want to know whether we're concert material or not. Yes, who are we? Corporations are dying to sponsor us. Only if we didn't mess up that concert... You big mouth. Must you bring that up? Others will mess up, right? I-deun always talks in opposites. Opposites. Oh my gosh, it's 4 p.m. Gun-woo. I have to pay the electric bill at the bank. Pay it later. We have to be on standby right now. I can't. Do you know how much the late fee is? The bank's right here, so I'll be right back. Watch my cello for me. - Sure. Hurry back! - Hurry back. We should go in now. Yong-gi! You can't do anything without me! Give it! - Here you go. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - Bye. DEPOSIT Oh, my. Da-won's mom. Aren't you Da-won's mom? What brings you here? I came to watch a movie, but I had to pay my electric bill. Oh, me too. - You two came to watch a movie? - Yes. I'm here to audition. Didn't I tell you I'm in an orchestra? What were you doing earlier? Did you have tea before coming here? No, I practiced all morning. See? It wasn't her. Why? What's the matter? - We had tea at our neighborhood. - Okay. But we saw your husband having tea with another woman. I thought it was you from the back. Who could it have been? Vibrato. Hey, what are you doing right now? I'm trying to kill my nerves. Stop it already and go have a seat. Who are you calling? - The person you have reached... - What's his problem? We just got a bad judge. It's okay. What is going on here? Everyone's crying. That chubby man didn't cry. Didn't you see how red his eyes were? He was clearly holding it in. Next up is Mouse Philharmonic! Okay, everyone. Cheer up! - How about a cheer before we begin? - Good idea. Okay. Good. Who are we? - Mouse Philharmonic. - Mouse Philharmonic. - I can't hear you. - Louder! - Who are we? - Mouse Philharmonic! - And Mouse Philharmonic is? - Like weeds! - And weeds are? - Strong! 35TH ANNUAL CONCERT FOR THE PEOPLE AUDITION Hello. I'm Kang Gun-woo, conductor of the Mouse Philharmonic... Mouse Philharmonic? Go ahead and play. There are principles to style! Give him your baton. Ru-mi. Step out. Your interpretation is also subjective. No, since you played energetically earlier... Play according to the original score? My music has changed! It's getting destroyed! This will be my daughter's debut performance. She's the main focus. "A Goose's Dream"? Isn't this a pop song? The mayor wants us to do something. How dare you treat us like a recorder in your house? You're going to regret this if Choi Seok-gyun really becomes mayor! Assemblyman Choi is going to be mayor. - What? - Is that true? Ru-mi. I can't conduct you. So please help me. I think it's best that we don't see each other. Are you instructing me? I'm ordering you. The new mayor wants to fire you. He wants to kick you out! Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
