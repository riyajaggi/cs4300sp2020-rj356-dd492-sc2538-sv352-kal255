 Mr. Kang! {\an8}What are you doing during our practice? Do you know? {\an8}Assemblyman Choi Seok-gyun, I mean the new mayor, {\an8}made a petition with the committee. It's a petition for you to step down, Mr. Kang. He wants... to fire you. He wants to kick you out! Let's go from bar 22. Mr. Kang.

 Assemblyman Choi must be bored after the election. Tell him I'll hang out with him after practice. Okay. Excuse me. My goodness. I'm sorry. Assemblyman Choi is really busy. He wants you to wait for just a while longer. Gosh. It's already lunchtime. He's busy with people asking him for favors and stuff. Didn't you see someone go in with a huge gift earlier? But I'll never ask him for a favor even though he's going through my funds right now as political revenge. But I'll never ask him--

 Mayor Choi, I look forward to working with you. Thank you. Then let's... Let's go eat. Look here! Can't you see I was waiting for you-- Didn't you want to see me at 11:30 a.m.? As courtesy, I waited for 30 minutes, but it must not have been important. I'll be leaving. Do you know about the petition for your dismissal? Dismissal? Who? Mr. Kang? Look here! I created the orchestra. How dare you-- You overestimate your abilities. I'm not a person you can fire because you feel like it. The Deliberation Committee needs to approve it. Look here. What the heck is that level five civil servant babbling about? Perform well at the inauguration. That will determine your fate. Sir, you can't just leave like this. - You should at least say something. - Say something? Speaking is what you do to a human being. That's true. Tell him not to fuss with the petition to dismiss because I'll quit. Sure. As a human being, I'll let him know. Heard that? Mr. Kang! You're going to quit? Yes. Mail this off to the mayor at once. Fire me? How dare he fire me? What? Did you know the city hasn't distributed our monthly paycheck yet? It's already been a week. What about your promise about getting us overtime pay and bonuses on time? Fine, I'll resolve your money issues, but I'll resign as soon as it's settled. If you resign, the city orchestra will be at stake. True. It was created for me anyway. - So you're going to quit? - Yes. I'm the one who established the city orchestra, and I'll be the one closing it. You're awesome. There's no getting fired in my book. You're really awesome. By yourself. - Oh my! - Oh my god! Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. - Oh my. Did you get hurt? - Goodness. - Sorry. - It's okay. Bye. Anyhow, I haven't had anything to eat all day. I'll be right over after I eat a little snack. Okay, bye. That's 1,000 won, right? You're 100 won short. Pardon? Just give me a bill. Well... This is for my dues. What should I do? Gosh. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Let me carry that for you. Thank you. - Keep going. - Okay. You must be going on a picnic. Yes. What's your husband doing by making you buy this when it's hard for you to walk? I just bought it because I wanted to feed him. I see. You must be happily married. Give it to me. - He's over there. - Sure, here you go. - Thank you. - No problem. Wait. Aunt, are you going to keep doing that? Sorry. Yong-gi. Didn't I ask you to do the tonguing correctly on the 80th bar? It's already the third time. Did I mess up again? My bad. - Sorry about that. - What's the use of practicing if you can't get it right? {\an8}I want you to pay attention! {\an8}Where are you, honey? Right, I'm doubly sorry. Ju-hui. You haven't corrected your electric playing habit yet? Do you think this is a place for you to come up and dance? Hey, what do you mean by dance? You're a bit harsh. I refrained from mentioning you hip-swaying and hair-flipping. Hey, man. What the heck's your problem? Lately, you've been very rude. It's because you don't get it! Can't you do it right if I'm asking nicely? How much longer do I have to be the nice guy? Ju-hui, if you're going to keep that up, just wear your sparkly clothes. If Yong-gi wears his cabaret clothes, you can be the glittering couple! I can't believe you! I told you I'm going to the go club. Stop bringing up the cabaret. I'm being patient because I know you're very sensitive these days. Let's take a ten-minute break. Rest for what? Sit down! Aren't you going to practice? Why you asshole... - What? - Come here! - What did I do? - You little twerp. - You think I'm goofing off? - What? - Don't you have manners? - Why do I have to do all the work? - You're so rude! - I need to get it out. - You jerk. - Let go of me. I didn't know about that. If he was cheating on me with a pretty young girl, then I could understand that was why. But she looked ten years older than me and was poorly dressed. That means he wasn't enamored by her appearance. That means his heart left. Oh dear. I'll get my stuff and go home. You should go to school. I'm okay. I won't spit at you. Don't cry too much. Go. Gun-woo, I have a class... Today's your composition class, right? Go ahead. I wonder whether you'll like or hate me saying this, but... I think... you're becoming like Maestro Kang. Is that a compliment? Thanks. But... You're only learning his bad traits. I don't know what it's like to be a genius. What I liked most about you was that you never left anyone behind. You wouldn't fire someone for being bad. You tried to help everyone succeed. Even if it took a long time, you would explain everything. What's with you lately? Mr. Kang told me to be meaner. Besides, this is the only opportunity we have. What if we mess up? It's over for us. What's dae sun yeol? It's the opposite of melody. It performs a subordinate role. In English, it's countermelody. What's the music you're hearing right now? Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier." That's right. If this is the melody, how can you make a countermelody off of it? Listen carefully. How can you embellish without messing up the melody? This is the countermelody test. It's the oldest test to determine your composition skills. Who wants to go first? What about you? - Me? - Yes, you're the oldest. Come on out. Do you know how to play the piano? Only if I need to play the melody. Okay, make a countermelody to the melody I'm about to play. What's that? It's my hearing aid. You need to have a creative mind to compose or arrange music. Imagine that you're walking in a beautiful forest. Try to make someone follow you. Countermelody. Not bad. But your countermelody is a bit fierce. The guy must have a bad temper. Go on in. Okay, next. You. You're up. Did you know Maestro Kang is getting ready to resign? Why did you come here? You're going to resign? I was going to text you my farewell. Get out. I don't care because I already deleted your number. - Aren't you ashamed? - What? I don't expect you to stay after hiring all those people because you're selfish. But are you really not ashamed of yourself? Do you know what kind of mayor he is? He has no concept of arts and culture. I can't fight him. It's futile. How can music beat politics? That's an excuse. You know that's an excuse. Right? So you want me to fight knowing I'm going to lose? You want to see me ruin my reputation and get fired nonetheless? No. I don't want to see that. - Then what? - However, more than anything, I don't want to see you run away lying. I can understand if you're running away for the sake of music. Because I know you truly want to maintain your sense of style. That's why I left. But this time, you're deceiving yourself and running away. You're lying that you're not ashamed about abandoning the city orchestra that was created for you, with people you personally hired. Didn't you want my help? This is my way of helping you. But... I might regret my decision for making you stay when I see you get hurt. But... I want you to be true to yourself. Because that's the person I liked. Have a seat. I'm busy. Let's cut to the chase. Will you be performing at the inauguration? If you will, I'll settle all the outstanding issues including the orchestra members' paychecks. You'll receive an even more outstanding treatment and pay. In other words, I want you to side with me. Let's be on the same team. It's a good song. Let's get along, Mr. Kang. There's an inaugural performance at 10 a.m. at the civic center on Monday. We'll be performing two pieces. The second piece is "My Way," the mayor's favorite song. Mr. Kang. I'm in the process of rearranging it. Including the national anthem, it'll be three pieces. Mr. Kang. Let's be reborn according to the new era by having a new attitude! That's... - No... - Is that really Maestro Kang? I heard he was sick. Did he hurt his head? This is... Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang. Well... When I said you were cool all by yourself, I didn't mean you should perform at the inauguration. I know you didn't want me to resign. That means you want me to stay, but I can only do that if I perform at the inauguration. I mean... You should resign then. And run... Not run away. Just forget everything. No. I'm going to become a mess. I want to try being low and dirty. What did he say? What did he say? - Really? Maestro Kang did that? - I'm telling you. I heard when I dropped by to bring their baby some formula since she's adorable unlike her dad. Maestro Kang will be performing three pieces at the inauguration ceremony including the national anthem. One song will be "My Way." The famous song everyone knows. "My Way." No way. What are you looking at? I paid expensive bus fare to get this intel. Reimburse me. What's the matter? - Don't be mean to Gun-woo. - He said we're double sparkles. Maestro Kang would never do such a thing. I bet the negotiations with the mayor were misrepresented-- What do you mean negotiating? The time, date, place, and schedule are all printed. How could Maestro Kang be the mayor's servant? - That's absurd. - That's what I want to believe too, but he's already started arranging the music. I bet he's going to say, "I can't do it," at the most crucial moment. - You think? - Definitely. - Most definitely, he'll do that. - That's right. What? Can't Mr. Kang do stuff like that? You think he doesn't eat or take a crap? Can't he be enticed and want to live a comfortable life? You want to give Mr. Kang a bad rep now? He's human too. He'll ruin you if you're getting too good, and he can hate you! Yes, I know of the down payment date. Of course. But my husband just started to work for the city orchestra. And they're having problems... Pardon? By next week? Okay, I'll do whatever it takes. I'm really sorry. Bo-ra, let's see what Mom did while you were gone. Did she make you a snack? Oh, she's sleeping. Didn't you say she slept earlier? Mom only sleeps these days. Really? Mom must not be in a good mood these days. Moms get depressed after giving birth to a baby. You call that postpartum depression. "Postpart"? Postpartum depression. "Postpart"? It's okay. You don't have to know. Bo-ra. Go wash your hands. Nice and clean. Hi, Gun-woo. Good thing you called. Is something going on with Maestro Kang lately? - I called because of that. - Hey, you live with him. I haven't seen him in a while. But is he really going to perform at the inauguration? Who knows? Things are hectic because of that. Rumor has it that Maestro Kang is Mayor Choi's servant, he wants to go into politics, he wants to be the Minister of Culture. But it's all nonsense. Hey, he used to be so strict and unwavering, so it's kind of scary to see him change. But the funny thing is, we're not practicing. We can't just wing the inaugural performance. Actually, we should show an outstanding performance. What's the matter with him? I have no idea. He went to have dinner with Mayor Choi. They weren't holding hands, but they were laughing and joking around. What? I have a buzz now. I'll take care of the orchestra members' paychecks. Let's go. Mr. Kang, I'm leaving. Good luck. Bye. I brought the car. I'll take you home. You're not really doing the inauguration performance, right? You're a person who can't lie about music. Can you really do a performance like that? Move. How much more are you going to disappoint me? I'm fine with you not liking me. You don't want me as your pupil? That's understandable since I talked back to you. That's why I was planning on watching from afar. But I can't do that anymore! Are you sure you won't regret doing the inauguration performance? No, I'm not. - Then why-- - I was told to do it! I'm supposed to be bloody instead of elegant! Do you think this was an easy decision for me? I'm contemplating whether or not to do it 100 times a day. Then don't do it! Why do something you don't want to do? You're young. "Congratulatory performance given by Mr. Kang." He's really performing! I don't know about anything else, but I thought Maestro Kang was great for being unwavering and uncompromising. - My gosh. - That's not all. He's talented as well. He has sentiment, but it's just that he doesn't say things nicely. He has humor. He's funny. So Maestro Kang has talent, humor, sentiment, and is unwavering and uncompromising, of which I valued his uncompromising nature. But if he does this, he's a traitor. A sell-out! Fine, let's show him what's up. - Here. - How? - Congratulations on winning. - Thank you. - Oh my gosh, congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations! - Thank you for coming. This will be a grandiose inauguration. But I'm a bit confused why you need to use the orchestra, formed by taxpayer money, to play at your inauguration. I'm quite confused, actually. - Mr. Kim. - You made it. Of course I should come. This used to be my turf. I was a bit surprised when you were so willing to take my offer. I see. But I wonder if there's a seat for the ex-mayor. - Usher him. - Well... - Thanks for all your hard work until now. - No need to thank me. - You know how I feel, right? - How would I know? I don't. - I don't know how to console you-- - You don't have to console me. - It's okay. I got it. - Okay. - Thanks for all your hard work. - Stop it. - I'll come visit you soon. - Forget it. Don't come. The maestro is getting everything ready, right? Oh, yes. - Mayor Choi, congratulations! - Of course. Thanks for coming. What time is it? Did he hand out the sheet music yet? No, not yet. - You didn't eat? - No. What time is it? What is he trying to do? The preparations are coming along, right? You'll begin in 30 minutes! - Mr. Kim! - Yes? We don't even have the sheet music. What? You don't have the sheet music? Maestro Kang. I mean, where's Mr. Kang? Why are you asking me? I'm going nuts. Where in the world is he? - My goodness. - I'm going nuts. What is he planning on doing? Aren't you ashamed? So you want me to fight knowing I'm going to lose? You want to see me ruin my reputation and get fired nonetheless? No. I don't want to see that. However, more than anything, I don't want to see you run away lying. Mr. Kang Gun-woo, you have a delivery. RUNNING AWAY? {\an8}MAESTRO KANG IS THE BOMB You better not bend after shaking hands with Mayor Choi. If you do, I'm going to bite your hand. Mr. Kang, you're the bomb. Please make sure we can keep saying that. Did you know I was the school bully back in the day? You better not bow down to the mayor, or else I'll show you how scary young kids are these days. Mozart's best friend, Ha I-deun. I'm not in a good mood lately. Want me to barge in after having a few drinks again? Your big sister. Once you submit to Mayor Choi, I'm going to refuse to treat Thoven. Whatever decision you make, I have faith in you. Mr. Kang, I heard you didn't hand out the sheet music yet. What are you thinking? Here's the sheet music. Hand them out. Oh, the sheet music. Will do. Come out soon. These are the sheet music. Must I hand these out to you? We don't have time. Review it quickly! Look carefully. Look quickly. My fellow Seokran citizens. Let me tell you once again. I will... Aren't those music stands behind Mayor Choi? Orchestra music stands? Mayor Choi's standing right in front of the camera. I'll take responsibility for my actions. Let's go hand and hand into the bright future of Seokran! Let's create a Seokran Philharmonic! INAUGURATION CEREMONY MAYOR CHOI SEOK-GYUN Next is the Seokran Philharmonic congratulatory performance lead by Maestro Kang Gun-woo. He's really going to do it. What is he going to perform before playing "My Way"? It's "4'33" composed by John Cage. I've never heard of it. It's a three-movement composition. It's supposed to be a very philosophical score. Philosophy? That's good. You're so ignorant. Do you think anyone can be a mayor? He's really going to perform. What? What? - Mr. Kang. - Hush! You may speak. The first movement just ended. Pardon? This score John Cage composed is based on the modern music theory of contingency. During the silence lasting four minutes and thirty-three seconds, you need to feel how all the sounds heard in the concert hall becomes music to me. That goes for you too! Cough? Just do it. If the paper falls, pick it up. If your phone rings, answer it. Music is all around you. Enjoy it! Enjoy it! Didn't he say music is around you? - Don't wait for a call. Make a call. - What are you doing? - What are you waiting for? Just do it! - What are you doing? Make a call. What did you feel while I was performing the first movement? Anger? Greed? Or a sense of selfishness for survival? Just accept it. That's exactly your music and your instinct. Should I perform "My Way" like this too? I'll start the second movement! Aren't you going to perform? The second movement, everyone! It's fantastic! He chose the perfect piece. I can't believe there's a score like this. We're making music. - The second movement. - It's the second movement. We're making music. Aren't we making music? Mayor Choi, make music. You should make noise. He has his reasons. I knew he would do this! Great! Hey, animal hospital! Your treat! - Maestro Kang is the bomb! - The food is on me! - I'll buy everyone drinks! - Yes! - Order whatever you want. - Nice. That was great! I might regret my decision for making you stay when I see you get hurt. But... I want you to be true to yourself. So you want me to fight knowing I'm going to lose? You want to see me ruin my reputation and get fired nonetheless? How can a conductor be 30 minutes late? Did you watch Mr. Kang's performance? He made me a fool for worrying about him. Does he like being cool by himself? Why didn't he tell me? I even went to go persuade him yesterday. Couldn't he have just told me what he was planning? What do you mean? I showed him my true colors, but he's hiding his. Did he say something to you? He said I was young. You are young! I was traumatized when I first heard that, but after seeing him today, I think he was right. I wish I were getting older. You already are. Wait. Aunt, you need to play piano, not forte. Sorry. I want everyone to be careful of the subito piano. Be sure to play subito piano after the 65th bar sforzando-- Gun-woo, it's past one o'clock. Yong-gi, are you very mad? I'm really sorry about last time. It won't happen again. Well... If you suddenly apologize to me... then I'll have to accept it. It's okay. What should I do about the practice? I'll do whatever you say. - Should we go home? - You always ask me the tough questions. Everyone seems to be tired, so let's call it a day. But we're performing in two days. If we want to do our best... Okay, let's call it a day. Everything will be fine. Let's go. Wait. Hang on. If we want to do well, what? What are we lacking? If we go now, we'll have to give up from the piano part in bar 333. And the pesante part in bar 118. Oh, that's right. The Letter G part as well. Then will we fail? It'll be tough. Hey, agree with me. Gun-woo, how much longer will it take for us to master this? About an hour and a half? Oh, that's right. This part is a problem too. Hey. Then two hours. If that's not enough, three hours. Really? Absolutely. It's over for us if we don't get this. How much longer if we want to be safe? We have two days left, so we'll have to practice an hour before and after-- Just make it two hours. - We'll just die for two days. - Let's do it. It's our last chance. - Pull all-nighters! - Okay! Let's pull all-nighters! Thank you. Let's start with bar 80 with all our might. Let's do it! I saw her at the go club. What? You mean she plays go? Yes, I went to the dentist office in that building, and I saw her. She mans the counter. She's a bit older and limps, right? You're at home all day. Aren't you going to the go club today? Go. Don't you like going there? I'm not going. Of course. It'll be hard to meet at the go club, with everyone watching. Is that why you're waiting for me to leave so you can meet her at the park? Doesn't she man the counter and limp? Wow, what's this? Did you really rent a bus, Jun-gi? Yes, I asked my dad. It's a really important performance. We can't have accidents and damage our instruments like last time. We need to make things right this time. You must be rich, Jun-gi. No, my dad asked a friend of his to lend us a bus. Do you like the electric violin by any chance? I like it. This bus isn't anything. I even have a fire truck that my son now has. - What the heck? - Stop kidding around. We need to leave now to be on time for the performance. Who's not here yet? - Hui-yeon is not here. - She left a while ago. But where can Yong-gi be? He's going to stop by Mr. Kim Gap-yong's house with I-deun. His son came from Japan. Man. Is it them? - Are you Mr. Kim's-- - Yes. I'm really sorry. I was in Belgium as an exchange professor. I recorded my number incorrectly on my answering machine in Japan. You called several times, didn't you? - Forget about it. Let's go in. - Yes, but... The code isn't working, and he isn't answering the bell. Grandpa always changes it. Really? How do you know the code if he always changes it? He goes back one year in time when he changes it. He's in 1967 now. He's back 40 years. That's way back. Grandpa. Mr. Kim. Grandpa! Mr. Kim. - Did he leave? - Mr. Kim. Grandpa! Grandpa. I-deun, here... He must have been frustrated... when he couldn't play the oboe. I-deun. Grandpa. Mr. Kim. - Grandpa! - Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim Gap-yong, please show yourself! - Mr. Kim Gap-yong! - Grandpa! Grandpa! - Grandpa! - Mr. Kim Gap-yong. Grandpa! Mr. Kim! We're going to the police station. - Sure, go ahead. - Bye. - Grandpa! - Mr. Kim. - We can't look for him like this. - Where are you? - We need to use our heads. - Grandpa! He couldn't play the oboe correctly, so out of frustration-- Hey, answer your phone. I bet he wanted to play his oboe well. So... - Grandpa! - Okay. - Hello? - What are you doing? We're late! We have to leave now! We're in an emergency too. I-deun is a mess. We need to find Mr. Kim Gap-yong! - He's missing-- - The concert can wait! He left home because he was frustrated he couldn't play the oboe! Something might happen to him! We need to save him! I-deun. Hey, I-deun! Gosh! I met her a few times, but I broke up with her. Why did you like her? She was older and uglier than me. I heard she's an old lady who works at restaurants, cleaning and stuff. What did you see in her? After quitting my job, I yelled at you and the kids because of my ego. Honestly, I wanted to die, but she would listen... Why couldn't you tell me? You weren't even interested in me. Why wouldn't I be? You're my husband! How does that make any sense? Do you think I started the cello for only my sake? I wanted... I wanted you to look at me more! What did you say when I was young? Didn't you say I looked very pretty when I played the cello? But you never came to see me perform. The first time, you came to take me away. I wanted to talk to you too! I wanted to talk to you... The person you have reached... Why isn't my aunt answering? Did you hear? The Deliberation Committee was urgently called for your dismissal. Mayor Choi is very upset. He's been telling everyone you're getting the ax. Are you sure you don't want to go tomorrow? I'd prefer he fire me in one try. It's better that way, nice and clean. Did Gun-woo's group come? I was looking for them, but I couldn't find them. It's very odd. - When are they up? - They're the fourth to go. Only 40 minutes left. Let's go. Do you know how sad I was that you never came to see me perform? What? Oh my gosh, I'm crazy! I'm crazy! What should I do? The concert! - What? - Only 30 minutes left! Gosh! - Are you late? - Gosh. Art Center. What bus do I need to take, honey? What are you talking about? Come quick! I'll take you! Are you crazy? Why aren't you here? It's because not everyone... - What time is it? - Be calm. I asked Mr. Kim to place you guys last. You have an hour left. An hour isn't a lot of time. You'll be late even if you come now. We're the last to perform. We have an hour. We have to go now. Whom are you missing? I-deun, Yong-gi, and Hui-yeon, right? It's the flute, trumpet, and cello. We'll have our members on standby. He has city orchestra members on standby. You have to come now! The rest of you have to live! Can't we leave right now? Then I-deun, Hui-yeon, and Yong-gi will be cut. That company will only accept the members who performed on stage. We can't do anything about that. It's their problem-- Are you crazy? How can we abandon them at the last minute? - We'll be late even if we go now! - But still, that's not right. Hello? Hui-yeon, where are you? Gun-woo, what should we do? It's up to you. You're the conductor. No. Then what? You want to wait? What did I say you lack? Didn't I say it was determination? Become a bit tougher. What I want the most is to conduct people I'm comfortable with. You need to be meaner. That's the last advice I can give you. But music is... No, an orchestra brings happiness because you're together. I can't abandon them. We have to go together. Okay, do as you please. - Where did I-deun say she was? - Hui-yeon is on her way. - We're going to meet in the middle. - Let's get going. Let's go. Aunt, hurry up! Hurry! Give that to me. Get going. I'll be waiting at the concert hall. Thanks, honey. Gosh. What about I-deun and Yong-gi? They're looking for Mr. Kim Gap-yong. We're on our way there. Gun-woo, how much time do we have? We have 35 minutes. Mr. Kim Gap-yong. Go that way. Mr. Kim Gap-yong! Mr. Kim Gap-yong! Mr. Kim Gap-yong! He's not here, right? What should we do? Okay, go that way. Did you see an old man with white hair, glasses, and an instrument bag? No. An old man? Go upstairs. How much time do we have? About 25 minutes. They're going to bring everyone. Hurry, run! Run! - We made it. - Come on, hurry! - I thought you couldn't make it! - Why were you so late? - What about Mr. Kim? - His son took him home. - How much time do we have? - We have 15 minutes. - Oh dear. - Why is there so much traffic? Should we run for it? Faith moves heavens. - Sit down. - Have a seat. Are they crazy or something? How could they all not come because of three people? That's why he's Gun-woo. Our methods are different. He takes the longer, harsher route, but... That's his strength. - Why is there so much traffic? - Oh, no. - How do I read the time? - You have to look at it this way! - Gosh! - I'm going bonkers! - We may not make it. - Oh, no. Why are there so many cars when gas prices are so high? Let's get off. The Art Center is right here. Let's run for it. We don't have time! Hurry up and get off! Hurry up and run! Yong-gi, come quick! It's a short run! Hurry! - Hurry! - Let's hurry! Come out quick! Hurry! We don't have time! - Gun-woo! - Is everyone out? Gun-woo, come quickly! - Hurry! - Thanks. Hurry! Hurry! - Run! - Hurry! - Hurry up! - Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Let's go. The concert is about to end. Yes, I'm about to open the doors. Door! Open the door! Hurry up!
