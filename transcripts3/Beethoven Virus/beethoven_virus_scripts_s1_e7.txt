 Nice to meet you. Don't think that being in the city orchestra is a guaranteed job. If you do think that, please leave right now. Hello, sir. Why are you here? We're the backup performers. What do you mean, backup performers? I don't have to pay her. I only have to call her when she's needed, so no hassle. Not bad. Why were you so late?

 I'm sorry. Take your seat. - Look here, Ru-mi. - Yes. My place is here. I want to be together with these people. What? One idiot believed my joke, another idiot gave up everything to follow her. Anyhow, please go outside. Sorry? Didn't you say to stand all year long... Please leave! Gun-woo, we'll need to talk later. Well, I didn't know anyone there. - Oh, dear. - That's why you came to us? Did you run away from school when you were put into a new class?

 Did you go AWOL from the army because you didn't know anyone? Don't you get it? I came to seek revenge against you. Cruelly. You're going insane, but I'm starting to like you more. Come here. Seek revenge. - That hurts. - Seek revenge, man. Cruelly seek revenge. - We'll join you. - If you're done with greetings, here. Let go. - What's this? - Can't you tell? It's sheet music. - We need to practice. - Pardon? Practicing on the first day? Maestro Kang told us to stand by the wall. If he asks to see what you can do, will you say you just stood by the wall? Why do you want to join the city orchestra? It's because you want to perform. So, you should practice. Yes, we should practice. We may have scored poorly in our auditions, but with practice, we'll be as good as them someday. That will never happen. The worst student can't study for a few months and suddenly become the top of his class. The more reason not to practice. But if the kid gives up on everything else and only studies English, he can at least do well in that one subject. That's why I'm handing these out to you. This is Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9." It's a choral symphony. Ru-mi did a survey while planning for our concert, and this was the classical piece that people wanted to hear the most. It's likely that this will be chosen for the city orchestra concert. Why don't we focus on this? We'll be back to square one if this isn't selected, but Maestro Kang will have to... May I get one, too? I want to practice with you. Did you tell Maestro Kang you're joining us? He seemed completely out of the loop. No, not yet. Forget about practice. You need to apologize to him first. Excuse me. Why did you come? You texted me. Stop playing games. Why did you join the backup members? Just because. Why? Are you ashamed to say it? Want me to tell you instead? Maestro Kang chose you as an orchestra member, but you're scared of the other talented people and don't feel like practicing hard, so you wanted to run away. But there were unintimidating people near you, so you decided to be with them so you could stand out. Isn't that why you came? What? Don't book anything for Saturday afternoons. I have to perform at Don't Tell Papa on Saturdays. This is top secret. If Maestro Kang finds out, he will either not choose this piece or give us the ax, saying that we cheated. Yes. Sorry? Did you see Gun-woo? Oh, yes. He went that way. Don't scold him too much. He's still young. Why would I scold him? It's my index finger's fault. My index finger called him to try and audition. I want to cut it off. I really don't understand what's going on. Why are you doing this to me? If you want an explanation, fine. After the concert, Maestro Kang asked me what my definition of happiness was and to act on it accordingly. What I want the most is to conduct people I'm comfortable with. That's why I joined you. Is that wrong? So, you're saying you like to goof off. Hey! Think about it. With your skills, if you got into the city orchestra, you should aim higher, not lower! Aim higher for what? What I want is to conduct, not become a city orchestra member! I wanted to be a backup member so I could study, go to college, and learn how to conduct! Why are you so angry about that? Angry? No, I was so proud of you at first. We didn't make it, but you did. I was envious. I was a bit jealous. But I thought I should sincerely congratulate you because you're a good person. But now, as you said, I'm angry. Don't you have any desires? Don't you want to improve? What does it mean to improve? To become successful and famous? Is that so important to you? Actually, you're not a good person. You're a fool. What? Good. Enough. Ru-mi said something right for once. You're smart. I'm impressed. We're in the middle of a conversation. Didn't you agree to be a backup member? The orchestra members are practicing. Aren't you going to observe? Where are you going? I need to observe, too. I'm a backup member. Oh, that's right. Then you must remember this as well. I can fire backup members whenever I want. Get out. I don't care if you're a backup member. Just get out of here. - I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but-- - Do you know why I accepted you? Is it because you're exceptional? No, it's because you have a ways to go. I wanted you to get the urge to do better, to have your pride trampled upon, so you could transform. How could you run away from that? I'm not running away. Really? Then what are you doing? Are you doing this out of sentiment or loyalty? Sure, I think you're mature enough to not care about those things. But... Ru-mi mentioned something very good. Desire. You're only associating it with success and fame, but real desire is different. How much aspiration is burning inside of you? Another word for desire is power. The power to prevail, no matter how hard it is or what stands in your way. Desperation. That's one thing you lack. Don't make any assumptions. How could I quit being a police officer if I didn't have that? You probably wanted to have fun. Didn't you say your definition of happiness was conducting those losers? You think you're always right. But everyone has their own unique style. Of course, there are desperate people among the hotshots. But there are people who do better when they enjoy what they're doing. - I'm-- - Look here. Do you think I'm here to discuss things with you? Regardless of what kind of member you are, I'm your boss. I fired you because of your bad attitude. What more reason do you need? I'll show you. Desperation? Determination? Desire? It's not that I lack them. If you want, I'll show it to you by using your exact approach. Go ahead. Gun-woo isn't here yet. Is he still talking to Maestro Kang? He needs to get scolded. He has no discipline. Hey, Hyeok-gwon! Hyeok-gwon, you auditioned? How did you get in? You're about as good as I am. Let's talk about it later. Sorry, let's keep practicing. Seeing as you got in, I was insecure for nothing. - I guess anyone can get in... - Do you know them? Yes, we were former orchestra colleagues. The concert went well, but they were cut. - They're a bit bitter. - Oh, I see. Concertmaster, shouldn't you say something? Let them be. They must be uncomfortable, too. Have a seat. Sit down. Oh, no. Whose instrument is this? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Shouldn't you accept my apology... I'm sorry. Look here! Do you know how much that instrument costs? All musicians' instruments are expensive. Judging from the discoloration and stuff, it doesn't look that expensive. It's an 1890 Stradivarius violin! "Stradivarius"? It's expensive. It costs more than 100 million won. I'm sorry. He didn't know, but he's not a bad person. If you could be understanding... Forget it. Please leave. It's really crowded in here and you're creating tension. How absurd. We're members, too. We're backup members. Mr. Kang told us to come! Oh, Mr. Kang said that? He told you to cause a commotion, interfere with practice, and break instruments? He didn't say that, but what do you mean by "break instruments"? I think you're being too harsh. Mr. Kwon, can you take a look at that instrument? Is there a scratch? It's okay. Take a better look. How could it be okay when he hit it? I can't believe you. Do you want to fight? Jung-jin, stop it. We have to voice our opinions! Even if you have Mr. Kang's permission to observe, you shouldn't have come. But I'm being lenient because I know you have an inferiority complex - from being cut after your concert. - What? An inferiority complex? Yes, I'm sorry. It's true. We're bitter. So please, let us at least observe. Please. Why did you apologize? You were the concertmaster. Shouldn't you know better? We aren't wanted here. I'm being patient because an elder spoke, but please be quiet. We're musicians. We're very sensitive. Concertmaster. Okay. "We're musicians"? So then, are we artists or athletes? Are we linguists or mathematicians? Have a seat. Let's match their level. Sit. Sit down. Sir, have a seat. Let's sit. Our skill level is about the same. I'm going to sit. Sit down. I'm going to sit. I was fired. I'm going to get some fresh air and clear my head. Mr. Kang, did you fire Gun-woo? Don't you need to evaluate regular members before firing them? - How can you fire him on the first-- - Isn't he a backup member? That's odd. I thought you and I were on the same side when I saw you fighting with him. I said those things for his own good. I was mean to him because he doesn't know how talented he is. But you literally gave him the boot. He'll ruin the entire orchestra. Gun-woo is smart. He would've listened to you if you just scolded him-- Ru-mi, I think you shouldn't worry about him. Doctor's evaluation. Don't you remember? Okay, I think you must really be a blockhead if you thought I was being serious about the offer of being a backup member. It's not like you can't do music if you have a low IQ. Being deaf is much more serious. Doctor's evaluation. I don't have one. Then you need to leave since you're not normal. I don't have one because I am normal. How could I get one if I'm fine? Have you seen a doctor give an evaluation that says you're healthy? Is that so? I'll confirm with him. Go ahead. The doctor might be busy making rounds... Hello? Oh, hi, Dong-gil. It's me, Gun-woo. Didn't I refer a patient to you? Yes. She hears a ringing in the ear. How is she? It's serious. She wanted me to keep it a secret, so act like you don't know. She has acoustic neuroma. She had bad headaches. It's all because of the tumor. It would've been better if she came sooner. It's too late now. I can remove the tumor, but she'll still go deaf. I can't do anything about it. If she doesn't do anything about it, she'll probably hear for another four months. - Doesn't she do music? - Yes. I told her I would try to find a way to save her hearing. Check up on Oh Seung-won and prepare for our meeting. But I don't know right now. It will be difficult. I see. Okay, bye. Why are you so stupid? I didn't do it on purpose. You refused to pay his specialist fee! If you went to a specialist, you need to pay their fee. How could you make a scene over 13,000 won? My friend was embarrassed! I thought I didn't have to pay because you referred me to him. I paid him. I apologized later and paid for everything. Gosh, I was wondering what he was saying. Okay, you're dismissed. Okay, thank you. She refused to get surgery. She said that if she's going deaf anyway, she wants to play for an orchestra while she can still hear. She says she'll get surgery after she goes deaf. She's very brave and confident. I don't know if that's her personality or if she's just clueless. Wait, why did I go see him? Oh, Gun-woo. Gosh, I totally forgot because Maestro Kang is so manipulative. Brave? This isn't being brave. It's being foolish. So whatever rocks your boat, Ludwig van Ru-mi. What's his problem? Here's the money left over from the flute. Why is there so little? I bought a nice one, but it's a used one, and it's only nickel-silver. - And I bought a hat. - Jeez. I'll pay you back. I submitted the application for the gifted kids' contest. What? RECEIPT OF APPLICATION SUBMISSION I-deun, have you come around now? What about school? Would I be here if I went back to school? I'm going to take the GED. What's with your language? You need to be more respectful when you talk. "Eat. Please eat." Do you know what you put us through? You ratted us out to the mayor, so Maestro Kang... How much do you get as a backup member? One million won? Two? It's a non-paying job. Then why are you here? Are you crazy? You'll earn so much if you give private lessons! Can you be quiet? If you look at the big picture, this is a place for you to learn the basics. - Didn't you learn that in school? - Are they the pros? Sorry? I-deun. I must be right since you're saying lame things about art. Mister, you're being louder than we are. At least we're discussing one topic. You're all tuning your instruments in an unharmonious fashion. Do you say, "Art is beautiful," when you're tuning? May I ask what school you attend? - Hey, Jung-jin! - Which university do you attend? This is totally ridiculous. How can you be so ignorant and dated that you brag about your schooling? I just wanted to know how educated you are. I'm a high school graduate. She's a junior high graduate, no, a junior high dropout. Jung-jin, knock it off! Fine. You want to know how educated I am? I dropped out of Seokran Arts High School as a junior. My name is Ha I-deun. Mozart is my friend, and Beethoven is my apprentice. All the symphonies you're playing, I'm the one who composed them. I'm the Father of the Symphony. Satisfied? I-deun, go on. Keep going. You can tell how educated a person is by how they talk. You need to use honorifics when talking to adults! Do you think you're an adult only because you're old? There are lots of people over 30 who act like kids. Like you, kid. Look here! Be quiet! Just ignore them and practice! Shut up! Are we crap? Beggars? Don't look down on us, and bring it on! Why are you here? Hello, my name is Ha I-deun. Get out. Why did you bring her when you can't even control her? All of you get out! I'm so flustered and embarrassed. Oh, man! Why aren't you going in? When did you get here? I was thinking of visiting you when I had the time. This is great. How did you come here? Have you come around now? Why do people keep asking me that? I haven't yet. What about it? That's why I fought those people as soon as I came. So what? Be respectful to us. You fought them? I conversed in my own way. Is that why you got kicked out? Those people in there are really good. They're professionals. What's wrong with you? Be confident. We have something to perform, too. Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9 'Choral.'" Don't say anything. We can be like them if we practice. Can we pull it off? Man, we need Gun-woo at times like this. Gun-woo needs to show off his talent. Mr. Jung, your performance was fantastic. Thank you. - You'll be leaving for Vienna soon. - Yes. - When is your departure date? - Excuse me. I need to go to the men's room. - He's a world-renowned conductor, - That's right. but he's so down-to-earth. Seriously. That's rare. Are you Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan? Hello. My name is Kang Gun-woo. I was the first trumpet in last month's Seokran's Project Orchestra. Mr. Kang Gun-woo is my conductor. Or should I say, "was." - I guess he isn't anymore. - Seokran? Kang Gun-woo? What the... I'm here because I wanted to ask you what I should do to learn how to conduct. I wanted to know if I really needed to be driven by desperation or desire, and if enjoyment isn't possible. Please mentor me. I'll do my best. - I don't want to make any excuses, - He's so lame. but I was kicked out recently... You're so pathetic, Kang Gun-woo. What are you doing? This isn't like you. Why were you kicked out? Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan? Yes. You were in Kang Gun-woo's orchestra? I'm really close to him. You're at this level even though you've never taken lessons? You're gifted. I understand why you're being sarcastic, but-- No, I'm being sincere. I'm impressed. There are only a handful of people who have recorded an album by playing "Flight of the Bumblebee." But you played that. The most remarkable thing is, why did Gun-woo take you in as his pupil? He hates gifted musicians. Well, I wasn't exactly his pupil. I begged him to teach me. But he kicked you out? Why? Must I have desperation in order to do music? What? Can't I enjoy it? Isn't music supposed to be enjoyable? Well, Mozart did have fun. Have you heard of Allegri's "Miserere"? It's a beautiful song. But the Vatican said it was too beautiful. They hid the sheet music, so that it could only be heard in the cathedral. But some guy wrote down that song with nine melodies entirely from memory after hearing it once at the age of 14. Who? - Was it you-- - No, it was Mozart. I see. He was a true genius. Only someone like that can have fun while working. I'm just jealous, that's all. But I don't think Mozart would be goofing off while he was composing. What might Gun-woo think? Not you, but your teacher, Maestro Kang. I'm not sure-- Should we go ask him since I'm bored? Sorry? Aren't you here to be my pupil? Your former teacher is Kang Gun-woo. We need to get permission from him. I'll go and change. Sir! FRONT DOOR What brings you here? Didn't you have a concert today? I did. I'm a bit tired, but I'm here to brag about something. I got myself a pupil. Isn't that your hobby? Collecting pupils everywhere you go? Tell me something I don't know. This time it's a bit special. Hey, come in. Hey, come on in. So? You went to this punk after I kicked you out? Hey, what do you mean by that? You're so twisted. That's why you can't see what a precious gem he is, man. A gem? He's a stone. A commercial stone. He's got potential. You always say the opposite. - Do you have a dog? - No, because it's a hassle. - But I have some tropical fish. - Be careful. If you get on his bad side, he'll eat your tropical fish as sashimi. Really? What should I do? I'm thinking of teaching him if you're okay with it. What about you? Do you want to learn from me or from him? - I don't want him. - I wasn't asking you. I'm asking Gun-woo. What do you want? Do you want to come to me? Or do you want to go to him? I have no intention of staying where I'm not welcomed. Okay, let's do this. One week. Let's not make a hasty decision. There's only a week left before I leave, so you should... Just take him. It's a life-changing decision for him. Take him at once! Can you wait outside? What are you doing here? Nothing. I just couldn't fall asleep. When did you get back? Just now. You should've called. You saw me, so it's all good. What are you going to do from now on? I'll figure it out. I know someone who runs a music institute. Should I get a job for you? Why? Because you need to make money. Do I look like I can't take care of myself? I didn't become a backup member because I love to goof off. Why are you so judgmental? I was worried about you. Mind your own business! Are you my mom? Hey. Your mom? Moms would be a lot worse. If I were your mom, I would've beaten you when you quit the force. I would've forced coffee down your throat and made you practice. A backup member? I would've kicked you out of the house. Even your aunt told everyone to look for you. Your mom would've done a lot more. Fine. Should I treat you like a real mom? Should I beat you and force you to study conducting? Hey. I'm about to lose my hearing, but so what? I should mind my own business? I wish I had your problem. Good for you. Do you think Mozart was goofing off while he was composing? - How could he write music like that, then? - Exactly. It's the same for me. I worked my butt off so that you wouldn't surpass me. Minus one for not greeting the judges. Minus ten for not saying the right things. It was killing me when a guy losing points for stupid things kept beating me. But what was my image? I'm gifted, right? I needed to look at ease. A bloody nose? I had to suck in the blood if I got one. If I looked pale from fatigue, I had to hide it with makeup. Why? Because I'm gifted. Because you would freak out if you knew that I worked so hard. You would catch me. And then it would be over for me. Are you consoling me? He reminds me of you more than he reminds me of myself. He's very stubborn, and he runs full speed ahead once he sets his mind on something. That's why I like him. If he comes back to me after a week, I'm going to accept him as my pupil. That's for sure. What's this? I'm so honored. I don't know what to do. Do you suddenly feel bad about leaving? Do you have a sense of shame now? Fine, I'll let you give me the red carpet treatment until you leave. Change the music. To a CD. You're scaring me. What are you planning to do to me that you're being so docile? I contemplated all night last night. So... If you would allow me to, I would like to stay. I would be screwing over Myeong-hwan. You can't do that to my friend. Of course, I'll apologize to him politely. You want your connection to Myeong-hwan, but you don't want to lose me. You two-timer. Are you already thinking about debuting? Are you trying to build your network in the music industry? I can't do anything about it if you don't accept me, but that's how I feel. I would like to stay. Is that so? Then serve me with everything you've got until he leaves. Tissue. - I've memorized the song now. - Hi, Mom. How is everything? - I'm okay. - Oh, I have a headache. - Okay, I'll call you soon. - I'm so sore. Okay. Bye. Come to my office. What took you so long? Pardon? Put the morning paper and an espresso on my desk every morning. What? What's wrong? You can't hear? {\an8}That's a big problem. When did that start? {\an8}This morning? Or right now? Didn't I say I could hear? Stop making fun of me. {\an8}You really can't hear? I'm talking in a very loud voice right now. {\an8}Oh, dear. Should I call an ambulance? I can hear the music over there. Really? Then tell me what I said when you first came in. You only moved your mouth. How would I know? Didn't you look at my mouth? You should've learned how to read lips. That's how you can go about your life even if you go deaf. You said something about the paper and the desk. You missed the espresso. Put the morning paper and an espresso on my desk every morning. Why should I? I gave you a chance as a backup member. You need to do your part. Ru-mi, do you like me? Sorry? You've become more annoying. I just want to make it clear. Stop having feelings for me. That's not love. It's adoration for a person who has something. Envy of the ease and experience. It's called the Electra Complex. In other words, it's not love, but in psychological terms... You're mistaken. Then what is it? Is it because you're cornered? I knew someone who was terminal. He wasn't dying. It was his hearing. He was going to go deaf in six months. You remind me of him. I told you I'm fine. He didn't want to be immature and cry, since it was inevitable. So he tried hard. But it was ridiculous. He was giving off strange energy and determination, and... How should I say it? He was emotionally excessive? Overreacting? That's right, he was overreacting. In other words, abnormal. Just like you. I'll get going. I was yapping too much, right? I wanted to give you this. It's candy. I heard it's good for your hearing if you melt it in your mouth. I'm giving it to you because I made fun of you. My hand is about to fall off. Thank you. You'll have to be careful. It expired two years ago. I can't believe the nerve... This is bubble gum! It's the 100-won gum they sell at local stores. How can I melt this in my mouth? Sincerity moves the heavens. Who knows if the gum will melt and if your ears will heal in 1,000 years? STRUCTURE OF THE EAR I went to five different stores, but none of them have the wine you want. I looked closely. Yes, I even asked around and looked it up online. He's making me run around all day long. No, I was listening. Yes. - Be sure to buy the wine. - Yes. You know the book about the history of music? Did you take it? Why did you take my book without asking me? Where is it? In your room? Come back this minute and put it back! Didn't you want me to buy the wine? Please make me do one thing at a time! Get the wine first. Weren't you going to serve me until you left? Why are you so impatient? Do your best until the end. It's a pigsty in here. How could he live like this? Allegri's "Miserere"? I couldn't buy the wine, but I ordered it from a specialty store. I can pick it up in the morning... What's this? Did you copy it or was it a dictation? - What's dictation? - Writing it down by ear. Did you try to do it like Mozart? I tried, but it was hard. I couldn't write down the last few measures. How many times did you listen to it? Once. I heard Mozart did that, too. What's this? - Do, so. - As a chord! It's a C5. Didn't you learn in high school? How many times did I tell you? I slept through music class. Come here. What's this? - Do, mi. - As a chord! Don't you know 1, 4, 5, 8 is a cadence and 2, 3, 6, 7 is a major? What's this? Do, fa sharp. What are you doing? Give me a chord! Ti, do, re, mi flat, fa sharp, la flat! Yes, I don't know the chords. I'm a moron. Satisfied? I can't believe he wasted his talent all this time. That dumbass. Sir, someone is here. What? - How have you been? - What brings you here, sir? He told me to come. What choice do I have but to come? He has a bad temper. Come in. What is it? You said it was about him. I'll call you when I arrive. What are you doing? Your teacher officially gave me permission. Sorry? He told me to take you. You're okay with it, right? I won't see you out. I don't expect you to. You don't have to see me off either. I'm going to look into your school, so let's talk at the airport. - Bye. - Bye. You got your wish. Be sure to make the right connections. Wow, what timing. Hello? Hello? Mom. Gun-woo? Oh, yes, my son. Where are you calling me from? I don't recognize the number. A pay phone. I was pretty harsh last time. So? Did you think I wouldn't take your call? Hello? I knew it was you the moment my phone rang. It's useless even if you run miles away. Really? Then I guess we can be apart. "Apart"? Are you going somewhere? Maestro Kang did that? His ego must have been hurt. He was happy to get rid of me. But still... When are you leaving? Tomorrow? Yes. I'm going to see Mr. Jung off and go to Busan. My hometown. It's easier to study at home. I'm going to look into test prep classes and Mr. Jung will look into helping me prepare for the practical test at a local college. I see. I'm going to pack lightly. Besides, if I get into a college... Hang on, it will only be for a few months, right? If I don't get in and apply next year, I'll be 26. Wow, it gives me goosebumps. At least you're going down the right path. I wanted to kick you in the butt when you said you would become a backup member. But I'm sad and I want to tell you to stay now that you're moving forward. Why am I such a hypocrite? Me too. I don't want to leave. I know you don't mean it, but thanks. My hands are all clammy. My hands are crying for me. They don't want you to go. I remember the first time I met you. You were a total jerk. Do you know this is all thanks to me? Absolutely. I can foresee the future. I knew it the moment I saw you. "He'll do well. He'll be famous. I should befriend him." Foresee the future? Foresee the future. Then guess what's going to happen in a minute. What? In a minute? Let's see. What is it? What could it be? A lunar eclipse? What is it? Do I find money? Or... What is it? What could it be? So... A kiss! You're not supposed to guess it right. I know. Let's do it again. What? Starting from foreseeing the future. I won't get it right this time. Bite them! They're guilty of PDA. The deaf and the idiot. It's a stupid couple. Carry on. Weren't you trying to show off your love in public? You want to boast how close you are and how passionate you are for each other? - Go on, I'll clap for you. - It's not what you think. We're not passionately... So... It just happened... What is it, then? You leaped before you looked? I'm the one who initiated it. It was mutual because he's a good guy. It's dark and the mood... They're never going to do it in front of us, right? They want to be left alone to continue. We'll have to get out of their way. Let's go. You must have been surprised. But weren't we going out? I thought we were. What? Going out? So I didn't mean the "passionately" part. Not passionately, right? I'll go clean out my locker. Wait here. Okay. I burned a CD of our performance. Do you want it? Yes. Just follow my lead and you'll be fine. Let's see. Do laundry, clean the floors and the sofa, do the dishes, and make breakfast. Did I do everything? Sir, I'm leaving. Be sure to eat. If you feel lazy, order in. It may have MSG, but it's better than nothing. Stop taking sleeping pills. They're bad for you. Your body will develop a tolerance. If you can't sleep, drink warm milk and take a bath instead. Okay? What's the use? I'm leaving. Be quiet. I told you to be quiet. Be quiet! Thoven, why don't you listen to me? You bastard. The roads will have heavy traffic because it's the weekend. It will take at least six hours to get to Busan, so eat these on the way. Let's go. Thoven, should we take a long walk today? How about we go to Lake Park? Do you like that? Okay, let's go. Hello? It's me, Dong-jin. It's about Du Ru-mi. Yes. I tried to find a way to save her hearing. But... Did you see Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan? No, not yet. Did you make sure Maestro Kang had breakfast? I don't know. He texted me, saying that he's at a park. He went for a walk and he wants me to pick him up because his legs hurt. As if his legs really hurt. I saw him walk around several times yesterday. Be nice to him for me. I guess I worry about him because he's the same age as my older brother. Third floor. Thank you. Ru-mi, let me call you later. Why are you nervous? He's just Maestro Kang. He's not a guy. Mr. Kang! I'm here! Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang? He didn't say much. He must have been embarrassed. Actually, it's the first time I've ever heard him say that. Sorry? Well... Anyway, so you... Are you going to Busan from here? You have your stuff with you already. What did Mr. Kang say? Was it about me? Well... He told me not to tell you. Do you know what the first thing he said to me that night was? Gun-woo is a musical genius. You don't sound sarcastic. I don't want to acknowledge it, but it's true. He's a crazy bastard. Didn't you say there's no such thing? Not the geniuses normal people think about, but my definition of genius. He's not like you who wants to be successful and famous with a small gift. He's a real musical genius. He's gifted and courageous. Mozart is his rival. He copied "Miserere." He has no mold or form. His emits so much energy, it's blinding. And on top of that, he's warm and caring. The scary thing is, that's only the beginning. It's just the tip of the iceberg. I can't imagine what's hiding underneath. Why are you giving him to me? Does he have a weakness? That weakness is me. As you know, I don't have any connections, alliances, or apprentices. I can't get him into a university or get him a sponsor. I'm not someone to suck up to. I can live my life like this, but I can't force him to follow my path. These days, I still wonder if I've made the right choice. He needs someone to lead him. But not a person like me who's biased, egotistical, and stubborn. They'll ruin him. If he hangs around me, he's going to become like me. An outsider conductor. Eternally an A minor. He's too talented for that to happen. He's just realizing his talent, so it's late. Make him fly quickly to make up for it. Please. Do you know who my rival is? It's your mentor, Kang Gun-woo. But he could care less about me. He's that brilliant. Didn't you see how I always followed him around? But that Gun-woo asked me for a favor. He didn't even blink when he was about to get kicked out of school for not paying tuition. He thinks all the conductors in the world are beneath him. This is the first time I've ever heard him ask me for a favor. So you need to give it everything you've got! - Mr. Jung, you need to go. - Yes. Okay. Let's go. Let's talk on the way. Sir, I'm here. Mr. Kang. Didn't you hear me? Is something wrong with your hearing? Excuse me, sir? Yes, thanks for coming. It's not that... I'm sorry, but I think-- Yes, go to Gun-woo. I would be pissed if you didn't go to him after what I've told you. You made the right decision, as expected of Gun-woo's pupil. I'm sorry. Honestly, I have way too many pupils. I have more than I can handle. Didn't Gun-woo tell you? That I have pupils all over the world? Bye. Stop! Wait! Stop the bus! Stop! There's no solution for your hearing. He looked into it, but there's no way. It will get ruined. How did you know? The doctor is my friend. Did you think you could keep it from me? Yes, I knew I wouldn't be able to hear. What? Are you saying it's no big deal? I went to see other doctors just in case he was wrong, but everyone said I wouldn't be able to hear. Are you stupid? Do you lack imagination? Do you know what it means to be deaf? People next to you will be mute. You can't converse! You can't hear the birds in the mountains and can't hear the waves in the sea. You can't hear thunder and cars will ram into you! Most of all, music will disappear! Your violin! What? Is your heart suddenly racing? Have you finally realized the gravity of the situation? I know. I have... I've been thinking about it. I misjudged you. You're really stupid. You're dumber than I imagined. I wanted to give you advice because you looked cute bouncing around, but forget it. Acoustic neuroma? It's the perfect illness for you! Hey, stop right there! Who are you to lecture me? Do you think I'm happy because I'm always smiling? What did you learn all these years? Don't you know how to look past the curtain and into people's hearts? Curtain? You have no curtain. You're transparent. You're very simple-minded. Oh, you can talk. "I'm such an amazing woman. This kind of setback? I can win over it." You don't even know what a real setback is, yet you act cool as if you've overcome it. You're tacky, simple-minded, and vain to think you're an amazing woman. It didn't hit me yet, that's all. You were in denial. I didn't know what to do. I really didn't know what to do. Is that so? Then I'll tell you. Jump in. Do you see the lake? Isn't it blue? It's very deep, and there's no end to it. On top of that, it's murky. You can't hear anything. You'll probably want to die. No, you might die. No one is going to help you, and you'll just have to die. That's despair, tribulation, and reality. You need to go through all that in order to face your illness. Isn't it perfect? Why don't you jump in? See? You're all talk. Fine, I'll do it. Hey! Ru-mi! Hey, Ru-mi! That's why I can't perform the "Choral." Test them to see how good they are. I'll believe in your potential. Let's try it. May I call you Gun-woo? Why, you... What are you doing? Did you not practice? Even Yong-jae O'Neill gets criticized. Did Mr. Kim miss a note? What's wrong with him? Mr. Kim Gap-yong. You don't need to come anymore starting tomorrow. There was a car accident. - An accident? - I... don't have dementia. Grandpa! I can at least fight. Who plays classical music at a bar? It's a complete buzz kill! I conduct classical music that kills your buzz. Where did you go? I was looking for you. Where the heck were you... I... I couldn't breathe.
