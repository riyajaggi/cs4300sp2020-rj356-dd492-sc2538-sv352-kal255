 They're going to report you and Ru-mi for forging official documents. Don't you dare do anything to Ru-mi or any of my orchestra members. The moment you do, I'll expose you. I just got fired. Did we just get fired? Gather people together and enter that. So if the orchestra members receive a good evaluation... Please accept them as official orchestra members. You handle the people. You can do it, right? I want to make the decision. I'll be the one conducting.

 {\an8}Get rid of your ridiculous interpretation. {\an8}Purge it out and go with what I wrote down for you. I can't do that. Did you want to be cool that badly? {\an8}Did you want to compensate for being dumped by acting cool? {\an8}You didn't want to be a crybaby because of love, {\an8}so you pretended to act cool, but it was killing your ego, and you wanted to be compensated. Mr. Kang. Didn't you purposely want to force a difference so you can spite me and prevail? I've been very patient. Who told you to be patient? Just let it out! Get rid of the notion that you need to be nice and cool!

 How can you do music when you're bottled up? Do whatever your instinct tells you to do! Just let your determination, desperation, anger, and frustration out! Sure. I'll fight you. Don't come here ever again. Don't interfere with what I do. You don't want to participate in the orchestra festival? It's my orchestra. You can't do it alone. I'm the conductor! Hello, ma'am. Thanks for coming. Come on in. Sorry to have ruined the mood. Mr. Kang and I just have our differences. Things would've been different if I was in charge of only practice, but this time, I'm conducting you myself. Starting now, I would like to do it my way. Is that okay? It's okay. Do whatever you want. You're the conductor. Yes, do as you please. That's right. You need to be strong for us to be strong. Good luck. Then, I want to change the score. Is Tchaikovsky's "Piano Concerto No.1" okay? Thank you. It will be difficult since it's our first time, but let's try it. I'm going to visit Grandpa really quick. Didn't you stop by in the morning? What is it? Is he not well? He's still sick, so I want to make lunch for him. You still couldn't get a hold of his children in Japan? One went to Europe as an exchange professor, but he was speaking in a foreign language, so I have no clue. I'll be back soon. You know we have a recording in the evening, right? - Yes. - Yes. This is our last practice before the recording, - so you need to do your best. - Okay. Let's reconvene in an hour. - Okay. - Sounds good. Ju-yeon, shouldn't the violins practice together instead of on your own? It's because Ru-mi is not here... Just how much later will she be coming? If she won't practice hard, she shouldn't bother coming. Ru-mi is always the first one to come and clean the place. This is her first time being late. I slept so well. Look at the time! This piece of crap didn't even ring. What's wrong with this? Is it broken, too? Was there a power outage? First flute, what do you think I'm going to say about your performance? My pitch is different from the piano... Only the piano? What do you think? You know I'm not just talking about the first flute, right? Pardon? I'll do my best. If we can't figure it out on our own after practicing for five minutes, we should stay an additional two hours... Good! I'll give you three minutes. I stopped by on my way somewhere. May I see you for a minute? I'm busy. Why aren't you coming? Aren't you going to practice? She texted me back. She's meeting with her mom. That's odd. She said her mom was traveling a couple of days ago. Should I call her? Man, I got a call. Hang on. What's up? Oh, my. It's Bo-ra. Yes. Daddy is working. What? Where else? The city orchestra, of course. RU-MI Yes. Have you eaten? SWEET GUN-WOO Your phone is ringing. When are you coming? The violins can't practice because you're not here. Hey, are you listening to me? I'm with my mom right now. Didn't your mom go on a trip? - I haven't seen her in a while. - You're lying, aren't you? I'm going to be with her all day. I can't go to practice, - Hey. - so continue without me. Hey, what's wrong? Sorry, I'll be there early tomorrow. Du Ru-mi. - Du Ru-mi, please come in. - Hey, can you not hear? Hello? Ru-mi! Du Ru-mi. Come into the examination room. Examination? Hey, which hospital are you at? Hello? My mom is here. I have to go. Hey, Ru-mi! Hey! What? Is Ru-mi sick? Aren't we going to practice? I have to go make dinner for Grandpa. What's wrong with Ru-mi? It has started. It has affected both of your ears. The infection isn't as bad now, but I don't know if you'll hear. But even if you get better, you'll lose your hearing. I'm sorry. TINY RECITAL OF ANGELS God has an amazing talent There are so many beautiful things In this world But of them all I'm the best masterpiece Who made red apples and green leaves? There must be a talented artist Living up in the heavens How is your hearing? Do you want to beg on the street? Tell me what I just said. No. They can delay it with medication. I can hear now. I'm fine. Does Maestro Kang know? Yes. He looks out for me, but I don't want to depend on him. I don't want to be a burden. I've already caused him enough grief with Project Orchestra and the 300-million-won fiasco. I don't want to bother him anymore. I want to be an amazing woman to him. I won't be late for tomorrow's practice. I'll see you in the morning. Thoven's dinner! Don't rely heavily on being gifted. All you have is perfect pitch. Adding well doesn't make you a mathematician. Having good grammar doesn't make you a novelist. Water. Music is art. It needs depth. Fruit. Your insight, level, cultural background, and everything else will be exposed at the concert. What have you read other than martial arts magazines? What art do you know besides cartoons? Knife. If you keep doing whatever you feel like doing, you'll mess up the concert-- Please be good to Ru-mi. I really mean it. Did you even listen to what I said? I'll go this time. Annual dues? Okay. I'll be sure to pay this time. I can't believe you. Okay, fine. - Excuse me? - Yes? Yes, I'll pay my dues this time. I had requested to perform at the outdoor concert. I brought a recording of our music. Yes. Okay, I'll be sure to be there. {\an8}MOUSE PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA We went through a lot to record this. This is our last chance. - Can you please... - My goodness. I got it! I'm not asking for preferential treatment. All I'm asking you to do is to listen to it once. So, please... Would you please just listen to it? Okay. What? - Please listen to it. - Yes. Please. You came here because of a cold? Yes. I'm all better, but she insisted that I come. I heard the two of you are close. Yes, we met when I volunteered and gave free medical exams. Please check him thoroughly. How can he have a cold for a month? I'm all better now. I just have an itchy throat and a slight fever. I see. Let me give you a prescription. Where should you go with it? You're asking me to get medication. - Yes. - Then, naturally... The pharmacy. Oh, the pharmacy. I've become forgetful lately. I see. The price for your prescription is 1,500 won and you paid 2,000. How much change should you receive? I'll give the rest as a tip. So, how much? It's 500 won. I know! There's no need for a prescription. I'll get my own. Grandpa. Grandpa. What are you doing? How dare you try to deceive me? Grandpa, that's not it. You fooled me into coming here, saying it was for my cold. Did you want to prove that I had dementia? You said you had a good sleep this morning, right? But you weren't asleep. You were out and about. It wasn't just yesterday. It's been happening. You were out of it for a day, three days. And now, it's been a week since you got your memory back. Who's Yeong-ju? I know she's your daughter, but where is she? What does she do? There's no contact number, and she doesn't call you. It seems like you really miss her. What kind of daughter is she? - How could she not-- - She died. She died in a car accident when she was your age. I made her play the flute. She refused to participate in a contest, so I scolded her. She got into an accident that day... She played the flute? She entered contests, too? She wasn't able to compete. Is that why you wanted me to compete? You felt bad because you were mean to your daughter, so you became nice to me in her place? It's not that. I... Then why can't you remember me? If you really care for me, you should remember something about me. You lost your daughter more than 30 years ago. I followed you around like crazy. How could you forget all that? I don't expect anything big. Just my name. Isn't my name unique? You can find "Haydn" if you just open a music book. How could you... Where are you going? I'll get examined for dementia. I'm going to beat it. I'll remember you, Ha I-deun. Grandpa. You pick up medication at the pharmacy. You report a thief to the police and fire to the fire department. You know that, right? Wow! Ramen tastes best as is, without green onions or egg. Just the way it is. Didn't I tell you not to break the noodles? The noodles are short. You can eat longer that way. Everything tastes good here. Did the festival committee call you? They just told me to wait. That's what they said when I called this morning. Do you think we should've made our CD case more colorful? We should've covered it with gold foil. No, we need to be firm and dignified. We need to be calm and not panic. Don't panic. You need to be firm and dignified. Are you going to call them? I'm going to the restroom. Yes, you have to do what you have to do. You eat and do your business. Be dignified and firm. They'll call us if they need us. Is this the festival committee? I would like to speak to the person in charge of the outdoor performances. He's not at his desk. When can I talk to him? Yes, I want to talk to him about using the outdoor concert venue. He told me he'll call me back, but it's been over a week. Oh, the person in charge went to go get coffee. Call back later. But every time I call... I'm looking for the hearing aid you wanted. - Can you please wait until I find it? - Sure. Hello? Hello! Wow, I can't believe him. He's never at his desk. How can he get paid to work like that? Oh, man. Gosh, this concert is killing me. What the... There isn't even a scratch. Hey, you're so tough. You're just like Maestro Kang. Hello? Hi, Ju-yeon. I just called them, but... It doesn't seem like they care. I think they're ignoring them because they're a no-name orchestra. Excuse me, sir. Aren't you meeting with the committee members? If you were to put in a good word-- Why should I? He just learned how to walk, and now he insists on running the marathon without a coach! What more can I do but let him fall flat on his face? Is that so? Please throw away your trash. Oh, my. Mr. Kang, you're here early. The committee leader is in a meeting right now. I'll wait. Please wait in his office. I'll let him know you're there. Follow me. This way. Wait! I can't believe that lady. Right this way. - It's this room. - I see. - Goodbye. - Bye. What's wrong with you? Excuse me, sir? Are you out of your mind? Lady, please hang on. MOUSE PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA MOUSE PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Don't come here ever again. Don't interfere with what I do. It's my orchestra. I'm the conductor! Sir. I'm really sorry to have made you wait. I'm Cha Seong-hun. I'm the orchestra festival committee leader. - Okay. - Please sit. I'm Mr. Kim from City Hall. I should've paid you a visit first. Since you know you were impolite, let's cut to the chase. Sure. It's about your performances. From what I know, you released only one album. - I don't like studio recordings. - I know. We're preparing for a special to commemorate you, Maestro Kang Gun-woo. Do you have a copy of any live performances? You're referring to our discussion on the phone, right? I don't have a DVD, but I do have one on a CD. Yes. Thank you. I needed a variety of material, so that's great. Oh, it's good. A powerful strength can be felt. Your style has changed somewhat. Don't you stay true to the original piece because of your desire for precision? But the interpretation for this score is very fresh and new. Well, it's good. It's very good. When did you perform this? Oh, I took out the wrong CD. Some weirdos sent me a recording of their music to my house. - You can turn it off. - Okay. Wait a minute. But the performance is very good. Who are they? They're con artists. They lied on their resume to be in the Seokran Philharmonic. They're comprised of a high schooler, a cabaret performer, a senile man, and a housewife. - You mean... - Yes! I kicked them all out once I found out. I can't believe this is what they did in order to get back at me. You don't have to worry about them. - Okay. - Hang on. You mean to tell me those people can play this beautifully? Don't be enamored by their outer appearance. The piano cadenza is tolerable, but the rest is terrible. No, it's pretty unpolished. The pitch is unstable, and the technique isn't good. But there is something... They're completely different from standard orchestras. These days, professionals are perfect, but they lack soul. It's just like looking at a pretty doll. But with this, I feel a raw vitality. There's thought and passion. No, it's trash. Who's the conductor? A rookie who didn't even go to music school. He learned conducting for less than six months. But he could... He's a genius. He's trash! Wait! Why are you lagging behind? I know this part is supposed to be slow, but if you're this slow-- Hey, Gun-woo. Is your cell phone turned on? - Yes. - Is it fully charged? Yes. Let's not lag behind. Let's take it from the top. Yong-gi, put your phone down. Please focus on practice. They were supposed to give us an answer a week ago. We need to complain. That's right. I wonder what happened. Is the person in charge not at his desk again? I called earlier, but he won't pick up. See? They won't answer. They're purposely avoiding us, those bastards. Okay, let's finish this part. You keep looking at my cell phone. If you keep doing that, I'm going to turn it off. Okay, look at me. Gun-woo, your phone. It's them. Hello? Yes. Yes, this is he. - Yes. - Hey... Is it from the festival? Yes. I see. Yes. Yes. I understand. Yes. They said they're sorry... for contacting us so late... about our acceptance! We made it! - What? We made it? - Yes! - We can use the venue all we want! - We did it! Yes! We made it! See? I told you we can do it. You were impatient. We need to practice! Practice! We need to practice. Let's practice. - We have to drink tonight. - It's about time. Let's drink. - Let's drink until we drop tonight. - Let's test our limits. - Here comes the beer. - Let's aim to drink 20,000cc. Sounds great! Here. Hey. Tell us what they told you over the phone in detail, verbatim. - The conversation went like this. - Okay. Wait, I don't remember. - What the... - You'll remember if I hit you. Okay. They said it was good. Really? Are you sure they didn't just say that? I knew by the tone of the voice. The committee leader called me personally. The leader called himself? He could feel power in the performance. He liked it even though the recording sounded bad. He especially liked the score interpretation! - Really? - That's great. It's clear we're going to be the stars of the orchestra festival. That's right. The committee leader personally called us. Aren't we getting ahead of ourselves? Let's drink up. Drink. That's right. We'll be on the city's payroll soon! I don't care. I'm going to challenge myself to drink 20,000cc today. Gun-woo, have you made up with Mr. Kang? What for? We're playing a different piece entirely. Well, I still cook for him. Cooking for him doesn't solve the issue. He's still your teacher. It depends on the teacher. He's dating his... - Let's drink up. We have to drink. - Yes. - Hi, Mom. I didn't hear my phone ring. - Cheers. Hurry up. If not, Yong-gi will eat all the food. - Okay. - I'll eat it all. That tastes good. Hey. What? Yes, I got dumped. Do you want me to be a petty jerk after being dumped? Don't be. Those guys are such a turnoff. - That's right. - You're doing the right thing. You're the bomb. You're the bomb! The bomb! I don't know about that. Cheers! Cheers! We made it, Mr. Kang. But you didn't help us, right? You don't have any plans on making up with Gun-woo? Since you're older, can't you be the bigger man and... How is your hearing? It's okay. You do know you can't do music once you lose your hearing, right? Insisting on playing the violin when you're deaf is like trying to paint The Creation of Adam blind. It's a stubborn kind of selfishness. I can take care of myself. Everyone thinks they can take care of themselves these days. Tell me which way! Let's play poker. We'll play 10,000-won bets. Well, 10,000 won is too little. How about betting whatever you want? Sure. - When are you going to pay me back? - Once I get hired in the city orchestra. Who said I was going to accept you? Let's say classical music is blank. Fill in the blank for me. Are you interviewing me? Look it up in a book. Your answer is very different now. What do you mean? We met ten years ago, don't you remember? Why would I meet you? Do you think I have time on my hands? I went because of a school assignment. I said classical music is "blank," and asked you to fill in the blank. Do you know what you said? "I don't think it's blank." What are you trying to accuse me of? Do you think I'm some comedian? You really don't remember? Well, at the age of 40, you start forgetting things. I raise you 100,000 won. Call. Why did you change the score? It's still a piano concerto. Are you satisfied with the interpretation? Yes, to a certain extent. Do you know why Mozart was called a genius? Because he could write music out of thin air? No. Because he wasn't complacent and pushed himself further. He strove for excellence. - But you're-- - I said to a certain extent. I didn't say I was satisfied. It's my turn to bet. Do you have money? You accept goods, right? I just need to buy you the same one, right? Show your hand. Take it. I got lucky. I said take it! But you know, I always listen to your advice and take it to heart. I pretended not to because it hurt my pride, but I remember everything. I need to learn the basics. I need to know what the composer intended. I've kept them all in mind. You don't want to receive my help or my money. Take this at least. Why? You don't want it because I've used it since I debuted? I'll do my best. Don't be cocky. You're still in the palm of my hand. You're still too young. You're like a baby that just started to crawl. You really had nothing to do with us getting accepted, right? I said that you guys were trash. FESTIVAL What's that? They're performing over there, too. How can they perform in a rowdy place like this? Hey, stop complaining. Use your head when you do things. - I'll give you two stands to carry. - We don't have time. Hurry up. Don't slack off. I'm not slacking off! - Can't you see I'm working hard? - All right. - All right. Hurry it up. - All these instruments are rented. Hey. I'm holding it. How can you smile at a time like this? Get back to work. Hey. Min-ji, the side dishes are in the fridge, so set the table for your dad later. Hang the laundry for me, too. Why isn't she answering me? Honey, I'm off. I might be late. I have a concert today. Mom, I can't believe you! I told you to wash this for me by today! I can wash it for you after I come back. Besides, you have two more of these. I don't want to be jinxed. I get good grades in art when I wear this! I have to submit my artwork by tomorrow. It will be too late if you wash this tomorrow! If it's that important to you, why don't you wash it yourself? Why are you getting mad at me? You're really unbelievable. I'm going to be a senior soon. I have a concert today. I know, but you could have washed this for me yesterday. I came to rest after painting all day, and you tell me to set the table and hang the laundry! You talk as if I work you to death. Did I tell you to take care of the house? All I'm asking you to do is scoop the rice. You used to do everything! - I'm working now! - You got fired! I'm fine with you having a life and performing, but why must you do it now? You wouldn't let me turn on the TV when Jin-su was a senior. You treated him like a king. Why are you playing favorites? Oh, my gosh. Hey, Min-ji! Honey, the side dishes are over there, so make yourself-- It's so noisy. Turn it down! Make yourself some bibimbap later. Hey, Min-ji. Min-ji! - Daddy, me too. - Okay, after Mommy. Sweetie, where are you going? It's hard for you to move. I'm bringing Bo-ra with me. I'm going out with the moms from the nursery. You're due any day now. Where in the world are you going? I'm going to see you perform. Isn't there an orchestra festival today? Why didn't you tell me? Well... It's a small event. Don't come. I already bought the tickets. You didn't give me any tickets, so I bought these with my own money, including those for the other moms. Wave for me when you bow. Bo-ra! Come on, Mr. Kim. Let me sit next to the contrabassist. I'm only going to pretend to play. I won't make a sound. I won't ruin it. I want to do that for you, but Maestro Kang already set up the stage after the rehearsal. My wife is coming. She thinks I'm still in the city orchestra. - Where's Maestro Kang? - I don't know. Hey, what? You're here? Already? Why did you come so early? No, I'm not getting mad. The waiting room? Why did you go there? I see. No, I'll go. I'm in the restroom. I'll be right there! - Mr. Kim, I beg you. - Leave me out of this. - Where... - I don't know anything. Why isn't he coming? - Seriously. I guess he's changing. - It's mine. It's mine. Give it back. - My mom bought it for me. - It's my daddy's concert. Your dad got fired. He's unemployed. Mommy, what does "unemployed" mean? Getting fired from a company. Don't you watch the news? No, my daddy isn't unemployed! He didn't get fired! Daddy isn't unemployed. What are you saying? Didn't you say Bo-ra's dad got fired? Nam-ju! What does she mean by that? Well, so... I just heard about it... I heard it about two months ago. I heard he got fired two months ago. Two months ago? Yes. I just heard about it from someone, so I'm not positive. But that's what I heard. No, my daddy didn't get fired! Yes. It's true your daddy got fired. Are you Hyeok-gwon's wife? I'm Kang Gun-woo. I'm in charge of the Seokran Philharmonic. I see. Hyeok-gwon was fired two months ago. It happened because many things occurred at the time. You can say I fired him since I couldn't control the situation. Hyeok-gwon can't say it's unfair because he's not that talented. But yes, he's probably upset about being fired. Hyeok-gwon! He's going to perform today as well, at the outdoor venue with all the people who were fired. Their reinstatement will be determined by how well they perform. Hyeok-gwon isn't that exceptionally talented, but he's good enough to make it, so don't worry. What did you take me for? I'm more angry about you not telling me than you getting fired. Did I nag you? Am I that intimidating to you? No. It's because you're pregnant. I didn't want you to be stressed. Good grief. You look horrible. It must have been killing you inside. Mommy and Daddy, kiss? Kiss me, too. We need to kiss now? Do we? Must we? Why are those people performing? Didn't you say it's impossible? It was impossible, but Maestro Kang... Isn't that cheating? Why did he use his influence? That's cheating! That's true, but ultimately, the committee leader and the critics liked them-- The elections are soon approaching. What if people bring this up? People who don't know will criticize me for firing talented members like them. And the music world will slam me for hiring high school students and cabaret performers. Plus, these people are either too old or too young for the qualified age for civil servants. Who is it? Mayor Kang, where do we place the billboard promoting Seokran as a cultural city? - Just place it anywhere! - Okay. - Wait! - Sorry? - Did you say "billboard"? - Yes. - Come here for a second. - Come here. Sit, you're in the way. You want to remove Grandpa? Didn't you see him at the rehearsal? He's not in his right mind right now. And he made some mistakes during practice. Since he's such a logical person, it's too hard to lie to him. He keeps asking why the Seoul Philharmonic would perform at a place like this. I'll take care of it. Hey. I-deun. - How much is a skewer? - It's 1,000 won. I want spicy rice cakes, too. I'll get examined for dementia. I'm going to beat it. I'll remember you, Ha I-deun. - Mr. Kim. - What's this? Isn't this the Mouse Philharmonic? It's not the Seoul Philharmonic. It's a joint performance. But why don't I see my members? Where did they all go? It's odd. Ru-mi. Yeong-ju, I won't call you that because you said you're not Yeong-ju. But this is... I pulled a prank and you believed it? What? I did that because I was mad at you for scolding me, Dad. I'm Yeong-ju. Right? I knew it. Just like she said, we're doing a joint performance with Mouse Philharmonic. I'm here as a guest performer. I see. So let's go get them, Dad. I'll be right by your side. Oh, my sweetheart. My adorable daughter. I'll rock the show with my trumpet performance. - Good luck. - Okay. Gun-woo, Maestro Kang is performing. Let's go. I'll go as soon as I review this. Conductors are really different. Let's go first. - Okay, let's go. - Okay. I'm here to see Kang Gun-woo who will be conducting. Hey, Gun-woo. Mr. Kang Gun-woo highly recommended you. He's a sarcastic person. He seemed to be speaking ill of you, but I could tell he was rooting for you. Rooting for me? Yes, didn't you submit a recording in a CD? He personally brought it to my office and made me listen to it. You didn't know? Rumor has it, pianist Seo Hae-kyeong is performing with you upon Mr. Kang's recommendation. Pianist Seo Hae-kyeong? She's performing with you. You mean to tell me you didn't know you were performing with Seo Hae-kyeong? You can't do it alone. You need help from a soloist. I'm Seo Yeol. I run a local piano school. Get rid of your ridiculous interpretation. Purge it out and go with what I wrote down for you. You're still in the palm of my hand. You're like a baby that just started to crawl. Who is it? Don't you know how sensitive I am right before performances? Why did you help me? Was it for a sense of superiority as you watch us jump for joy, thinking we made it on our own? It was in the trash. What should I have done? Just leave it? It's true. I should've just left it there. But I have to provide for you. Hyeok-gwon is a whiny breadwinner. I-deun thinks she can get into college. And you always butt into other people's business. If I just let you be, you're going to blame me for ignoring you guys! I... used to think you cared for us. But now, I really don't know what your true intentions are. I really... What is your true identity? I'm the conductor whose meditation was ruined because of an intruder! Should I add something else? You have a cheap cabaret performer and a deaf orchestra member. I'm sick and tired of them. If I treat them badly, they should get the hint and give up. But they're stupid and thick-skinned. They have no pride, and they are ridiculously optimistic! They don't know if they're in front a cliff, and-- Were you like this to Ru-mi? Did you say that when Ru-mi completely lost her hearing? She can't hear? You didn't know? Does my knowing change anything? Even if I'm considerate to her, she's still deaf. She has to quit music. If she pursues music by relying on her optimism-- I'm starting to hate Ru-mi. I don't understand how she could like a person like you. She must be a masochist. Thank you, sir. For the first time, I want to beat you. Why didn't you come see Maestro Kang's performance? Sir, can you please say something? Let's go to the outdoor concert venue. But Rubinstein dismissed the concerto as trash. I would also like to show you, according to my instincts, what raw music is. He's better than Maestro Kang? What are you doing? If you have complaints, tell the mayor yourself. I'm going to quit. Is it because of me? How much longer will you kill my pride for you to be satisfied? My music has changed! It's getting destroyed!
