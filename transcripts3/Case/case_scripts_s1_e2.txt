 Why are you always here? I don't know. You have to do something about this. Well, I have to go. Lock up behind you. Come on. Let me know next time you're going to drink and pass out outside. Come. Take your shoes and jacket. Look at this. Jói recorded it last night. -It's Ragna. -I know.

 It's okay, I promise. Give me your hands. We need to be careful. The police are asking around about Lára. She had figured it out. -Did Lára tell them? -No. -Then there's her boyfriend. -Yes. That's nice. Cool. Have you chosen a special song? Yes, it's called Heavy Were My Steps. Isn't that right? Sorry. Sorry, can I call you in a bit? Have you seen the paper? -No. -You two are on the front page.

 Why? Take a look and then call me. Yes... Yes. Sure. Thank you. Goodbye. We're on the front page of Fréttavísir. Sorry. Isn't it enough? No. -They just lost their daughter. -She wasn't their daughter. Listen up. Let's take a look at our schedule for today. Did you see this? The parents don't look good. Why the hell didn't they tell us? That's the question. Isn't that the reason? She fell in front of a packed house a few days before. Let's finish the interrogations, talk to all the kids on the bus. Tóti, how's it going with the computer? We can't access everything, but the things we found were just normal teenage stuff. -Why can't we access it all? -It's all in a cloud. You need an American warrant to access it. -Did we get the phone data? -Yes. A lot of communication with her ex-boyfriend and then, one unregistered number. -I want to know who that is. -It's turned off. The kids use unregistered phones. I want to know who that is. Come on. Okay. -Hi, there. -What are you doing here? -Have the police talked to you? -No. What are you going to tell them? -What do you mean? -I know everything. Lára told me. -She hated you. -You believe what you want. All right. I know everything about you and Elfa Dögg and all the other schoolgirls. It would be best for both of us if you don't say a word. -Hello? -It's Gabríela. Yes, hello. I wanted to ask you about the information published in today's paper. Yes. What about it? Why didn't you tell me she fell during that performance? What difference does that make? Did you write those emails? Listen... I... It's the police... -Who is this? -Gabríela. If you want to talk to us, contact our lawyer. Thanks. Bye. Okay. Okay. She was your sister! Just take as much time as you need. I'll get Sigga to cover for you. Thank you. Hi. Can you talk to me, Elfa? I feel like you didn't tell me the whole truth last night. You had started sleeping with boys, right? -Elfa. -Yes. I mean... I did. Lára said she slept with Egill, but... But what? I sensed that it wasn't quite true. What was their relationship like? Just, you know... He adored her. Did she break up with him? How did he react? Badly. He was very sad. Was she going to meet him or someone else after the dance? No. How do you expect me to believe that you didn't notice she was gone? What were you doing? If you don't tell me, I'll have to ask everybody. -Do you want that? -No. I went home with a guy I'm dating. Okay. Then I sneaked home in the morning. Did Lára know? I expect you don't want your parents to find out that you're dating that guy. You know that if they find out I talked to you, I have to tell them. Shouldn't we just keep this meeting private? Thanks. I'm in front of the computer. What do I do? -Where are you? -At Guðný and Jónas' place. Okay. The accounts are on this computer. How am I going to get all his stuff? How do I copy this? Open a browser and write MayhemEU and then click FreeKevin. -What then? -Nothing. That's it. -Just get out of there. -Great. -Egill. -Morning. We're detectives. I'm Högni. Hi, Gabríela. We wanted to ask you a few questions about Lára Jónasdóttir. No problem. Her phone records show that you communicated quite a lot in the days before she died. What were you talking about? We were just going over a few things. Nothing serious. We had just broken up. And what did the text messages say? So you haven't seen them? Was something there you didn't want us to see? Nothing stopped us from talking. We were still friends. So you can't tell us anything helpful? No? Wasn't Lára a bit young for a guy like you? She was very mature. What do you mean? She had just started puberty. Why don't you date girls your own age? What has that got to do with anything? Our parents were all right with it. Where were you the night she died? I had strength training at Valur all night. -And they can confirm that? -Of course. Were you sleeping together? You know it's a crime to have sex with someone under the age of consent. I have nothing more to say. Thank you. -Shouldn't we... -What a creep. Take it easy with the judgments. -What? -It's Þór. I just saw the paper. Logi isn't finished. Oh? He's at Jónas' place. -That's the doctor? -Yes. -Is it serious? -I don't know, we'll find out. -Have you finished the update for me? -Yes. I'll drop by then and get it. -Hello. -Hello. -It's Mom. -Hi. Listen... Your sister is in a bad way. Can you visit her? I'm a bit busy. It's not a good time. She misses you. We both know that's not true. She does in her own way. -I'll look her up later today. -Thank you. -Okay. Bye. -Bye. They've always hated us. That wasn't going to change. -But how did they know? -Know what? The things I wrote to the dance teacher. Only we knew what it said. They must have hacked into your email. They have destroyed us. Look at this. "They pressured Lára all the time. "She had to do well in school, sports and ballet. "She was punished if she didn't." -Nobody takes notice... -Punished? Jónas, we're portrayed like we're monsters! Nobody pays attention to this paper. People should know what she was like when we took her in! They don't know what it's like to take in a child who has been abused and try to gain their trust! Shit. We gave her structure, and that was what she needed. Do you know if she was doing something illegal? No, not that I know of. Nothing strange the last few months? No. But... We didn't know her that well. She came, she danced, and she went back home. What can you tell me about the incident when she fell? Nothing, really. It can happen to anyone. But of course it's not fun to fall in front of 500 people, especially if you're only 14. You were rather negative about her parents in the paper. Yes, about that... A man came here and said he was the theater's lawyer. I'm sure he wasn't a lawyer. Reporters often behave like that. But was it true? What? A simple question. Is it true what you said in the paper? That her mother was obsessed? Jónas. -We have to do something. -What do you mean? I'm not allowing some trashy paper to say that I killed my daughter! I'm doing something about it. Hello, darling. Can you come over? No. There were a lot of kids there. I lost track. Did anything unusual happen? You knew Lára quite well. What can you tell me? Something that matters. Did you talk to Elfa Dögg? -They were best friends. -Yes. Why do you ask? -Did she talk about Mundi? -No, who is that? He's our classmate. Sigmundur. He's sick today. What can you tell me about him? Nothing. I just wondered if she mentioned him. -Rúna. -Nothing. Just... He's creepy. He's always showing the boys porn on his phone. He's a disgusting pervert. You have to talk to me. What do you know? A few weeks ago we all went to a party. And... -We were drinking. -Okay. -I fell asleep on the sofa. -What happened? Mundi came and dragged me into the bedroom. And... He... He started taking my clothes off. I couldn't move or do anything. Then Lára came and saved me. She dragged him off me and had him thrown out. And what happened then? He was very angry. She warned me about him. Later she told me he was a creep who abused girls. Those were her words? He abused girls? It works on PC and Mac. Great, thanks. Did you check on that Jónas? -Why do you ask? -No reason. Just general interest. I haven't gone through it all, but he's not an honest man. There's a lot of dirt there. I think it's best that we keep this a secret. We? General interest, my ass. Give me the information and I'll pay you. What are you going to do with it? Can't you see it? He's a doctor. Is it a problem? Thanks for coming. We have decided to report this to the police. -Report it? -All the information in the paper is taken from my personal emails. -Only I can access them. -You and the person they were sent to. There's a lot, they would have needed more than two days -to find all the emails. -What about Benedetto? He called us and said he was sorry. Some man visited him, said he was the theater's lawyer and got him to say all this stuff. We're going to sue them for libel. The paper? Yes, but mainly Soffía and Pálmi. Do you think that's wise? What would it look like? What difference does that make? They have destroyed our lives. -They lost a child too. -They lost a child 10 years ago. -It will make things worse. -So people can do what they like with private emails? Can people just do whatever they want? -It's ridiculous. -It's just more difficult than you think. Don't you want to come in? No, I have to go. Will she be all right? Brynhildur. Logi? Is everything all right? What are you doing here? I'm... -Really, what are you doing here? -Jesus Christ. -I did it. -What? I did it. What? I don't follow. I gave the information to the paper. What do you mean? I didn't know you knew them. What do you mean? Were you... -Were you listening to us? -I didn't know you knew them. Have you been... What? Soffía and Pálmi... I don't know where to start. I'm sorry. -What's wrong with you? -I'm sorry. Do you understand what you did? Jesus. You're still the same pathetic loser. What's wrong with you? Hi. -Hi. -I talked to the police. -What did you tell them? -Nothing. You have a good thing going with the schoolgirls. Relax, I'm not going to tell them anything. You fucking better not. Keep on playing. Hello. Elfa. Hi, it's Gabríela from the police. Why didn't you tell me what Sigmundur did? What... Oh, just, Sigmundur... -Who is that? -Gabríela from the police. Don't talk to her without us being present. If this happens again, I'll file a complaint. Okay? Goodbye. Fuck. -Sigmundur? -Yes. My name is Gabríela. I'm a detective. -I wanted to talk to you. -Why? -Can I come in? -No. I don't know. Do you want to come down to the station? You don't look like you're sick. Why aren't you in school? -Where are your parents? -Abroad. Why didn't you like Lára? What? Who told you that? There have been complaints about your behavior towards the girls in your class. -That's bullshit. -Especially when they're drunk. Don't believe everything you hear. But we know that you were angry when she had you thrown out of the party the other day. Lára was always on the rag. What do you want? What's this? This information could only have come from you. Is it about that visit yesterday? How was I supposed to know he was a reporter? Did you really think we were worried about PR in this situation? -That's ridiculous. -Don't worry. It won't happen again. Anything else? You're going to Germany soon. Who will take over for Lára? Unnur. -Do you think she can do it? -I trust her. I hope the media won't find anything else. -Like what? -I hear things. Don't believe everything you hear. Okay, so you didn't see her at all. -Who is this? -My brother. -What's going on? -What happened to you? Nothing. What are you doing here? I was just chatting with your brother about Lára. He says he didn't see her at the dance. Can you tell me how he was able to get home? -Let your brother speak. -Sure. I saw him on the bus, wrote it in the register, -and then we went home. -Okay. -Just what he said. -That doesn't surprise me. Júlíus. It's strange that you were the last person to see her alive and you're also the alibi of the only guy we know -who was angry with her. -I wasn't... Shut up. Aren't you supposed to be sick? Júlíus. I will see you later. I didn't tell her anything about the fucking bus. Hi. Hi. Talk to me. Here is the information about the unregistered number. It was used for three weeks only to talk to her. -And the phone is still off? -Yes. Let's listen to it and Júlíus as well. Do you really think we should continue with this? -What do you mean? -Wasn't it just a suicide? Júlíus is fucking with us, Egill lied, and then there's the unregistered number. -Gabríela. -What? Hrafnhildur is going to close it. -Close it? -Yes. What do you mean? Have you read the documents? Yes, and the news. Isn't it obvious why she did it? No. Nothing says we should investigate further. -I've got witness reports. -Yes. I've heard about them. You talked to kids without their legal guardians. And how could you threaten a witness? Did Högni blab to you? -You don't have anything. -I want to continue. Allow me to take more witness statements and look at this Júlíus. If something new happens, I'll review my decision. We have to use our money for other things. Okay. The investigation has been stopped. -The case has been closed. -Until something new happens. But there are a lot of loose ends. Why did you stop, then? This is everything I found out. Look at it. You seem convinced that there is something more. It was obvious what she wanted. And what do the police say? Not enough evidence for further investigation. Shouldn't we trust them? Gabríela just about asked me to continue. -I'm not happy about this. -I can understand that. I want to do it for them. I can't forbid you to do it, but I don't like it. It's illegal. Remember that you can use your time to work for living children. Who can still be saved. Hi. How are you? How are you feeling? Did Mother talk to you? Yes, she did. I see. I'm sorry, but work has been hell. I just came from there. You're not in uniform. I haven't been in uniform for years, and you know it. Good. I meant everything I said. You have to do something about this. I know. What's this? Take a look. It's Lára's old Child Services case. You can see what they did to her. "Delete."
