 Here's some coffee for you. -How are you feeling? -Just, you know... I have to know. How do you know Þór? Where did you meet him? Well, of course I... I started going out when I was 14. That's when I met him. And then... I started doing drugs with him. He was great fun. We were good friends. He did everything for me.

 We were great friends. And then... That changed. He caught me when I was doing hard drugs. He controlled me. Then he started... He sold me. The first... First I met some disgusting old guy. He was revolting. He hurt me a lot. Grabbed my hair. Bit me... Put things inside me. Yes. Then it...

 Then he sold me again and again. That's the way it was. He sold me and... We weren't friends for much longer. -Do you have more Conta? -No, that was it. Shit. -I have to get some. -I have to meet Þór. What? I won't tell him about this, but I have to meet him. Don't tell him anything. I won't. Just stay here. Don't go. Promise? Then you have to get me something. I will, but don't go. Who is it? The police. It will be all right. She's going away. -Hi there. -Is Þór here? -No, he went out. -When will he be back? I don't know. I have to see him. Come by later, he will be here then. -There will be a great party. -Okay, I will. -I have to go. -Wait. I talked to Logi. He's got some. Thanks. This is a death sentence for the dance company. I will take this to the police. Unless you start talking. What happened? I had nothing to do with it. If you confess, I won't mention it. You will go to jail. The dance will continue. I didn't do anything. Lára was going to tell. She was going to destroy everything. Yes... You are talking about murder. Lára was my star. In front of me is a petition for a prohibition and protest on the memorial fund of Lára Jónasardóttir. Do the lawyers want to say anything? Not at the moment. I'm required to ask if a deal is possible. I don't think so. If that is the case, I have to tell you that if the prohibition order is agreed upon we will ask for five million as a guarantee. Can you pay? That won't be a problem. She's gone. He is obsessed by the case. So Gabríela has leaked information to Logi -through Brynhildur. -Yes. I'm very afraid for him. We will do what we can. Where are you? -I'm outside Þór's place. -Why on Earth? -He took the picture of Lára. -Are you sure? -Hanna told me. -Oh, okay, Benedetto was here. There are sick things going on at the dance company. He makes the girls bully each other and forces them to take drugs. Do you think there's a connection? I don't know. I have to go. Before he hung up on me he said he was following him. I don't know what he is doing. Who is this Þór Sæmundsson? He's been in and out of the system all his life. He's well known at Child Services. People know what he's doing, but nobody can stop him. -Why? -Nobody has the guts to report him. Not only that, nobody has the guts to bear witness against him. Nothing sticks to him. Never. He seems to be like a wild animal. He is very dangerous. Isn't this a matter for the police? I will talk to Gabríela. What? Þór? Logi knows he took the photograph. -How did he find that out? -Hanna told him. -Where is Hanna? -I don't know, -but Logi is at Þór's place. -Wait... What is Logi going to do at Þór's place? I don't know, but I don't like it. -You need to do something. -I'll see what I can do. Okay, bye. -I have to go. -Why did you lie to me? Hrafnhildur wants to speak to you. I just don't believe you leaked the evidence. She is waiting. I'm not coming near this. You have to deal with this yourself. Come. Þór, Logi is here. He wants to see you. Logi? Okay. Keep her here. Come on. -What do you want? -Lára, the ballet girl. What about her? You took nude photographs of her. Really? Did I do that? Are you saying you had nothing to do with it? Yes. The police don't agree. The police? This could be dangerous. You have to tell me what happened so I can prepare your defense. What are you talking about? Þór... Logi... Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out. What were you thinking? -I didn't do anything. -Don't try this. Who is your source? Did he give you any evidence? Did he give a formal report? Then I didn't do anything. What's going on? It was wrong to close the case. So you started working solo, got outside help and gave them confidential information? Okay, since you are so obsessed about the case, is there something new? I think I can prove who took the photo of Lára. You think? Gabríela, is there some other reason why you are investigating the case? You are putting me in a terrible position. I will not be caught giving you special favors because you are a woman. You know I have to start a formal investigation. I'm not sending you on leave, but in the meantime Högni will be in charge and you tell him everything you do. -You must be joking. -No, I'm not. "Transfer of funds." I had to do it. But it doesn't mean we can't make it right. We will continue to work together. Wait, in what way? -I'm told you are to babysit me. -No. To make sure I don't do anything stupid. It won't be like that. -I can't order you about. -Good. I'm going to keep investigating the case. Are you trying to lose your job? Okay, good luck. Where were you? -Really? -I didn't talk to the police. No, I didn't talk to the police! What? Yes. Dóri! Dóri! The police are coming. Throw everyone out and the stuff as well. And get rid of her. Relax, man! Fuck... Yes. -It's here. -What? That's not mine. Fuck you, it's not mine. Do you find this fun? Where is Hanna? She's gone. Oh? She didn't want to be here anymore. Did she tell you where she was going? No. I don't own the stuff. -Did the police plant it? -Plant? What are you talking about? They wouldn't dare. You know they are also investigating Lára's case. And? They are keeping you on ice while they collect evidence. -Want some? -No, thanks. -I met Logi downstairs. -Okay. He is representing Þór Sæmundsson. -Why was he arrested? -Drugs as usual. -Is he being interrogated? -I don't know. I didn't have anything to do with that slut. The police have traced the nude photographs to you. They have found the texts threatening her. They will think that you took her to the theater where you raped her and then killed her. No. It wasn't like that. What happened? I didn't kill her. I took the photos. I got her to meet me outside the dance. I drove her to the theater and more. But I was told to do it. Who told you? It doesn't matter. -Is Þór Sæmundsson in there? -Yes. Has the interrogation started? I think he is with his lawyer. Stop this bullshit. I'm telling you the truth. You better start making sense. Listen. A few months ago a man contacted me on the Internet. He said we had a common hobby. He asked me to get him girls and he would pay me. How old were they? Young. As young as possible. But they had to be dirty drug users that no one would miss. -How did you choose them? -I didn't. He sent me names and extensive information, so I could get control over them. -Lára was not one of them. -No. She was very different. That was the fucking problem, she was different. He sent me information about her, the school, the ballet... And that she was adopted from some shit family. Then he asked for a nude photo of her. Nothing else. Usually it's no problem. They want drugs, don't know anything and just follow orders. But Lára was different. I was going to give up, but the guy didn't want to let her go. Then we got new information. -I knew her sister. -Hanna. I got her to drug her... Then I took photos. And what then? A few weeks later he contacted me again. The nude photos weren't enough. This is taking a lot of time. It takes time. Why the hell the theater? I told you he selected the places. And what? I've got nothing more to say. -And you don't know who he is. -No. You're not an idiot. You know nobody believes you unless there is hardcore proof. I wasn't born yesterday. I know. He never had direct contact with the girls. I made them come to him. I picked them up and drove them somewhere, usually to the bus station. One time I waited for him. I saw him come, he picked her up and drove away. I recorded it. -It's safe on a server. -So why don't you know who it is? The quality was bad and he was far away. We can use it. Are you going to give it to me? -Yes. -How long will it take? No time at all. I just have to go home. You can meet me tonight. Okay. I'll try to get you out. Let us talk. What are you doing here? You have to let him go. They only found food supplements. What game are you playing? Brynhildur said you found out it was Þór that took the photos -and now suddenly you're his lawyer? -Relax. I'm doing what I have to do. Give me until tonight. I will contact you. You have to let him go. -Where is Hanna? -Don't worry about her. I'll see you later. The sheriff said no. You don't have a legal standing to prohibit the donations. Can't we do anything? We can ask a judge, but I seriously doubt it will change anything. Logi is down at the police station -as Þór Sæmundsson's defense lawyer. -Þór's? Yes, do you know him? No. I've just heard about him. A lot of former junkies are my patients and they often mention him. -Is this connected to our case? -Yes. It's possible that Þór took that revolting photo of Lára. Sorry, I have to go. But I will talk to you when something happens. Get the fuck out. You have stolen evidence from us. That's a serious allegation. We've always had a good working relationship. -Let's not destroy that. -Of course not. -Did you talk to Þór Sæmundsson? -Yes. We have to talk. What laws haven't you broken? I did what I had to do. We can close the firm if people hear about this. And what will happen when the police find out? I'm meeting him tonight. I'll get the video. -We are going to nail him. -But it's dangerous. For you and us. Relax, nobody is going to hear about it. Þór is going to show me who did it. He is lying to you. Can't you see that? -I believe him. -This can't stand, Benedikt. -Should we try to calm down? -Either go to the police or you won't be coming in tomorrow. What's wrong with you? This is a major break in the case and you want to hand it to the police idiots. Which is it? Listen, that doctor, Jónas Waage... -Yes? -...is outside your house. What? He is parked outside. Should I do something? -No, I will talk to him. -Are you sure? Yes, just go home. Maybe he has the drugs. -He's given in. -Yes. -Let's see. I will talk to you later. -Okay. Has Hanna returned? No. Þór said someone else was behind this. Can't you stop thinking about it for a while? I miss you. -What, is there a feast? -Yeah. -Do you want a biscuit? -No, thank you. It's a bit hot. Gabríela... Did you break your arm while bicycling? Yes, when you were a kid. Did mom tell you? -No. -Then who? I remember it. What do you mean? What do you remember? Not much. Sigfús says it will take time. You were always babysitting me. The coffee is disgusting. Aren't you in the wrong house, old man? You don't know me. I suspected as much. Why did you put the photograph of Lára online? You were just supposed to calm the psychiatrist. Yeah... I didn't expect this. But I didn't kill her. No, she committed suicide. What do you want? -Did you film me? -Yes. Where is it? In a good place. Who can access it? Only me. Þór. Þór. Hello? Þór! Well, my darlings, Bon Appétit. Wonderful, Mum. -Thank you, darling. Should I help Lísa? -Yes, please. -Do you want green peas or red peas? -Green. Ásvallablettur 716. Great. See those lips. See those breasts. -Are you afraid? -No. No? Let me see you. Let me... Let me see you. -Now you're afraid, aren't you? -No. Go down. Look at me. Look at me. Take your panties off. Get your panties off. Lay on your back.
