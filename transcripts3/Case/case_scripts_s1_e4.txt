 Is it painful? Yes. Take your clothes and come with me. You know you are my property. -Right? -Yes. Rakel's condition is very unique. Yes. As you know, I talked to your parents. Do you have any idea when it started? No. They said the first signs came when she was a teenager. That might be right. She is very smart.

 Your mother said the same applied to you. She always thought you would become an academic. I'm not your patient. You decided to become a policewoman. It's very unusual. A psychotic episode and loss of memory... That's usually because of mental trauma. You have no idea what might have happened? No. We have to find out what it was. The drive only contains videos. I can't find Lára there. And no girl is both there and on the website. Bloody hell, there must be something. I know those boys are connected to the case. Yes, but I haven't found a connection yet. Can't they fuck without filming it and putting it online? Crazy. I'm off. Where? There is nothing on the drive. Just a few hundred children's cases. I know but that's not what I'm investigating. -We can't ignore this. -You do what you want. See you later. Thanks for calling. Yes. Bye. One more. People have read the news and want to support us. I talked to the journalist. He asked if we were going to do more. Like what? A memorial fund. Yeah? How do we do that? How could this happen? Is it on the same site Elfa Dögg is on? No, it's not the same site. Who put the picture on the web? We don't know. Can't you find out? Can just anybody put pictures on the Internet? Yes. That seems to be the case. Someone has to remove the pictures. That's not possible, I'm told. But she is dead. -I think that doesn't matter. -What do you mean? You know... Those guys who masturbate over pictures of our daughter don't care if she is alive or dead. -Hello, Ögmundur. -What are you doing here? Have you been behaving? I've been trying. -What's this? -Important evidence. What can you tell me about this picture? -Where did you find it? -Gandreið.org. -Is she doing drugs? -No. Why? That's the kind of girl this happens to. They get some of them to send them pictures. Then it ends up in a bloody mess. What purpose could this picture serve? -Why? -None of your business. -She didn't do drugs. -Sure? Then I would ask all her former boyfriends and her family. The closest ones to her. Ready? Come on. Stop. That is terrible. What are you doing? You're shit. Let's try again. Music. It's even worse. I know you talked to the police. Girls, come here. Look at her. Turn around. Turn around. Look. She is a fat fuck. That's what happens when you only think about yourself and not about the group. She's too fat to dance. She spoils it for the rest of us. That's not on. Is it? You are finished today. Music. Ilmur. Do we still have access to Jónas's computer? Yes. I want to check it again. What are you thinking about? That's quite a bombshell you're giving me. I know. How is Elfa Dögg? She is still in danger. Is there nothing with Lára there? No. And you have only found one picture of her on the site. Yes. What was going on with her? How well did you know her? I haven't been in much contact recently. How about Jónas and Guðný? Just... They are nice people. Glóey. Talk to me. -Why? -Just talk to me, it won't take long. -About what? -Just talk to me. We wanted to do it for her. Honor her memory. Yes, that's no problem. But... Even if she wasn't always with us? Yes, that doesn't matter. We can help you create a fund. That's great. Thank you. You have to take a look at this. It might be Jónas. What? He wrote down everything his daughter did. -In Excel. -Did you access his computer again? Yes, we said we wanted to check it out. -What is wrong with you? -He lied to me. -What makes you think so? -Look at this. Detailed information about her. When she was at school, in ballet, everything. He stalked his daughter. -This doesn't prove anything. -Show her. These are the recordings from the night she died. Take a look at this. It's his car. See the time. -Just past 8:00. -It's his car. He told the police he was home all night. Here he is again just before midnight. He wasn't at home. We have to give this to the police. We are going to finish the case. What are we supposed to do? Accuse them of killing their daughter? I was thinking you should talk to Guðný. -Maybe she knew where he went. -No, they are my friends. Either you talk to them or I will. Hi there. -Half an hour. -An hour. -Okay. -Come on. See you. I know. Yes. It was a lie. Yes, I'm sure. I'm sorry. Okay. Tell Logi I'm ready to pay double. -He isn't going to sell. -How do I change his mind? Why does this matter so much to you? That Jónas is a psychiatrist. There is a lot of money there. Understand? Logi doesn't have to know. Nobody has to know. What do you say? No. -Okay. Triple the amount. -The money doesn't matter. I'll be in touch. Let's talk to Logi himself. Let's call him. I spoke to her parents. She is still at the hospital, but we can visit later. Good. Let's hear what Elfa Dögg has to say. We don't have any evidence on Júlíus regarding Lára. Tóti is looking at the picture. There is no way to tell where it was taken. It could have been taken at her home. -Do you suspect her father? -No. But I'm saying the picture changes everything. -How so? -The guy who took the picture is the guy with the unregistered phone, the guy who forced her to have sex. That's the reason she decided to kill herself. -Isn't that a bit of a stretch? -No. I'm sure that's what happened. The police are checking the site. I'm sure they will contact us soon. As soon as something... Great. They must find something out. Let's hope so. I didn't get any... Don't misunderstand me. I have to ask. I have to ask about the family. We are just trying to eliminate all possibilities. Get them off the table. I have to ask... Where was Jónas the night Lára died? Wait... What are you suggesting? Nothing. It would be nice to know. He was with me the whole night. -Hi there. -Hi, what do you want? What do I want? -I just want to offer you a drink. -No, thanks. On the house. Brynhildur asked me to meet her today. What did she say? She was asking about you. Where you were the night Lára died. And what did you say? I said that you had been with me all night. I know you would never do anything to Lára. But where were you? I needed to clear my mind. -For three hours? -Yes. For more than three hours. -Want something more to drink? -Yeah. Let's go all the fucking way! -Am I disturbing you? -No. But what are you doing here? -Are you nuts? -You are under arrest. You decide if you want to talk. -Can you just barge in? -Yes. When we have a warrant. Your lawyer is on the way. I'm not saying anything until he comes. No problem. We have enough evidence. The interview is just a formality. But you could help me with one thing. Tell me about forging Lára's name in the register. Put his hand on your breast. That's enough. Get dressed. -How did it go yesterday? -She lied to me. She said Jónas was with her that night. Shit. I have to talk to him. Careful, otherwise he will find out you leaked to the press. I've got the recordings from the security camera. -Okay. -Let's talk later. Hi. Where were you all night? I worked late and slept in the car. Guðný talked to Brynhildur yesterday. So you want to maintain that you never went out. -Yes. -Even though that's a lie. What do you mean? A security camera shows you driving away around 8:00 and coming back three hours later. Where the hell were you? I had to clear my mind. Go for a long drive. -May I interrupt? -Yes. -I want to ask you to open the case again. -Why? Have you seen the new information? This Júlíus is a disgusting pervert, but there isn't a direct connection. Sex crimes division has his case. That's not what I'm talking about. Look... Júlíus admitted forging her name in the register. That means that we don't know where Lára was for three or four hours. I think she went out to meet someone who was trying to blackmail her with the photo. An interesting theory. Do you have proof? The photo. It could explain the suicide but nothing else. You know what effect pictures like that have on those kids. Are we always going to let those responsible get away? You can't prove the photo made her kill herself. Someone is responsible. Gabríela. I'm sympathetic towards her parents, but there is nothing we can do. Okay. Does Guðný know you stole money from the Association of Adoptive Parents? -How do you know about that? -Does it matter? -Did you break in? -You haven't answered. Does Guðný know? I have all the time in the world. I didn't meet Lára that night. A few months ago I saw... Changes in her. I tried to talk to her, but... She threw up a wall. Wasn't she just being a teenager? No, this was something different. I know my daughter. -Do you have children? -No. Yes, but I'm not allowed to see him. You feel these kind of changes. Did Lára have a friend in the ballet? Glóey. Unnur was also nice to her. It is... Just... Terrible to see your child disappear slowly. I started to document what she did and it turned out it was all about the ballet. In what way? I didn't know that girl in the ballet. My happy and joyful girl was like some kind of robot. As the opening night got closer I saw a new side of her. What do you mean? There is something unnatural there. That Benedetto is crazy. But you allowed her to continue. That's what I was doing that night. I went home to Benedetto to give him a piece of my mind. But he wasn't home. Why did it take such a long time? I was upset and just drove around. Why haven't you told anybody? Because, Logi... While I was driving around and pitying myself... My daughter was hanging herself. -Are you all right? -No. -I'm very sorry about it. -Are you? We don't agree, but... I know it matters to you. Come on. I know we haven't been the best of friends because of Lára's case, but Lísa says... -Lísa who? -Lísa who? She's my wife. Yes. Sorry. Anyway... Lísa says that a good working relationship is based on trust, but when there is negative energy it often creates a spiral, which hinders us, not only personally but also at work. Högni. It's no problem. Yes, it is. We have to work through it. -Lísa says... -Really, it's no problem. Do you want to come to dinner tonight? No, thank you. I promised you would come. Please. -Okay. -Thank you. -6:30 p.m.? -Tonight. Thank you. -Get out. I'm not talking to you. -I'm not here to talk to you, -I want to talk to Glóey. -She's not here. -I was told she was here. Glóey. -She's not here. Get out. Where were you between 9:00 and 12:00 the night she died? -None of your business. -Do you have something to hide? No. I know you weren't at home. Get the fuck out of here. You said they were sketches. Aren't these sketches? Isn't life just one big sketch? Here you are. Just a vague notion of perfection? This is his favorite. We have talked a lot about the suicide you were investigating. That girl must have had terrible karma. He just doesn't want to understand that he has to find out why she had such terrible karma. Is it because she slept with her dad... Or someone else, or is it the nude photo? We can't base the investigation on some Oriental religion. There is nothing in the law about karma. Won't you try to get out of your box, darling? You are such a square. Yes, let's go outside the box. This doesn't change the fact that Högni feels that you don't listen enough to his opinions. You have to discuss it. You are so repressed, the both of you. Have some. Thanks. Yes. It's Guðný, you have to come right away. -What? -We found something. How's coming out of the closet going? Terribly. Really? And you have a sister who has mental problems. She just says what she thinks. That must be uncomfortable. No, she's just what she is. -Have you taken her to a healer? -No. I know of one who is... You know who it is. He is very good. I'll get his phone number. -No, you don't need to... -I will. Sorry about this. She's just what she is. You can go... We can say you were called out. No, it's no problem. What's going on? I have been looking at this disgusting page. This is Hanna. Lára's sister.
