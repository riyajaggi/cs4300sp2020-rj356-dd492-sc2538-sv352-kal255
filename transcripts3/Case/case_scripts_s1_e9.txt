 Where is Indiana? Who cares? You are disgusting. I'm just doing what you dream of doing, right? What do you mean? Wasn't it this you were looking for when you touched Hanna's small and perky breasts? -That was different. -Really? She wanted it. I have never forced anyone to do anything. You are a child predator.

 Not at all. Children are innocents who are not sexually mature. Stop this bullshit. They were children. Consent... The age of consent depends on the vagaries of the age. I would rather call it a specialized taste, which is illegal at this point in time. You should understand. Did you feel you were a child predator when you had sex with Hanna? Stop talking about her. Well, then... We should find out how we can help you. -Help me? -I'm your lawyer. Are you crazy?

 Drinking, drugs, promiscuity. And the conspiracy theories, that won't make things easier for you. They think you are insane. Maybe we can use that. Get out. Don't lose your sense of humor. Tell me... What was your daughter like after you raped her? I never touched her. But you wanted to fuck her. Right? Are you sensitive about your little princess? That is the difference between you and me. I am able to distinguish between wanting and doing. So you just found other girls to rape so you wouldn't rape your own daughter. I never touched her. You just found other girls to abuse instead. Abuse? I always gave them a choice. He... I know. What should I do? We will figure it out. -Are you her sister? -Yes. Can you tell me what happened? Can you tell me about the rapist? No. Nothing. Clothes? Anything. I don't think she wants to talk about it right now. It's all a blur... Can I examine you? Okay. Let's go. What do you really want? Why do you never believe what you see? Because I know how men like you think. You never do anything unless you profit. How do you know? I'm the same. I'm helping you. We are more alike than you think. -I don't abuse small girls. -What about Hanna? And Ilmur? You chose to sleep with them. I didn't. You think it's all right because you have let society program you with ethical bullshit which doesn't fit people like us. I'm not going to let morals made in some feminist club take away my right to satisfy my needs. I take what I want. No rules, systems or ethics can stop me. And you are just the same. You fought the system all the way. While others were angry at you or laughed at you, I admired you. I know what it's like to stand apart. I'm ready to help. I will do everything to help you. What about Lára? Are you still thinking about Lára? That's not on me. It was Jónas' fault. He had been warned repeatedly. It is easy to imagine that a loving father -finds it hard to play the detective. -He tried to stop you. -Wouldn't you have done the same thing? -You killed her. Logi, that's the reason nobody believes you anymore. You have no concept of reality. Lára committed suicide. Nobody disputes it. And why would she do that, I wonder? Suicide is always a choice. -You are responsible. -Come on, don't be childish. What happened to her was very sad but it's not my fault. You had it all planned, didn't you? To frame me. So I would have to work for you. I'm flattered, but no. You did it yourself. What did you expect when an alcoholic, fraudulent drug addict starts investigating a criminal case? So what do you say? Shouldn't we start looking at your defense? What did you do with Indiana? Why do you want to know that? If I'm like you, I have to know what you do. I enjoyed it especially much with her because I imagined she was the first to belong to both of us. -What happened? -You know what happened. Either you trust me or you don't. I offered her what she desired and she let me do whatever I wanted. -Did you put a metal object... -Of course. Why? The freedom I will give you will open the door to all kinds of desires which you didn't know you harbored. You will understand when you get to know your own desires. Take him to interrogation. Any internal bleeding? Yes, please. Thank you. -Brynhildur is at the hospital. -What do you mean? She was found on the stairs at work. She is in very bad condition. What happened? She seems to have fallen quite a distance. She's badly broken. Was she alone? Yes, she had been lying there for quite a while. Strange. He is talking to his lawyer. -What lawyer? -Benedikt Hreiðarsson. Why the hell didn't anybody tell me? Okay. I'm a promiscuous alcoholic. Dishonest. A real creep sometimes. But the difference between us is that I'm not insane. -Just... -You have created crazy notions to justify your depraved behavior. Like you deserve something. Nobody deserves anything. Least of all creeps like you. -You will regret this. -Get the fuck out. Your loss. Without my help you will go to jail, and while you rot in prison, I will take what I want. Maybe I will send you a rose each time I do a small princess. -Don't be so sure. -Oh? What are you going to do? You won't get away with it. You mean that little expedition you sent Brynhildur on? It won't be much use to you. She will see through you. If she lives. -What do you mean? -Oh, you haven't heard? Earlier tonight Brynhildur fell down the stairs at the office. Relax! Calm down. Okay, now we'll wait for a moment. She has obvious trauma. Very strange trauma. I recommend that you report it. Okay. I'm taking her home. I'll talk to our parents. -Here is a pamphlet. -Thank you. -Good luck. -Thank you. What are you doing? We won. Now we can... Now we can move forward. I wanted to... To celebrate. Just once. No. -We are not doing this. -I just... Okay. It doesn't look good for you. -Will she be all right? -Who? What happened? What are you talking about? He did it. Benedikt pushed her. You have to find that bloody video Þór recorded. Do you think he is the man? Is that the reason why you attacked him? Yes. He is not done. Don't tell me you believe him. He's been sure the whole time that it wasn't just Þór. Why would he talk about someone else if that someone else is then he himself? It doesn't make any sense. I've known Benedikt for more than 20 years. He can be difficult, but this is nonsense. You don't look good. Should I get you some stuff? No, it's all right. We must let her stay here. She doesn't want to go to her parents. She can go to rehab in two days. It is just two days. Okay. How well did you know Þór? That's not important. We know you were at the theater the night Lára died. Are you going to try to deny it? Are you joking? I had been drinking the night before. I slept in my car outside the theater because I had been drinking. -Really? -Did you stay in your car all night? Look... Nobody is denying that I made a lot of mistakes. I helped Þór with many things I shouldn't have. I had sex with Hanna. I'm not proud of that. Is there no way to access the server? Well, I don't know how to do it. I sent what I got to the Sexual Crimes Division. Logi is always talking about this video. It's the likeliest place for it. Does it matter? -Don't we have all we need? -I have to find that video. If it exists. Well, I'm off. Call me if something happens tonight. I will see you in the morning. -Good night. -Good night. How many times do I have to tell you? As often as we need you to. Let's start again. The night Lára died you were outside the theater. We have been sober for six years. Are you really going to destroy that? There is never just one time. You know that. I just... Just... It's our opportunity to do some good. Let's not fuck it up. Why aren't you inside? We are taking turns. Are you wearing him out? -He will surely cave in. -He will. Were you able to sleep? Yes. Slept like a baby. Meet me in 20 minutes at Loftið café. I have evidence about Logi. Tell me... Did you kill him to shut him up? I didn't kill Þór. We know you were at his place for an hour before you called the police. What were you doing? I don't know. I looked at his phone. I was in shock. I can't remember. A whole hour. -And you didn't see anyone else? -No. Can I do something for you? I can get you water. No. It will be all right. You know I can arrest you for hacking the police intranet. Yes, I know. -But you arrested the wrong man. -Oh? Logi didn't do it. It was that lawyer, Benedikt Hreiðarsson. He raped all those girls. Why do you think that? It happened again yesterday. He attacked another girl. -Who? -I can't tell you. -Has she reported it? -No. -Why not? -She's afraid. -You have to get her to report it. -I'm trying. Þór stored evidence there. Try to get in there and see what you find. Logi says there is a video that proves it was Benedikt. Okay. I'll check it out. Now you have to come. Your sister has locked herself in and only wants to talk to you. I can't come right away. I'm working. You said that yesterday. Something is wrong with your sister. -She needs you. -I'll try to come by later. -Okay? -Yeah. Okay. She doesn't want to tell us anything. It just happened. -I'll try to swing by later. -Thank you. -Okay? All right. Goodbye. -Goodbye. We have enough evidence to nail you. Why do you keep denying it? -What happened at the theater? -I've already told you. Are you saying it's just a coincidence? -I've told a million times. -That you parked by coincidence outside the place where your partner was raping a girl? Well? Are you listening to yourself? Can't you hear how ridiculous this sounds? What? Right... That was good news for you. Benedikt's operation was a success. You don't have to live with that. -I have some new... -Listen. I'm tired. Please let me sleep. Let's finish this first. I want to go to my cell. I want to sleep. First I have to hear you say it. I did it all. It has to be more specific. I'm the man behind Þór. I helped him with Lára at the theater. I also killed him. The interrogation of Logi Traustason is over. The time is 10:16 a.m. You have to talk to your parents. I just can't. It's much better. Well... Aren't you glad it's over? I just want to get into my cell. Yeah. Now we can sleep. Shouldn't I take him in? Sure. We are finished. -Why did you do it? -Leave me alone. -Your confession is false. -I want to sleep. Hi. I'm not doing this. If you are going to do this, you will do it alone. I'm sorry. Nonni! Forgive me. I've got the video. What video? The video Þór recorded. Let's look at it. Listen. Can you put this on the computer? Stop there. Are there more cars registered to Benedikt Hreiðarsson? It's not Logi's car at least. What's going on there? There are two cars at his address. IBF45 and ABE29. Wait... Why on Earth did Logi confess? Ásgeir here. We are coming to arrest Benedikt Hreiðarsson. -Can you check his condition? -Yes. What about Logi? He's all right, just sleeping. Wait... He isn't here... What do you mean, he isn't there? I don't know, he was sleeping earlier. -Where is Benedikt? -I don't know. Find out and go there. -What's his last name? -Hreiðarsson. Where is Benedikt Hreiðarsson? -On the general ward. -Where is that? Through the doors, third floor. I'm going in. Hi, Mom... I want to come home. The last request for a grant comes from the Church of Hallgrimur. Again? Not that one. The other one. -The Church of Saurbær. -Yes. It used to be called the Church of Hallgrimur. Anyway, the roof needs repairs. -How much do they want? -Four million. That should be okay. -We can't let that church rot. -No, we can not. Any other problems? Yes, there was the Church of Akureyri... Excuse me, I need to take this. Markús. I know what you did. I remember it. Everything.
