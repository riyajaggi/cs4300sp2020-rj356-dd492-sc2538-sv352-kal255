 Well... -Are you coming? -What? -Ready? -Yes. -Have you been inside? -We just arrived. -Is the ambulance on its way? -Yes. Okay, let's begin. He was going to meet us somewhere here. Was he alone in the house? So I'm told. Was he here all night or did he arrive this morning? I don't know.

 We're backstage. -Here is the stage. -Okay. I'm going to see if he can turn on the lights. -We need light. -Just a second. -Hello, my love. -Hi. I can't stay for long. -Did you bring it? -Yes. I forgot the earrings, sorry. No problem. I'll get them later. Maybe tonight? Maybe. I'll try. -I have to go. -Okay. -Lára. -No, it's me. -Are you going to eat with me? -Yes.

 When was Lára supposed to go to school? 12:00 or 1:00. Her bag is still here. Yes, she stayed overnight at Elfa's. -She hasn't been home. -Just call her. Hello, darling. Call me when you hear this. It's almost twelve o'clock. -I just used nuts instead. -It's very good. -Did she forget her keys? -Does she have keys? Good morning. My name is Gabríela, I'm a detective. -Does Lára Jónasardóttir reside here? -Yes. Can we come in? No! I'm sorry, but we have to ask you a few questions. Where was Lára last night? At the youth center with her friend Elfa Dögg. Did she have any business at the National Theater after that? No, she was going to stay at Elfa's place. We found an access card to the theater near the... On the stage. She was learning ballet at the theater. Hello, dear. Call as soon as you hear this. Stop it. Stop it. We'll give you a minute. Can we look at her room? It's upstairs. Please, Ilmur, I fell asleep in my car. I was drunk. I thought you never wanted to see Brynhildur again. No, I don't want to. Except when you're drunk. I told you, I wasn't with her. I'm not going anywhere. Let's take the computer. What's your problem with the office? I can't accept that I have the only office without windows. You're the lowest in rank. You're a representative. Yes, and I bring in a lot of business for the firm. -I don't know where to start... -It's simple. He's not happy. And we don't want our employees to be unhappy. No. We are one big family, and if someone is unhappy, we have to find a solution. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Friðbjörn, today you are the weakest link. -What? -Don't let us keep you. Take your things and be out of here within 10 minutes. Oh. Anything else? Great. -Cozy time? -Hey, there. Thanks for the tip, it was solid. Here's the money. -Do you have anything else for us? -No, that's it. -I'll see you later. -See you. Here you are. Her phone is not in the bag. -Coffee? -No, thanks. Let me know if you find her phone. Of course. We'd like to take her computer, if that's all right. Look through her emails, chat, etc. Yes. Thanks for coming. -Hello. -Hello. -Do you want coffee? -No. We're leaving, then. Thank you. -Sorry for your loss. -Sorry for your loss. Hi. -She's dead. -What? Who? Lára hanged herself. You can't tell anyone anything. Say you walked home alone after the dance. What's going on, Júlíus? Nothing, nothing is going on. Hello. What are you doing here? Can I come in? I... I'm afraid I don't have good news. Lára... She was found dead this morning. -What? -What did you say? She committed suicide. That's not possible. I am so sorry. -Good morning. -Good morning. My name is Gabríela. We're detectives. -Högni. -Hello. We'd like to speak to your daughter. Not now. She's in shock, like all of us. I understand, but we really have to talk to her. No, not now. I have to say no. Okay. Can we talk about your connection to the case? My connection? What are you talking about? Lára was going to stay the night here. But as you know, she didn't. Can you tell us why you didn't let anyone know? I don't know what you're talking about. Lára wasn't going to stay the night, not to my knowledge. We have to talk to her. She was Lára's best friend. Elfa told us she last saw Lára at the start of the dance. That's all she knows. You can talk to her tomorrow. Right now she... We all need some peace. Thank you. -Well. -That was great. Yes. Look at her messages. I need to know everything. Yes. We got a preliminary report from the technical division. Okay. They found DNA, but that doesn't tell us much. It was a stage, after all. Fuck... Isn't it just an obvious suicide? You can't fake that, as we know. They took her away from us. What do you want me to do? What you always do. Aren't they just some strangers? Then you shouldn't talk to me. We have done things for you and never asked for anything in return. Okay. Logi, hi. It's Þór. I'm not saying we were the best parents. No, we had problems with alcohol. That wasn't a secret. We never knew who complained to Child Services. But after that, we were lost in the system. The system turned against us. They sent people to follow us, watch us, and the reports kept coming. Reports about visits, doctor's reports, school reports, and what was it? A custody something. Yes, custody assessment report. And then they petitioned the court to remove her from our custody. -We couldn't stop them. -Who could be so evil? To take a small child from her parents. Guðný and Jónas. We were allowed to visit her twice a year. Under supervision. And then that was stopped. When Lára was five, Guðný and Jónas said that the visits had a detrimental effect on her. It was bullshit. She was always very happy when we came. Of course Child Services just believed them without doing any investigation. They were always making her do stuff... -Gymnastics and... -Piano lessons. And then ballet. We sometimes sneaked in to watch her. That was enough to see how she was treated. What do you mean? Guðný was always on the sidelines pressuring her. They were always... They were always criticizing her. Can you help us? Lára was a great companion, a great dancer, and a lovely girl. I know I speak for us all when I say she will be missed. Her passion, her contribution to this group, can't die with her. We will honor her memory by going on, by rehearsing more, by becoming better. Now, let us go home, be with our families, cry and seek comfort. But tomorrow we will keep on going. For Lára. No DNA was found on her. How is that possible? Hard to say. It just looks like a suicide. No indications of anything else? No. -Okay, thanks, I'll talk to you later. -No problem. -Good night. -Bye. The autopsy confirms it was a suicide. But there are things we still don't know. We don't know how she got there, her phone is still missing and the coroner says she had intercourse before she died. -In the theater? -We don't know. The time frame is three hours. It could have happened on the way, at the dance, or in the theater. -Was it rape? -He's not sure. -No DNA? -No, he probably used a condom. But we can't eliminate the possibility that she was raped, which may be the reason for the suicide. We have to find out who she slept with. I don't want to be a pain, but... Are we going to interview the 4,000 kids who were at the dance? No, we just talk to the people closest to her and map her last 24 hours. Can you be bothered to do that? -Yes. -Okay, great. Let's do it. Are you sure you want to do it? You saw them. Who else would do it? That's true. Can you check them out? Emails, Facebook, everything. Hi. Hi. What are you doing? -Don't... -Don't what? Don't what? -I did everything you told me to. -Yes, I know. Then why are you doing this? Listen... Look at me. I will stay silent if you will. What? -Don't you know what I'm talking about? -No. What? Okay. I'll call you. Thank you for coming. The autopsy confirms it was suicide. I see. So you won't do anything more? We will. There are things we want to look into more. We have been looking at her messages on the computer, and there is a name there... Egill. Was that her boyfriend? No. They had split up. I'm asking because it looks like she had intercourse just before she died. -Intercourse? -Yes, so it seems. -That's not possible. -She was very innocent. I know it's difficult... -What the hell do you know about that? -Guðný... -She wasn't your daughter. -Guðný... Jónas, it's very important to know who she slept with. That person could be the last person who saw her alive. Well. -That went well. -Jesus. Hi, babe. Aren't you supposed to be at school? They gave us the day off. Have the police talked to you? No, they're coming by later. You remember what we talked about? Do I have to lie? -Do I... -Wait... -Don't you love me? -I do. Of course. They say it was suicide... -But she had had intercourse. -She hadn't started having sex. I know very well that no parent wants to believe that their child has taken their own life, but... You know Lára and you know nothing was hidden, no drugs, she has friends, she has a boyfriend. -Had a boyfriend. -Yes. And they didn't have sex. I know because she would have told me. It doesn't make sense. And what was she doing in the theater? You're the only one who can help us. Can you make sure that we will be kept in the loop and they will follow it up? Yes. I'll talk to Gabríela. Hello. I'm very concerned about Lára's position in the group. Lára needs discipline... That's just Guðný. Where is Jónas? I'm still working on him. This is really good. -Haven't we got what we need? -No, let's keep going. Why? That broad is incredibly fucked up. -Hello. -Hello. -Sorry about yesterday. -No problem. Hello. -I trust that you will be gentle. -Of course. Do you know when she came home that night? No, it was after we fell asleep. They hang around outside the youth center after being bussed there. It wasn't the first time. -I must help them. -I see. Doing what? They think it wasn't suicide. What do you think? It was my first case. I had Lára taken away from her parents and given to them. Do you think you are responsible for what happened? I know it's not logical... But yes. In a way. Brynhildur, you do what you think you need to do. So you were going to smuggle clothes into the dance? Lára was, not me. They have very strict rules about clothing. Nothing too revealing. They found the clothes at the youth center. Then you went to the dance. What was Lára like? What was her mood like? Just the same as usual. And that's the last place you saw her? Can you remember when? At what time? Early, we went to the dance floor and I lost her soon after that. So she could have left the dance without you noticing. I don't think so. They have guards. The youth centers are responsible for the kids. What does that mean? That if Lára was able to get out past the guards, they would have noticed she was missing on the bus. Did you see her on the bus? No, I never saw her again. Aren't we finished here? Did she have a crush on anyone? Was she meeting someone at the dance or afterwards? No, I don't think so. Had she started having sex? What kind of question is that? No, we didn't do that. Where did you go after the dance? I told you when you came here. What difference does that make? Quite a lot if she was going to sleep here. I didn't know about that. Wasn't it strange not seeing her after the bus ride home? I just thought she had gone home. You have to tell me the truth. -She was your best friend. -Isn't that enough? -Exactly. -You have to tell me, for her sake. -Can we stop now? -This conversation is over. Thank you. We'll be in contact if we need to talk to her again. Hello, you're Benedetto, right? Yes. Can I help you with something? I'm the theater's lawyer. It's about the investigation regarding Lára. What investigation? It would be terrible if the parents sued. -Sued because of what? -We're just being cautious. Tell me about the girl. She is... Was the greatest talent I've ever seen. At 14 she was better than all the other dancers. And nothing unusual happened? She fell during a performance the other day. That was unusual for her, but can happen to anybody. I've heard that Guðný was ambitious. I don't want to say anything about the mother. It's just a precaution. I hope we won't have to use any of this. Júlli. Someone to talk to you. Hello, I'm Högni. Hello, I'm Gabríela. We're detectives. Júlíus. We wanted to talk to you about Lára Jónasardóttir. Yes. -Shall we go into the office? -No, we won't be a moment. What can you tell us about that night? There was nothing unusual about it. I saw her on the bus, wrote it down. -So she was on the bus? -Sure. And then she walked... Home, probably. I don't know anything else. Do you know if someone saw her walk home? No, I don't know. Is it possible that the kids were able to sneak out of the dance to do something? What do you mean? To drink, have sex. No, it's very unlikely. We watch them closely. Anything else? Do you remember what she was wearing? -Wearing? -Yes, wasn't there some trouble because of clothes being confiscated? Nothing more than usual. Did you take any clothes from Lára? Yes, a yellow top and a short black skirt. Did you find her cute? That was quite exact. She was cute. Everybody knew that. What? What do you do with the clothes? We return them. I expect Lára got her clothes back. So you didn't return them to her yourself? Yes, I did. I returned the clothes to her. -On the bus? -Yes. -Was there anything else? -No. -Hi. -Hi. That broad is nuts. The ballet teacher said so as well. He did? Well, the father is nuts, too. He's been stealing money from the Society of Adoptive Parents. He's the treasurer. What? Can you hack into his bank account? Yes, but that wouldn't tell us everything. We have to look at his books. Let's start with Guðný. Maybe we have something there. -Aren't you going home? -Sure. But I can't sleep because of the sun. It can be hell. -Don't you have blinds? -Sure. But I can't be bothered to put them up. -Is that her Facebook page? -Yes. If they were best friends, isn't it a bit strange that Elfa didn't look for Lára at the dance? Didn't try to call her or anything? And that Júlíus... He's sleazy. I didn't believe a word he said. We must find out who she had sex with. Wasn't it just her ex-boyfriend? I don't know, he's abroad. Was he abroad when it happened? No. He's coming back tomorrow. Her parents had no idea she was having sex. They didn't know anything. Isn't it just kids today? Different times? Look at her. She's just a kid. That's true. Shouldn't we go home? Get a cold one? I don't think so. Come on. How long have we worked together? We've never gone anywhere. -Am I that boring? -No. Not at all. -Not so boring? -No. Okay, come on, then. A marriage is an agreement. We have a clear division of labor. Each has their own chores. I do the bathroom, mirrors, windows... I do it before 6:00 in the morning. Then I have finished my part. Then I have time for my paintings at night. What about the paintings? Aren't you going to bring them to the station? They're just sketches. What about you? Don't you have any hobbies? I haven't seen you with any guys in all the time we've been working together. -Are you a lesbian? -What? No, I... Just... We were talking about it at the station. I'm not... The family takes part in Gay Pride and so on. You know... Happy, happy. Long live diversity. I'm going home. See you later. Thanks for the beer. Child Services seems to be able to attack people like us, take our children away and put them in the hands of some rich bastards. It's not fair. They shouldn't be able to get away with it. It's not fair. You had some evidence, right? These are emails from Guðný to the theater. She complains again and again that the theater isn't ambitious enough. The ballet teacher confirms it. He says she was intolerable. Always interfering. Always pressuring her to do better. You know I can't quote some people just because you said so. I know. I recorded the conversation. Can we use it? I'll see what I can do. -Are you taking a picture? -No, just a video. -Smile. -No. Say something funny. Stop it. Dance for me. -Do a pirouette. -No. That was great. -And a split. -No. -And to the kitchen. -Stop. -And a split. -Stop. Have you heard?
