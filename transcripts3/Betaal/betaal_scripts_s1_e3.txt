 You don't know... what terror you've unleashed upon this world. You don't know... what you're fighting against. The colonel's army has you surrounded. And when he gives the command, they will strike. Who are they? Those Britishers stole the powers from the spirits. This was their most dangerous regiment... the 90th Taunton Volunteers... from the darkest swamps of Britain.

 They never hesitated to go to any lengths to get what they wanted. They never faced defeat. Death was their favorite game. And all this happened... under the leadership of a tyrant officer... Colonel John Lynedoch. His greed drove him crazy. He desired to be the sole emperor of British India, and for everyone to bow at his feet. He believed in black magic. During the mutiny of 1857... Colonel Lynedoch and his company were building a tunnel and the rebels trapped them inside it and buried them alive.

 But the colonel was not someone who was scared easily. Using black magic, he evoked the Betaal... so it could bestow its powers upon him. He sacrificed his own son. Alone... in the dark... his own men gradually fell prey to him. Look at their condition now. Look... at my condition now. Our army is unmatched. We see as one... we march as one... we think alike. His thoughts. We follow orders... and satiate our hunger. After rotting in hell... every day for 160 years... we are very... very... very hungry. You think alike, you see as one... but do you all feel the same pain? How can we defeat them? The girl. Hand over the child to us. Once we have the kid... we might let you live. I've decided that we won't make any more stupid deals. No! No! If anyone lays a finger on my cousin... "Betaal, Lord of Spirits." A threshold god formerly of some importance. Now an outcast seeking solitude and eternal... Don't look at me like that. Saanvi... come here. Come here. Vikram... I have to tell you something. What? Sorry for doubting you. What does it mean? "The one that harnesses the Betaal's power" will be trapped in the mountain. To escape, it requires a sacrifice on the holy altar of the mountain. Preferably, from the female sex. "Preferably, before she has bled." That's rubbish. Ahlu... all this is our fault. - We were just... - We were just following orders. But that little girl, Saanvi, if we can't save her, then we're a disgrace to the Baaz Squad. I agree. I want you to promise me something. Tell me. If I ever turn into AC Haq... don't fucking hesitate, just put a bullet in me. Stop being crazy. We're getting out of here alive. You hear me? Alive, not half dead, nor the living dead. - Undead. - Yes, whatever. - We're the fucking Baaz Squad. - Right. Bloody white men. First, they plundered our country, then our jobs... then our gold, our land... and now these assholes have even stolen our evil spirits! He is waking up. He is waking up. - He is waking up? - He is waking up. - He is waking up. - Who is waking up? "The signs of such a possession - the whitening of the hair..." the adopting of a pronounced stoop, "a psychic link to his army." Saanvi... Saanvi... Father... Father, there's a man there. I just saw him. Father... There's no one there. Father, look there. Father, there's a man there. Father... Saanvi... Hey, Saanvi! What happened? Who fired? Squad, report. Cousin, do you recognize me? Can I do something... to fix you, cousin? Forgive me, cousin... but I only see... a piece of meat. That's all. Baaz Squad, assemble at the main hall. Fast. We've done our best to make a secure perimeter. Back entrance is solid, but the front exit isn't so strong. We have cameras for surveillance and we've almost 75% ammunition left. Is this necessary? I was just checking if you are still feeling weak... or maybe uneasy. I am not pregnant, Deputy Commandant. I am fine. Can you see properly? Just your stupidity. I am fit for command and I am sure I can muster myself until the CM's convoy arrives. Right now, we just have to survive the night, got it? Yes, ma'am. And Sirohi, you know nothing about these things out there. Ma'am, I know. These villagers are helping us. They have a few things in the armory, which will help us defend against them. Things? What do you mean? - What things? - Turmeric, salt, and ashes. Ridiculous. These two should be in custody. Hey, I saved that girl. Girl. "My prize will be ruling over this barbarian land... bending all to my will, endless wealth..." Father, I saw him. I saw him. Wait... let me think. I am telling you... I saw him. It was a man... right behind Tyagi ma'am. Was this him? Yes! That's him. Seems like... we're trapped in a nightmare. So many died. And what for? What the fuck? Just for one kid? Sir, that fucker is back. I had shot him. Ahlu, check the perimeter. Sides and rear exit clear, Sirohi. But the front is theirs. Look at how many they are. We should hand the child over to them. Dad, please, tell uncle Vikram. Do you even know what's going on here? You think I am stupid... but I know everything. What do you know? You blew up that worker. You opened that tunnel. This is all your fault! Mom was right about you. You're selfish and mean. Insolent girl! How dare you answer back to me? I will tell everyone what you and Bhunnu uncle did! They will punish you! Only cowards raise their hands to children! Understand? Puniya. Get her. Come with me. Saanvi. Saanvi! Sirohi... - They took my child. - Who? The tribals. They took Saanvi. Sirohi, get her back. Right now! They are at the rear exit. - It's dangerous outside! - So what? We're not safe in here either. Hey, girl, listen to me... if that woman in charge gets her hands on you, she will turn you over to the dead outside. Do you want that? Do you want to become their dinner? You don't, right? Then stay with me. Rear door. Stop! - Sirohi! - Ahlu, take Saanvi away from here! - Where? - Somewhere safe! Just go! Come on, stay close. Fuck! Keys! They have keys! Oh, no! Of course they do. They are the ones who built this place. Where is Saanvi? Come on, sit here. Don't say anything. Quiet. Look, don't step out of this room. And don't roam around either. OK? Just sit in one place. Is my Mom here, too? Please, promise me you won't leave this room. Promise. I won't lie to you, Saanvi. Often in life, we face situations where... one has to grow up very fast. Something happened to me as well... and now you're in a similar situation. But don't be scared. Don't be scared at all. OK? You're a strong girl. Now, listen to me carefully. Look at this door. You will only open this door for me or Sirohi sir and no one else. - Understood? - Yes, ma'am. The country needs brave girls like you. Honestly. But my father wanted a son. He always said that girls are not wise enough to run this world. But I am. What is this? Bhunnu Uncle thought I didn't see him slip this in my bag. The bomb that went off outside the tunnel... that was my father and Bhunnu. Can you arrest them? Please, keep it safe with you. Is it evidence? It will come in handy at the right time. And remember... you only open this door... For you and Sirohi uncle. Stay safe. Stay quiet. Vikram... we had an understanding, didn't we? I thought you were on my team. I am still on your team, ma'am. Then what happened? I don't comply with your order. Well, your compliance never obstructed your duty before. So, why now? Do I have to remind you, Sirohi? Are you OK? - Mom. - Where is she? Sirohi? Sirohi, position. Yes, ma'am. I am with a little kid. She is all alone. I've taken her into my custody. - Kid? She is a witness, Sirohi. - But, ma'am... You know what needs to be done, Sirohi. Hurry up. Look at me, Sirohi. He is hungry. I promised him. I promised him I'd get him something to eat. Tyagi madam's orders are to shoot you both. Tyagi madam's orders are... I promised him I'd get him something to eat. I have to do it. She told me. Do what you came to do... but then you must burn our bodies. Don't let us turn into one of them. Are you... prepared to kill your own people? Yes... if it saves other lives, then yes. I can't lose him. - Aunty made me responsible for him. - I was responsible for my people as well. I follow orders. I received orders... But we... lose our lives. Right? He is my cousin. I love him. Then prove it. Dereliction of duty. That's what they'll say. DC Ahluwalia and you... arrested... disgraced. Is that you want? Save yourself the embarrassment. You were going to be promoted to my rank. Think... how proud your family would be. I thought you were a good soldier, Sirohi. I am a good soldier, ma'am. Prove it. Arrest DC Ahluwalia and bring Saanvi to me. Redeem yourself. Did someone say my name? Ahlu! Lower your gun! Commandant Tyagi, I am placing you under arrest. Under Section 7-15 of the Prevention of Corruption Act... I arrest you. I have evidence as well as witnesses that prove that Surya... Ahlu, mind your tone. - The head of Surya Developers... - Take your hands off her! Mudhalvan and you pretended that this area was infested by insurgents. What? There are no insurgents here, Vikram. No insurgents! This was a big conspiracy, Vikram, so the Baaz Squad could be misled into relocating the people living here. These fuckers used us as pawns to build their highway. They used us for their own petty benefits! - Using patriotism and duty as excuses. - Ahlu, please... They kept lying to us! All this is for nothing, Vikram! For absolutely nothing! Gun down. Move the gun! I said, "Gun down!" We should restrain her and take command. That would be mutiny. I don't care. I don't care if it's mutiny! Fuck! Man the door! Fuck! Saanvi... It's me, child. Come on, you motherfuckers. That's for Jalianwala Bagh. That's for Bhagat Singh, motherfuckers! Keep firing. Saanvi? - Who is it? - It's me, Saanvi. Open the door, child. I want to check if you're OK. Open the door. I can't let anyone in until daybreak. - It's not safe. - Open the door, Saanvi. I said open the door! Motherfuckers! She escaped! This is all your fault! She is our commanding officer! Push! Sir, there are too many of these bastards. It's taking a lot of bullets to kill one. You think... you're safe in there? She... has always been stubborn, like her mother. I can see that. She will listen to her father, but first, I want to discuss something... with Colonel Lynedoch. Name your terms. This door will break! Let me do something. I had to crawl from the bottom to where I am. Fought against my destiny and dragged myself this far. I've left death and destruction in my wake and I am not sorry. I cannot throw it all away... for a small setback. If you promise... to share your powers with me... as well as your position, then I promise... I'll get you that one thing you need the most... my child... Saanvi. You can take her. I am ready to sacrifice her. I'll give you whatever you want. Just give me your power. You have a deal. - Get the grenades! Quickly! - Grenades? - Ahlu! - Have you gone mad? You will blow up the entire door. Don't worry. Do it now! Down! Saanvi? It's your father. - Father? - I want to come inside and stay with you. I cannot open the door, Father. No need to be scared of your dad, Saanvi. I am sorry I yelled at you. No need to be scared of your dad. You're a liar, Father! You only think about yourself. You only love yourself and no one else! You don't care that they shot mother! You are an evil man! And for your own selfish reasons, you won't spare anyone! I feel sad you're my father! You never wanted me as a daughter and I don't want you as a father! I hate you, Father! I hate you! Give me some time and I'll prove how useful I am. Saanvi, open the door, quickly! Saanvi! Open the door! Saanvi! Let's find Tyagi's location and arrest her, quick! Ahlu, I won't believe a word you said about Tyagi ma'am. Vikram... We can't be that stupid to not find out after all this time. The IED blast... was done by us. Do you want me to believe this guy who shifts his loyalty conveniently? Please, believe me, Vikram. Where is the evidence you talked about? In the armory. Motherfuckers. You said you would help me. Yes. Cousin... help me, cousin. I don't want to die out here. What am I going to tell Aunty? I don't want to die out here. Your cousin needs you. Please, don't do it. Your cousin needs your help. Please, don't do it. Don't listen to her. Cousin, please, don't listen to her. Don't do it. It's me, Haq. It's all a lie. Don't be fooled. No. Cousin, look into my eyes. It's me, Haq. Haq... your little cousin. My cousin is dead. What are they waiting for outside? Why don't they just attack us and get it over with? Vikram, Mudhalvan is at the rear exit. Hurry up! Stop him! Asshole. Trying to escape? Movement... in the trees. They are moving forward. Fuck. Musket troops. They are about to fire! Take cover! Ahlu? Ahlu, can you hear me? Sirohi, come in. Come quickly to the monitor. Sirohi, listen to this. This is for you. Watch. My friend wants to know the truth about the Campa Jungles. We all want to know. Why are we here? This area is unsafe, right? Swarming with insurgents, terrorist outfits. How much did you offer Tyagi to do your dirty work? - Tell him! - Come here. Money. More than a year's salary. Take it. How dare you... What do you Baaz Squad think of yourselves? Don't be crazy. Do you really think you run this country? Money runs the country. The country doesn't run on ideologies - it runs on money. Fuck. You don't know real sacrifice. Ahlu! No! Choke on me, motherfuckers! Sir, we must get out of here! Sir, they are coming inside! Move to the armory. They have infiltrated the building. I repeat. Move back and towards the armory. The dead won't die. Bloody motherfuckers! Let's go! Let's go! Get out of here, sir! Go! Kaushal! Mom, is that you? Saanvi... Saanvi... Saanvi... Saanvi... Hands up! Up! Move right! Right! Down! Saanvi! Saanvi? Open the door. - It's Sirohi. - Sirohi, is that you? Saanvi. Saanvi. Saanvi! Open the door! It's Sirohi speaking! Bhunnu, close the gate! It's me, Sirohi! Open the door, child! Saanvi, open the door! Don't trust him. Saanvi, keep the door closed. But, Mom, Ahluwalia ma'am said that Vikram uncle... Vikram uncle is evil. Everyone out there is evil. Whoever is in there is not your mom. Mom, is that really you? Yes, my child, it's me. They are breaking down the gates! Saanvi! Bhunnu! Open the door! Saanvi, open the door, child. Whoever is in there is not your mom. But she sounds like my mom. My child, I'm with you. Your dad's gone, too. It's just us now. Isn't this what you wanted? Just the two of us always together. Don't let them in. Don't let them in. Don't let them in. Don't let them in. Don't let them in. Fucker. Don't let him come in. - Saanvi... - Mom? Saanvi! Saanvi! Faster!
