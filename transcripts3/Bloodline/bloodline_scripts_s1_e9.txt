 Preaching to the choir. Good luck to you. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Hey, man. We're all out. We're getting a shipment tomorrow morning. What time you open? - Five-thirty. - Five-thirty? Yeah? That's good. All right. Thank you. - Yeah. No problem. - Yeah. Take a look at this. - Oh. They-- - Does that pass inspection? They're really nice. Looks like dinner to me. - See you later, honey. - Bye, Mom. Good catch, Joe. Yeah, Joe. Good catch. Guy who owns the bait shop is Wayne Lowry. He's got a record.

 Why don't we get Loo to authorize a surveillance team? There's only one empty desk at the moment, but whatever you need, be my guest. - Excuse me. Lieutenant? - Someone already beat us to it. Hey, lieutenant. What's Grunwald doing here? DEA needs some office space. - What for? - They're the Feds. Think they fucking tell me anything? Clay. Hey. John Rayburn. We met at the regional commission. - Yeah. Good to see you again. - Yeah. I think we saw each other this morning. At the bait shop. You wouldn't be looking into Wayne Lowry by any chance, would you? Is there someplace we can talk? Yeah. You want a cup of coffee? - No. I'm good. - Come on in. DEA's building a case against Lowry. Big distributor down here. - He's the top of the pyramid? - May not be King Tut, but we flip him and dominoes fall. I think he's doing more than dealing drugs. I think he's good for being involved in these murders. As far as we know, he moves drugs, not people. Why is it he can be involved in one and not the other? I'd let you talk to the guy once we bring him in. I got two dead girls. I think this guy's involved in it. This shit's paper thin. You know it. - I hate to be the guy to take your case-- - Then don't do that. - Sometimes I gotta hate myself. - I'm not stepping away from this. - Guess who the Fed is? - That's the way you're gonna play this? - Stay out of my case. - Fuck you. How about I introduce you to Vicente Cruz, huh? Who the fuck is that? This girl's father, that's who. Oh, but I don't wanna fuck with your case, Clay. You go have a sunshiny day. All right. - What do you want? - You share. I share. What the fuck's wrong with that? We had Lowry using a dock in Key Largo. Then the shipments stopped. So now we're trying to locate the new point of entry. So locally, who are you looking at? Couple of scumbags. Maybe you've seen them. - Name's Rafi Quintana. - Works for Lowry. Victim's father lD'd him as accepting money for human trafficking. How about this guy? - You know him? - That's Eric O'Bannon. We don't make him out to be anything more than a low-level runner. That's about right. He's on parole. We should be able to rattle his cage. Do you know any of his associates? How's the charter business going? It's how I'm making the big bucks. What about you? How are things going? Hey. You call that girl? Oh, yeah, I did. I just got back from being over at her place. I'm leaving Diana and the kids. Yeah. Imagine that, man. You out on your own. Yeah. How's everything else going? Yeah, it's good. Pretty good. Hey, are you seeing Chelsea O'Bannon? Here and there. Why? No, nothing. I always liked her. She's always had shit for luck in life, like the rest of that family. That's great. That's great. How's Eric doing? Yeah, I'm not sure, man. Haven't seen him around for a while. Well. No, it's good. Chelsea. Glad you got somebody. That's good. I wanna talk to you about Diana real quick. - Shit. ls everything okay? - She was upset about the other night. What? You take one fucking night off, she gets a bug in her ass about it? No, she wasn't upset with me. She was upset with you. - Did she say why? - No, just said that you were acting... aggressive. She said she asked you to leave the house. You wouldn't leave. No, I don't think so. Come on, man. Diana doesn't lie. She doesn't make shit up. You were drinking. Maybe you did something you don't remember doing, but if she says you're acting weird, you were acting weird. I'm asking if you would, watch what you say around her. Keep the peace for me. Please. I just thought we were having a little bit of fun but-- I mean, now that you mention it, I guess must've been something happened... so I'm sorry. I'll try to be more respectful in the future. Thanks. - Do you need help with any of this stuff? - Yeah. I can't. I gotta get back to the house. - Throw that stuff in the back. - I love you. Take care. Thank you. I love you, brother. Fuck. You just eat awfully fast for someone who enjoys food as much as you do. Must be genetic. Your dad did the same thing. Oh, that's what we have in common. I knew there had to be something. You know, I like the way you prepare this better. Yeah, I do it in parchment. Keeps the moisture in. Most places around here are not that-- You know. They're shitty, Mom. Well, still, it's nice to get out of the house for a change. Hey. What do you think about maybe expanding the dining service? Expand it how? Offering food to locals. To vacationers that aren't staying at the inn. To anybody who wants a beautiful meal by the sea. Honey, didn't your father say no to that idea years ago? Just thought...now you have a say, you might look at it differently. I've always had a say. Okay. Will you think about it? I've already let you change the menu. I'm just trying to help. I'm trying to do the things that I'm best at. That's all. I'm trying to contribute the best way I can. No more business talk tonight, okay? I'm having dinner with my son. - Hello. - Rayburn, amigo. - Yeah. It's me. - You alone? Yes. That's correct. - You good to go? - Absolutely. Absolutely. - Today. - You got it. No problem. Watch your step, folks. The AC's on and running so make yourselves comfortable. We got an hour ride to Miami International. Hey, Carlos. This bag's gotta go too. Gas her up on the way back. Mile marker 94. - Sure thing, boss. - Pump number two. Hello? Mama Ray? - Hello? - In here. - Hey. - Hey, there. Come over here. I wanna show you something. - What are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? Biology class? I'm filleting. - You know anything about cooking? - I suck at cooking. No, you don't. No one's ever taught you. That's all that means. Didn't you go to cooking school? Yeah. I did. And your mom and your dad helped to pay for it. I tried making a pie once, actually, and it kind of tasted like a brick. Well, okay. That's baking. It's more like science, you know, whereas cooking is all about feel. Intuition. But you do have to have some technique. For instance. I'm sure you've had fish. You've been eating, and all of a sudden, you've got a bone stuck in your mouth. Yeah. It's gross. Well, that's someone being fucking lazy in preparation. Let me show you how this is done. With the mahi, you fucking peel this off, just like a banana. Look at that. And that's what we're left with. - There's some biology. - Yeah. Look at that, though. That's beautiful. Mom. - Hey, honey. - Are you serious? - Bridal magazines? - What? You can't wait five minutes before you start planning this thing? Someone left this in Bungalow 4, and I'm just looking at it. They did not. Will you please just let me enjoy this? I'm excited. Okay. Let me see. Believe me. I'm glad you wanna help. Planning is the worst part. Meg. It'll be fun, honey. Your father would be so happy. Yeah. I know. I just wish we could do it quickly. Let's knock it out next week. Oh, for heaven's sakes. Well, I'm having fun. - Good. - You know, I keep seeing Marco and your brothers wearing seersucker suits. What do you think? I actually like it. And Danny could do the menu. - Maybe. - He's showing interest in that again. I saw in the invoices that the food deliveries are up. Yep. He's changing the menu. He wants to open the restaurant to the public. Why are we making changes? Why not? Because there's no need. You're fixing something that isn't broken. Dad always talked about consistency here. Yeah. I know. I'm not even sure that it works financially. I should go over it carefully with the accountants. Of course. You should do that. But I think that if we can make it work business-wise... I don't wanna stand in Danny's way, really. Sure. Danny's a big part of the future here. And I value his opinion. Of course. There's a bone in here. Put it to the side. That's lazy technique. Excuse me? Danny taught me how to fillet a fish. When was that? Earlier when I went over to see Mama Ray. He's been giving you cooking lessons? What's the problem? Nothing. I'm just surprised. Why? You guys sent him to cooking school, didn't you? Gotta go. Maybe just once that kid can come to the front door and knock instead of honking that damn horn. No one does that anymore. Honey. - Say goodbye properly. - Bye. - Love you. - Hey, hey, hey. Goodbye. I love you too. - What's with the attitude? - She's a teenager. She's hanging out with Danny? He taught her how to fillet fish. I don't think that's considered hanging out. We talked about this. I'm not comfortable with it. - I talked to him. - Yeah? What did he say? He gets it. He gets it. Whatever happened with that cooking school? I don't know. We lent him some money. We know he's not gonna pay us back. Okay. I don't care about the money. I'm wondering if he ever got a job cooking anything. I don't know. I don't know. - Never mentioned it to you? - No. If he did have a job, he probably fucked up. Why would he mention it? Do you want more wine? It's good wine. The fish was very good tonight. You got it, Dave. See you next year. Hey, Lily. Can you give these a clean-up and a good drink? This one's got dead leaves on it. - Hey, Danny. - Growing heirlooms this year? Yeah. Just started. Hey, you got a moment? Sure. Look, I just... I just wanna apologize for my behavior the other night. - Don't worry about it. - John and I were very drunk. I'm not exactly sure what I said, but I'm sure I was loud - and probably stayed too long, you know. - That's fine. It's fine. You sure? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Hey, thanks. You know, for coming to apologize in person. I believe if you got something to say, come right out, say it. Me too. Direct is best, you know? Which is why if you do have a problem with me again, just come tell me about it, you know? I will. Just say it to my face. Don't fucking come between me and my brother. Not a good idea. - Hey. - Hey. - You good? - Yeah. Is it just you? Yeah. Yeah. Kids are out. Whoa, babe. That's a generous pour. Three fingers? It was five a little while ago. How was your day? Oh, my day was interesting. - Yeah? - Yeah. Danny came by. Oh. yeah? To apologize. That's a good thing. Not the way he does it. And I called the cooking school. He went for half a semester and then left. So I don't know what the fuck we paid for. You called. It was two years ago. Don't you wanna know what he's been doing since then? Hey. Morning, Joe. I brought a special shipment for you today. Only the best. See you, Joe. Thank you. Danny, you fucking idiot. Who the fuck is Beth Mackey? "Viva Caputa Restaurant, Miami." Yeah. Come in. You been talking to Mom? Yeah. I talk to Mom all the time. Do you have a problem with my plans? Well, she asked me to weigh in. Maybe I haven't been clear, because I don't need you weighing in. Okay? I don't need you putting ideas in Mom's head. I hardly think I'm the person putting ideas in her head. This may sting a little bit. But, you know, we're done with the way Dad did things. It's done. Maybe before you change things, you should be here longer than a few weeks. Well, you see. There you go again. You're bringing conflict into the situation. I mean, everything's fine. Mom's happy. I'm happy. I have an opinion. If it doesn't agree with your plan, I can't help it. You're gonna have to deal. Look. Look. Look at me. Look at me. - Please. This is my future. - It's my future too. It's Kevin's and it's John's. It's all of ours. This place belongs to all of us. When you went to law school, Morn and Dad paid for it, right? When I went to cooking school, who fucking paid for it? Did Mom and Dad pay for it? No, they didn't. I had to fucking put my hand out and fucking beg people. I did go to law school. And then I came back. And I stayed here. I turned down opportunities so that I could help Mom and Dad. Because you're such a good daughter, right? You're such a fucking liar. Please leave. I have a lot of work to do. Yeah. I'll go. But I can go a lot further. Rayburn! - Get the fuck out of my-- - You went too far. - Get out of here. - You fucked up my car. I know you did it. - You don't know shit. - I'm filing a restraining order. I'm filing a restraining order against you. You're not getting away. You take one step-- You take one more step onto our property, you're going to jail. Hey, next time you wanna come after me, have the balls to do it yourself, you fucking asshole. Fuck. Hey. You a real estate agent? I was looking to talk to someone about the restaurant. Oh, the place has been empty for months now. - Do you know what happened? - I heard something about a kitchen fire. Hey, maybe you can help me. I'm trying to find a guy that used to work here. You recognize him? Oh, shit. Yeah. This was his place. What do you mean, his place? He owned it? I don't know who owned it, but he ran it. I mean, you know, I think he was the head chef? - You sure about that? - Yeah. I work right there. I saw him every day. He was a nice guy. It's too bad what happened with the fire. This place was starting to take off. Excuse me. John Rayburn. - It's Beth Mackey. - Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate it. - Yeah. Thanks for getting back to me. - Does tomorrow morning work? Remember when we were talking about bringing Danny back into the business? Yeah. I told you I was fine with it. John keeps saying stuff about the past, about everything Danny had been through. What does he mean? Sarah. - That's it? - "That's it?" Meg, Danny killed our sister. - He did not kill her. - Well, he may as well have. You're the lawyer. What do you call that? Negligent? Whatever. Homicide? I don't know. I just felt like there was more to it. You mean what happened after. I don't know. That's why I'm asking. Why? What happened after? - You really don't remember this? - No, I was 7 years old. - Yeah. - I remember Sarah drowned. - And I remember Dad was devastated. - Yeah. - Then Danny got hurt. - Right. His shoulder. He got hit by a car. Yeah, well, that was the story. He didn't get hit by a car? Then what happened to him? Like you said... Dad was devastated. Dad did that to him? Jesus. - No one ever told rne that. - You were there. We both were. We were sitting right here in this kitchen. John was here. Dad came home from the hospital. They ran through here, chased Danny down to the beach. We watched it right through that window. - So we all lied to a police officer? - I don't call it lying. Dad just lost a child. He was angry. I don't blame him. Who told us to lie? I don't... I don't know. Somehow we all just knew. That was the story. - You saw the car hit your brother? - Yes, sir. I never saw someone get hurt that bad. Will you ask Meg to come in? Are you nervous? - No. - Good. There's no reason to be nervous. These are simple questions, okay? I wanna ask about your brother Danny. He killed my sister. Yes. I know about that. But I'm interested in how your brother Danny hurt his shoulder. You know anything about that? - A car hit him. - Did you see that? No. Then how do you know? My brother told me. - Which brother? - John. - Beth Mackey? - Yeah. John Rayburn. You guys don't look anything alike. Oh, we take after different sides of the family. How do I know you're his brother? Yeah. How's that? John Rayburn. Yeah, he talked about you. Cop brother. - You mind if I ask you a few questions? - Why? ls Danny in trouble? - Not that I know of. - You trying to get him in trouble? No. I'm concerned about him. I was thinking maybe since you called me back, you were concerned about him too. I'm wondering if maybe I could ask you a few questions, please. I'd like to know more about my brother. My mom's English is not perfect. So when Meg mentioned the groomsmen in seersucker-- She thought that I was talking about a prostitute. - Oh, no. - Hey, Mama. We're gonna step out. Oh, you have someone with you? - Chelsea. Hey, honey. How are you? - Hi, Mrs. Rayburn. - I'm well, thanks. - Good to see you. - Hey, Meg. - Hey. How are you? Hey. You two come join us. Grab a chair. Yeah, sure. Why not? One quick drink. Marco, you're about to be a married man. You can't be flirting like that. - It's called being a gentleman. - Oh, is that what it is? Yeah. I gotta work on that a little bit. I gotta say, I'm a little bit intimidated by this guy. Look at you, man. Hey, hey, hey- I can't believe I'm gonna be related to this guy. - I mean, he's a good-looking guy, right? - Yeah, he is. Hey. Look at poor Chelsea here, you know? She's stuck with me. Oh, maybe you can give her some tips. Let her know how to pull down the big game. - Dumb luck. - Yeah. Only thing I know about romance is you gotta be mysterious. You gotta have some secrets. - Right? - Are you keeping secrets from me? Oh, baby, I got a million of them. A million of them. What about my sister? She got any secrets? I wouldn't know, would I? I mean, it's a secret, right? You know what? That's the best part about being with a cop. - Can't get anything past him. - Oh, don't believe her. I'm sure she's got a few secrets. Oh, will you stop picking on your sister? - We all have secrets. - Yeah. Might have to do some cop work. Shine a light. There they are. Oh, how rude of me. You guys don't have glasses. I'll get them, Mama. Thanks, honey. So how've you been? - I'm pretty good. - Sorry about that. I can't believe I forgot-- We're sitting here with our drinks and... Hey. This ends now. Okay. What are we talking about? That little fucking game that you're playing outside. So you're not having fun anymore? What is it? You think you have something on me? You think you can manipulate me because I cheated on my boyfriend? Your fiancÃ© now. Now he's your fiancÃ©. It's over. The game's over. Do you understand me? Maybe it's not a game. Go tell him. He's sitting out there. Go tell him. - I don't think now's an appropriate time. - Oh, really? I think it's a perfect time. What a fucking thrill for you to humiliate me in front of Mom. Why would I wanna do that? No, you're right. You're right. You wanna keep it and hang it over my head until the next time you want something? ls that what it is? Fuck that, Danny. Go tell him. Or do you want me to do it? Because I fucking will. I don't care. I'm not gonna live in fear of you. Okay. Does this mean that I'm not gonna be doing the catering for the wedding? I know you bailed him out of jail, but how did he end up in jail? He owed a lot of money. So he stole painkillers from a pharmacy. He got caught selling them. Do you know who he owed the money to? The kind of guys that get it back, or you get hurt. - So you know about the restaurant. - That's what he borrowed the money for. I understand there was a fire. Danny said someone torched the place. Did he say who? He had some partners. Guys he borrowed from. Your brother didn't get any of the insurance money, if that's what you think. No. He must have taken it hard, losing the restaurant. Yeah. He did. Went on a bender. Coke. Vodka. More coke. Then he got weird. Weird? How? Speaking to people who weren't there. I heard him talking to some chick in the bathroom once. Kept calling her Sarah. When I walked in, he was alone. Sarah. When's the last time you talked to Danny? Couple months ago maybe. Guys keep showing up here looking for him. Looking for what? Their money. They keep coming by, asking for him. - Until recently. - Maybe he paid them back. I seriously doubt that. You know, if you see him, would you tell him that... Whatever. I still drive by his apartment sometimes, wondering if he's gonna turn up. What apartment? This is your brother's place here. I haven't seen the guy in weeks. His mail was piling up in his box. That's the only reason I ever come here. Look, I don't want any trouble, detective. I got it from here. All right. Well, if you need anything else, just holler. - May l join you? - I didn't know you were home. Yeah. Come on. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's beautiful. Are you gonna finish rolling that joint or should I? Busted. Oh, you busted me cold, Mom. You busted me cold. I haven't done this since I was a kid. Your father did not approve. You know, for all his libertarian ways, he was a bit of a stick in the mud. Yeah. The stick was stuck somewhere anyway. I was fun once. Even a little wild. Back in high school, every weekend my girlfriends and I would hang out near the Navy base. We were about 17, so we had to take turns finding a sailor to buy us liquor. No. That's how you met Dad? I thought Aunt Charlotte introduced you. That's the story that your father liked to tell. I'd sneak out of the house, me and my girlfriends, and we'd hitchhike all the way to the east side of town to this bar called Ruby's. Must have been my turn to find a sailor. I remember looking around the room and there he was. In uniform. Those killer blue eyes. He was... He was beautiful. And very, very persuasive. We spent the night together in the back of his pickup. Oh, you mean my pickup? Yeah? Yeah. Behind a parking lot. And I think we saw each other every day for the next month. And he got transferred down here. And you followed him down. Yeah. One day he called. He said he'd bought some land and... Why don't I come down and marry him? Just like that? Yeah. I didn't even tell my parents. I just packed my bags and got on a bus. - Weren't you worried? - I was terrified. I think I cried the whole way down. Yeah. That's what you do. What do you mean? When you feel you have no choice, so you... You run away. Yeah. Yeah. I guess you do. Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Really? Hello, officer. Get out of the car. The handle doesn't work. - What'd I do wrong, officer? - Move to the front. Move to the front. Turn around. Put your hands on the hood. What this time? Spread them. Let's talk about Danny.
