 Here ya go, put this on! Polly... there you go, sweetie. Rain gear? Hop Pop, we're frogs. We should actually be taking off our clothes. Woo hoo! Keep your pants on, boy. This here ain't no ordinary rainstorm. We gotta cover up the crops before they're destroyed! It'll be hours of back-breaking work in the mud and the muck. Thankless, hard, character-building labor, Whoa, Anne. Everything all right? No. I think I'm... sick. Hmm. No slimy coating. Well, that's good. - Ah... - Great grubs, your tongue has shrunken

 to an unnaturally tiny size! Stop it! I've got human stuff going on that you don't know anything about... Oh no. Sounds like I've got a bad case of the... mocha lattes! That sounds horrible! Come on, kids. Let's stay away from Anne and her illness. Rest up, Anne. We'll handle the work today. - Feel better, Anne! - Rest up! I'll try my best. Bye. You done did it again, girl! Woo! Whoa! Yeah! Cynthia, my abs... they've been... ab-ducted. Ab-Snatchers II. Best... decision... ever! Oh. You're back? I hope you got along without... Whoa, are you guys okay? Oh, me? I'm fine. Looks like Polly and I have come down with something, too. Who said that? It was brutal out there, Anne. Good thing you stayed inside. I mean, sure, the work would have gone much quicker if you were with us, but you probably just would have gotten sicker. Yep. sicker. But nobody has to worry, because I'm going to take care of everyone... Ah, ah... - Oh, no! - Yep, it got Sprig, too. Wait, what? So you're all sick? Sure looks that way. Polly, no. Oh, dang. I'm sticky. Who's gonna take care of us? Me. I'm gonna take care of you guys. - But, Anne, you're sick too. - Ah! Sure am, buddy. But you're all way more important to me. Thanks, Anne. Wow, that's uncharacteristically generous of you. Aw, you know, I do what I can. Now let's get you all better! Kill me. Ah, it's in my mouth! Sorry, Anne. Ah, sweet relief. Give me that! Oh... Hmm. Finally, my famous broccoli kale super soup. Now, with cricket! Oh, this one's a kicker. Oh, I almost forgot. Sprig's favorite. Mushrooms. Ew, smells awful. Eh, probably a good thing. Soup's on! So... feeling any better? No. Eh. Oh, man. I thought that would've helped for sure. Uh, Hop Pop, are your legs normally that red? This can't be good. Yep, it's red leg, all right. Is that a bad thing? Uh, yeah, Anne. The red leg works its way up your body, and when it finally covers you completely, you... you... You depart from this ungrateful world. What? It's okay, kids. Just pick a corner for me to pass away in. That one'll do! No, we are not picking a corner. There's gotta be something we can do to fix this. There has to be. The guide book says red leg can be cured by wading in a mineral pond high in the mountains. Mountains? Ha! The journey alone would do me in. Nope, nope, nope. I'm just gonna get ready for the hereafter in my corner. Hey, stop it! Sorry, Hop Pop, but you are going to live to see another day. I am gonna take you to that mineral pond. Yay! Uh, even though I'm still pretty sick. Dang it, boy! Hiyah! Come on, Bessie! How you doing back there, Hop Pop? Just fine, considering the red is up to my stomach. What? It's spreading quicker than we thought. Knock it off, boy! Just find a nice tree to leave me under. Better make that a tree for two. Polly, too? I have to get this cart moving faster. Anne, what are you doing? If Bessie can't get you there, then I'll get you there myself! Ow, ow... Whoa! Yeah! How... much... further? We just have to cross this plateau. We have to cross that? I'll never get the cart to the other side. Sure you can... Well, not now, of course. There's no shame in failure, Anne. - Just pick a nice rock... - No! No rock, no tree. We are going to that mineral pond. Okay, okay. Watch the timing, Anne... Yeah! I knew you'd get us here. And it's a good thing, too. Sprig! You too? Come on, let's get to that spring. Right around the... Wait. These are stairs? I can't walk up these. Ain't for walking. They're for hopping. The stairs are made for frogs. Well, we tried. Hang on, everyone. Anne, what are you doing? Ah! We gotta jump for it! Yay, we made it! - You saved us! - You did it, Anne! I knew you guys would be okay. Thank goodness, too, because... Wait. Shouldn't the red be going away? - In theory. - Sprig, what does the book say? The pond should cure us instantly. It's... not working. What? The book was wrong? Books are wrong all the time. A lot more than you'd think. Dang it, boy! This is all my fault. No, Anne. You did more than anyone could've asked of you. Yeah, you're the best. Even though you're as sick as we are, you still tried to save us. You're... a hero. But... but... but I'm not sick! What? I never was. I faked it so I could take a day off. I swear, as long as I live, never to fake being sick again. Don't be ridiculous, kiddo. You might've just gotten sick with the rest of us. Yeah, we'd probably all be dying now. At least someone made it. You guys are the best. That's enough, now. It's time to let us go. - No! - Goodbye, Anne. No! Rest in peace, you beautiful frogs. Uh, anyone dead, yet? Not yet! Present. Hmm. That's odd. Unless... Sprig, get over here and show me that book. Hmm, it says here red leg isn't the only thing that can cause a frog to turn red. - What? - Yeah. It says there's a mushroom that gives you the exact same symptom. But we didn't eat any mushrooms. Sprig, turn around! Okay. That mushroom was in the kitchen. I put it in the soup I gave you! That mushroom ain't for eating, Anne. I use it to scrub the pots and wash the bathroom floors, and... clean Bessie's stable. Looks like we were just normal sick. Uh, Anne? - You're gonna live! - Is she gonna stop? Just let it happen, kids. Just let it happen. *AMPHIBIA* Episode : "Family Shrub" Sync corrections by srjanapala You know, Hop Pop, back home we call this a family tree. That's 'cause everyone in your world is crazy. Now, where was I? Hmm. Oh, yes, Great Aunt Gertrude. She was a masterful dirt tiller. - I mean, how cool is that? - Eh. Oh, and you can't forget second cousin Alfred. He was the king! A king? Yeah! The king of single-tiered irrigation systems. Yep, you lost me. Our ancestors were boring! Were they really all just farm frogs? Where are the artists? The poets? The dreamers? Just farm frogs? Kids, the point of the shrub is to give you an appreciation for your past. The Plantar family has layers. You just have to know where to look. Layers, huh? Okay, then. Well, what's so special about her? Polliana? Oh, brace yourselves. She wasn't just any farmer. She was a turnip farmer! Welp, as much as I'd love to help, not gonna find any of my ancestors on your shrub, so... Don't have to be blood to be a Plantar, Anne. No, but you do have to be a master stacker to get to level 46. If I can just... Curse you, sudden death round! Why you so hard? Anne, this is based on nothing at all, but I'm almost certain that game will rot your brain! Uh-oh, looks like we're out of glue! Does that mean we have to stop? Can we do something fun now? No fun till the shrub's done. Just gonna run to the store real quick and get more glue. Be back in a jiffy. Don't go anywhere! Ah! You're lucky you're an outsider, Anne. Our family history is weak. They didn't do anything weird. Or different. Or fun. I mean, look at this. Even this painting's making me feel depressed. What the... Whoa! Sprig! You broke the house. Whoa. Oh, wow. This looks unsafe. We have to go down there. - There could be treasure. - Or dead bodies! Let's do it! Uh, did we just get locked in here? No, no, no. Let us out! Help! Wait! Come on, let's just find another way out, you babies. Whoa. All this was under your house? Oh, there's dust everywhere. This place is amazing. Whoa! Oh, what this? Wow! Hey, why do you think the entrance was hidden like that? To keep it a secret, obviously. Who wouldn't want to steal this stuff? Uh, me, me. I don't wanna steal this stuff. It says here this place belonged to Great Uncle Skip Plantar. He was a farmer and a brilliant scientist! He experimented with all kinds of stuff. This is wild. I wanna know more! Like, what does this do? - Whoa... - Whoa, mama. Maybe it's harmless. My, my, so many glues to choose from. This is gonna be a little difficult. Hey, Hopadiah! What brings you here? Oh, hey, Loggle. Just trying to find some glue to put my family shrub together. Oh, Hop Pop. All you need for that is this. Dang it, you're right. In the end, it's all about love. What? No, I meant you need this. Nothing stronger. This stuff will fix your shrub. Heck, it'll fix your house! Hmm. Intriguing. Yet another choice. Looks like my day just got a lot more challenging. - What do we do? - This abomination must be destroyed. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute. There may be another way. Dude, what are you doing? Yeah, that pumpkin will squash you. There, there. Easy does it. There, there, you beautiful, disgusting thing. - What is happening? - That's right, Mama Sprig is here. Oh, you horrible, horrible, sweet boy. Forgive me. Dude... that was ice cold. Love is the cruelest weapon. Agreed. Now let's get out of here before something else happens. You guys okay? More or less. Yeah... ow. Oh, cool, our lantern. Whoa. This is heaven. This is the same Polliana from Hop Pop's shrub. She wasn't just a turnip farmer. She was a turnt up warrior. Hey, check it out. I found her diary. The Bogwater Wars of '48. The Western Toad invasion of '53. Man, she was in a lot of battles. She was the coolest, most terrifying Plantar ever. - Like me! - Wow, we sure are learning a lot. I'd like to learn more. Like, hey, what does this do? Ah! Will you please stop pulling levers? Levers are for pulling, Anne! Why is there a death trap here, anyways? Says here this is Polliana's training simulator. Look out! Okay, how do we turn it off? The shut off switch is by the exit on the other side. Okay, we can do this. We just gotta go very slowly... Polly! Hiyah! Well, That was intense. So, you guys wanna do it again? - Nope, nope, nope, nope. - Nope, nope, nope, nope. You know what? I'll just buy all of them. You can never have too much glue, I always say. Good choice! Glue! Everywhere! Need water! Hop Pop, no! That's more glue. Loggle! Help me! No. No! - Whoa. - Oh, wow. Can you believe it? Another mysterious hidden chamber. Oh, cool! This place is filled with games and puzzles. Let's see if we can find which Plantar this stuff belonged to. No way. Emma the Newt? Honorary Plantar? Hey, check this out. She travelled all over the place, collected all this cool stuff, and settled with the Plantars. She wasn't even a frog. Wow, so cool. I guess even an outsider like me can be a Plantar. Oh, Anne. Looks like you've solved the puzzle... of your own heart. Wow, thanks buddy. No, thank you, buddy. Hey! How about we solve the puzzle of getting the heck out of here! - Oh, we think the exit is that way. - Oh. Well, it's locked. - Hmm. - Maybe I can smash it. Hiyah! - Well, that didn't work. - We're gonna die down here! Wait a second. Guys, this isn't just a door. It's a puzzle! All right, let's do this. There, I did it! Anne, what did you do? Oh, no! I know what this is. It's the sudden death round. You can do this, Anne. Anne, no pressure, but we're gonna die. Almost... there. Woo hoo! I did it! Take that, Hop Pop. Who's brain is rotten now, sucker? We had your family history all wrong, guys. The Plantars weren't just farmers. Nope, they were twisted. Yeah, they were pretty cool. Now, can we finally find a way out of here? Yeah, and I think I know how. - Nope, nope, nope. - Nope, nope, nope. Hop Pop! We found those Plantar family layers you were talking about. Eh? Found them? Kids, I wasn't being literal. Oh, Hop Pop! There was a moving fireplace. - Secret rooms! - Crazy science lab. - Family heirlooms! - Turnip with a face. - Family's amazing! - Actually proud to be a Plantar. Games don't rot your brain! Secret rooms? Full of Plantar family heirlooms? Why, this is incredible! And most importantly, once again, I was right. Our ancestors were the most amazing scientist, warrior, farmers ever! Everyone needs to know. Well I want to see these rooms, too! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on there, Hop Pop. They're full or traps and super hard but satisfying puzzles. Oh, and there was a pumpkin abomination! A real affront to nature. I loved it! And then betrayed it. No offense, but I'm not sure you could handle it. You have no idea what I can or can't handle. What do you say, Loggle? Up for another adventure? Absolutely... not! Hop Pop, no! Should we go help them? Help! Yeah, probably. Oh, oh, oh! Let's adopt that pumpkin monster.
