 They'll blow us both up if we try. What about that box that Slink carries around, - can you mess with that? - Yeah, in theory. The race takes us within 30 miles of that asylum. You up for a detour, Barbie? Hell yeah. _ __ [The Archies' "Sugar, Sugar"] ♪ ♪ ♪ Sugar ♪ ♪ Ah, honey, honey ♪ ♪ You are my candy girl ♪ Male announcer: In the middle of a hard day's work...

Nobody ever ditches the Mayhem Party. Just gotta make sure we're back for the race. I think this is the first time I've ever seen you happy. How could I not be? Finally getting my sister back. And then what? She gonna finish the race with us? I don't know. I haven't thought that far ahead, okay? But we can't remove these brain bombs, and I still need the prize money to take care of her. Oh, but don't you even think of putting that conspiracy theory shit inside her head. I wanna bring down Heart, but people are more important. I promise, Karma comes first. [somber music] Of course, none of that really matters if ours heads are gonna explode. Well, I guess there's only one way to figure out if The Scholar lied to us. [engine roars] [gears whirring] ♪ Hold still, or it won't hurt enough. Ahh... [drill whirring, crunching] ♪ [chuckles] Hand me that, you imbecile.

Heart Enterprises is already harvesting homeless people for their blood. What could they want with a mental hospital? I don't know; that's why we gotta make this quick. Grace, we're just signing her out. It's paperwork. You catch more flies with sugar, you know? Whatever Heart Enterprises wants with her, they're not gonna let her go that easy, and you know it. Which is why it'll go smoother if we let my friends here do the talking. You asked for my help. Do me the courtesy of trying it my way, please. Fine. Okay. But it's honey, not sugar. Dipshit. ♪ [dramatic swell] ♪ ♪ He did the Monster Mash... ♪ Welcome to Kane Hill. Happy Halloween. You know it's June, right? ["Monster Mash" playing] ♪ He did the Mash ♪ ♪ He did the Monster Mash... ♪ Uh, I'm Officer Bailey, and this is my partner... I'm here to find my sister, Karma D'Argento. You can call Dr. Kleinfeld if there's a problem... She was transferred. Okay, you didn't even check to see if... She was transferred. Are you fucking kidding me? Put down the goddamn candy bar... Easy, Grace. Sorry, sir. Can you call Dr. Kleinfeld? I can draw you a map. That sounds great. That works. ♪ [marker scribbling] - Okay, that's it! - Okay, easy, easy, Grace! Your blood sugar's tanking. Uh, I think it's time we get her a muffin. Uh, we'll take it from here. Thanks so much for your help. If you could just buzz us in, that'd be perfecto. [door buzzing] ♪ Ah, ah-ooh... ♪ Your best friend, the cop, has taken a few liberties. If you're still up for a little revenge, I'll grant you a free pass to go after them. I've been wanting to get back at that pig for a while. Just the cop. The girl I want alive. [straining] ♪ [coughs] He's a dead man. Uh, one condition. Caligula gets her own masseuse. She's a little stressed. [dog whimpering] [eerie orchestral music] ♪ This squiggle means right or left? Just forget about the map. Something's off about this place. It's an asylum. What'd you expect?

Good idea. ♪ [serene music] ♪ [birds chirping] ♪ [dramatic music] Must have been some dream. ♪ [sighs] So why am I still restrained? While we have you, we need a few... samples. ♪ Samples for what? ♪ Your bodily fluids tell us the story of who you are. We'll need to harvest them, all of them, should we ever want to reproduce your best features.

What if Lucas calls? - Then you call him back. - Straightaway? - Tomorrow. - He's so sweet. - Of course he is. His name is Lucas. - [chuckles] ♪ [bubbling] ♪ [toilet flushing] Don't look at me like that, Karma. Look, this place is dripping in silicone. It's the only way I'm gonna get the Primo to notice me. You're better than that. Yeah, and we're too broke for me to act like it. I hear the pit crew makes bank. Enough cash where maybe you could go back to school. That would be nice, but it's bullshit. I mean, a race across America? No one can afford the gas. I don't know, but I gotta try. Payday's too big to pass up. ♪ What kind of name is Primo anyway? Primo's not his name. It's the title of the winner, and... I think it's kind of awesome. - [sighs] - Look... I can tell you hate this. - Why don't you just go wait in the car? - No, I'm fine. I'll play along. Thanks. One beer, no drugs, especially not Red. Got it. ♪ Okay, now you've gotta be a big brave little dog while Daddy goes in there, and... cuts up some bacon for your breakfast. Give me some sugar.

Thank the baby Jesus! A cop! They didn't attack you dressed like this? No, we walked right in. What the hell happened here? Good morning, everyone. Happy Halloween! The patients rioted on Halloween. They took over the whole damn place. It was anarchy. And... and now we're the prisoners. Well, there has to be someone in charge. [intercom feedback screeches] [shrill barking] Here, piggy-piggy-piggy. How does it feel to be locked in with violent psychopaths? [alarm blaring] And the only way out of this place... is through me! Shit. They hate it when the emergency lights come on. It makes them violent. Okay, no, no. Stay with me. I'm a cop. It's much safer with me, okay? Yeah, until they kill you. Okay, let's look at the bright side... Do you have any food? I haven't eaten in days. No, but if you help me find my friend, I promise, next roadside diner we find, apple pie's on me. No meat, though. Pie? Deal. But you won't make it 10 feet dressed like that. I'll be the judge of that. [woman screaming] [growls softly] [muffled laughter] So if we're gonna survive... You're gonna have to go native. Dr. Kleinfeld? [ominous music] ♪ [eerie music] [air hissing] ♪ [thumping club music] ♪ ♪ Jean jacket, hands on my hip ♪ ♪ You're pulling me closer ♪ Hey, where do you think you're going? - Uh... [chuckles] Nowhere with you. - Hey, wait, we could have so much fun. - Just... [chuckles] No. Just stop. - Oh, I think you know what I need. Stop. Get away from me. She said no, cocksucker. ♪ - Are you okay? - No, I'm not. ♪ Can we please just go home now? Oh, come on, Primo isn't even here. It's my one chance to meet him. Just give me a couple more hours. That's what you said two hours ago. ♪ Damn it, I'm trying to make sure we get ahead, Karma. By what? Fucking some guy you don't even know? Who says I'm gonna fuck him? I'm your sister. I know you. You'd do anything to get what you want. I love you and shit, but sometimes being your guardian sucks. I'm sorry I'm such a burden to you. Karma, you know that's not what I meant. Why should you have all the fun? Karma? Karma, stop! Karma! ♪ ♪ [club music fades] [indistinct chatter, distant screaming] [eerie music] ♪ Hey, sniff your own ass! He's mine! [yelling] ♪ You do crazy pretty well. [indistinct chatter] You look good. [indistinct chatter, distant screaming] Just keep walking. They killed another one. Another what? Wait. That wasn't paint? This is where the riot came to a head. God-awful slaughtering. They sacrifice another employee every week in remembrance. Well, there was only two patients in there. - I can take them. - And if the other patients come running, we're both dead. You can't do anything for them. They're beyond help, but I'm not. Come on. [whispers] Oh, my God. [eerie music] [indistinct babbling] ♪ Anne, help me. Anne! Anne! Will you stop? You're gonna get us both killed. When was the last time these patients took their meds? This place hasn't been an actual hospital in years. - What do you mean? - Shh! [yelling] [yelling] [cackles] When the government cut mental health funding, we needed money, and Heart Enterprises needed lab rats. - Lab rats for what? - Bad monkey! [whooping] [panting] ♪ Candy? Not just candy... what's in the candy. Heart wanted to reengineer sugar so it wouldn't make people fat, which Smax doesn't. - Only problem is, it... - It makes people insane. ♪ So Smax is basically like a... like an edible form of Red? Not even close. Red makes you feel euphoric, like you're in the womb, but... Smax makes you feel like a hunter. [distant screaming] But the hunt never ends. ♪ Is this the velvet touch you give all your victims? Turn the homeless into pincushions... before you send them to the tubes. I detect disdain in your voice. Heart Enterprises picks up where the government leaves off. We don't just hand out free blankets and food vouchers. We give them a purpose, a drive, a destiny. It's all very symbiotic when you think about it. In return, they get heaven. And by "heaven," you mean you get them so addicted to Red that it's impossible for them to lead normal lives ever again. Define "normal life" to me. Living on the streets, constantly hungry, out in the cold, all alone. Given the choice between that and eternal pleasure, I'd choose pleasure. You deserve all the pleasure in the world. [eerie music] ♪ I don't do drugs. But there are so many different forms of pleasure. ♪ [mechanical whirring] ♪ [groaning] ♪ How was that for you? We're almost halfway there. ♪ Great. I can't wait. Oh, and drink up. It'll make what's coming a lot easier. [bell dings] You want some of this? [panting] Yeah? Now, go over there. And now sit. Wag your tail. Wag it, wag it, wag. Wag your tail! Now lick your balls. Lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em! [monitor beeping] ♪ Oh, my God. Dr. Kleinfeld. It's Grace, Grace D'Argento. Dr. Kleinfeld, you treated my sister, Karma. What the fuck? [panting] Dr. Kleinfeld, come back. - Come back to me. Come back to me! - [groaning] It's Grace. - Grace... - Where's my sister? You gotta save them, Grace. You gotta stop them. Them? Who "them"? Who's them? Who's them... [screams] [defibrillator whirring] Clear! [zapping] [electricity crackling] Clear! [sinister laughter] [monitor flatlines] No! [laughing] [grunting] [groaning] [growling] [grunting] [yelling] [rock music] ♪ [screams] No! ♪ [sharp crunching] [yelling] ♪ [electricity crackling] [screaming] What was that? I don't think I want to know. [yelling] [electricity crackling] ♪ [panting] Clear, motherfucker. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! [patient crying] [ominous music] ♪ [panting] ♪ You find Kleinfeld? Couldn't get much out of him. He's dead. What's with the skin? You checking in here or... - Funny. I... I just... - Yeah, I don't care. Put some pants on. We can't fight like that. - Who's this? - I'm Anne. And I think we should go this way. - I used to work here... - She worked here, so I thought maybe she could help us. Anne, my sister checked in about a year ago, - but I can't find her anywhere. - I'm sorry. - She's gone missing... - I was just a trauma nurse. I didn't deal with any of the admins. - [intercom screeches] - Hey... batshit lunatics. I have a bag of Smax candy bars at reception for the first whackjob that brings me the cop. He's real good-looking. Feel free to change that. [foreboding music] ♪ Got any ideas? - Duck! - ♪ Suit up! ♪ [aggressive techno music] ♪ Suit up! ♪ [beatboxing] ♪ Uh, uh, uh, uh... ♪ ♪ My genetic is so magnetic ♪ ♪ Kinetic energy, got an enemy... ♪ ♪ Pop, pop, more shots than a diabetic ♪ Whoa! Officer? This way, this way. ♪ Does it look like I'm playing around? ♪ ♪ Suit up! ♪ This way, this way! ♪ Go, go, go! ♪ We need to stop. So far, the only thing crazier than Rib Bone's candy army is not having a plan, okay? I think we need to take a little... [dreamy electronic music] ♪ Give me a second, okay? ♪ Grace, I don't feel right. I feel like my heart's gonna beat out of my chest. Okay, uh, just go outside and get some fresh air, okay? I'll be there in five minutes, I swear. - Okay? - Grace... ♪ ♪ ♪ [eerie music] [choking] Where did you get this? Grace, what the hell are you doing? This was Karma's locket. She would have never taken it off. Now, this bitch better have a damn good explanation as to why she has it. She can't explain anything if you're choking her. Fine. We'll do it your way. [gasping] That's... you're still choking her. Back off, Barbie. I didn't know it was Karma. She left it behind - when they checked her out of here. - Who's they? It was months ago. I don't remember his name. Why didn't anybody contact me? - I don't know. - Where did they take her? I don't know! Damn it! Do you know anything? [panting] ♪ All the outtake paperwork's in a storage closet by reception. I-I could take you there. - That's where Rib Bone is. - Great. We kill two birds, one stone. You in? I was gonna ask you the same thing. Go. ♪ Just 'cause my CPU is far superior to your brain doesn't mean I don't understand you. You were free. You never had to see me ever again. And yet, you couldn't help yourself. You had to be... What do you humans call it? ♪ A hero? [snaps fingers] ♪ [groans] What the hell did you give to me? Arabica espresso, coconut water, some Karo Syrup, and 4 milliliters of patented synthetic amebic dysentery. [groaning] They engineer it two floors down. [panting] I need a bathroom! Now, now, no premature eruptions. We need everything you've got. Aki, whatever... whatever you're thinking about doing, you don't have to do it, you don't have to... [groans] [panting] If you want the best apple, you've gotta pluck it straight from the tree. ♪ Oh, shit! Exactly. [yelling] [screaming] You guys go for the records. I'll take care of Rib Bone. Hey. Where is he... Sic 'em. [yelling] What's your story? I want my candy. - Where's my candy? - Bitch! [ominous music] ♪ [air hisses] ♪ - Welcome to Wonderland, Alice. - Let go of me, you jizzy pedophile! I know my rights! - Come on! - [grunting] Get off me! Off me! [yelling, panting] I know it may not feel like it, but you're doing the right thing. Get off! You're so full of shit, Grace! Twatsicle whore! I hope that Primo dick gave you gonorrhea! What now, Doctor? I have never seen anybody take so much Red. We're not even sure what the long-term consequences might be. She may very well have permanent psychosis. She's gonna have to stay indefinitely. The state will cover two weeks payment. Do you have a plan to pay her bills after that? I'll figure something out. Grace! Wait, Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace, don't leave me! Please, Grace, don't leave me! [shaky breathing] [sniffling] [engine turns over] Mahalo. - Looking for this? - The fuck did you do to my car? Who the hell are you? Try "thank you," it's easier. I wasn't even in there for an hour. - How did you do this? - I saw you talking to the Primo. You're a real firecracker. Devotion to family... that's a rare commodity these days. I don't have time for this shit. That's what I like about you, Grace. You see right through everybody's bullshit. I'll be brief. Blood Drivers! They bathe in quite the spotlight. You seem like the type of girl who likes to win. How would you like to be the new Primo? ♪ Not interested. Oh. [exhales] They also make a lot of money. You can do it for the cash prize. Sounds like your little sister is in need of some very expensive medical care. What do you say? ♪ [horn blaring] [Bailey grunting] [growling] You promised a whole bag of fucking candy! Where's my candy? [screaming] [neck cracks] ♪ Hey, asshole. Come fight me like a man. See what happens when I'm looking at you. [loud thud] [groans] Come on, pretty boy. [grunts] [groaning] ♪ Ouch. Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
