 Oh, fudge. What time is it? I got to go to Veggie Village for the Annual Technology Fair. Will you all watch my Princess plant for me? I usually hire a sitter, but, eh! Of course, Princess. Awesome. Thank you, Finn. I will be back on the Morrow. Screeeee! You're in good hands, Princess Plant.

 "And then the monster got punched in the head, and the Princess was safe. And everyone was happy." Aah! Time to lay down, beautiful buddy. Yeah. Time to make sleepies. Ahh. We killed it, man! I know! Okay, all we got to do is go to the land of the dead and reclaim the flower's soul from death before Bubblegum returns. Okay.

 Excuse me? But did you all say "Land of the dead"? Oh, what? Oh, uh, yeah. I can take you. Really? Certainly, Finn. For a small price, which we can discuss later. Take my hands, gentlemen. Stare into where the two walls meet. Now slowly cross your eyes. Do it, fools! The portal opens. Say hi to Death for me if you see him. He lives in a castle made of light. Uh, okay. Thanks, Peppermint Butler. And don't drink the... water. Wow, man. Who knew Peppermint Butler was so 00... Aah! So, um, you want to hop in my paunch and I'll stretch us down? Uh... Oh, look. An escalator. Hey, dude. That must be the main entrance or some biz. Let's go! Wholly schmao. Welcome to the underworld. Cause of death? Uh, spear in the neck. You may enter. Yay! How did you die? Uh... Because we're awesome. Whoo! Hmm. Step out of line. Aw, dingle. Wait up, dude. Follow me and do as I do. Hey! I said no! Hey! He-e-y! Ha ha! We're in! Come on, man! Man. - Yes! - Yes! Where do we go now, dude? UP there! Ooh! Death's castle is pretty, dude. Let's go! Hup! Yah! Hey! Hey, what's up, fellas? Hi. Lester. Oh, man... flesh. I haven't seen this stuff in forever. So warm and gushy and salty. Look at all that flesh jiggling. Hey. If you love flesh so much, then watch this. Whoa! You don't know what you're doing to me, guy. Fellas, get over here! Flesh! Flesh? Yeah. - Ooh, for us? - Whoo-hoo! Yeah. Flesh. This is weird, man. Eh, don't worry. They just think we're cool. Hmm. Do you guys think we're cool? No. We're gonna rip that flesh off you and eat it. It's bone-kicking time! Huah! Huah! Oh, shoot! Ugh! Get... Ugh, ugh! Jake, there's too many! They're trying to peel me! I'm... not... a... banana!! Hole! It's not a hole, Jake. It's just a divot. Ugh! Sorry! They're getting away. Yeah! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get some bad blood. Dude, shrink down. Oh, sorry. I don't like the underworld too much. I don't know. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't folks trying to eat our skin. I wonder how Princess Bubblegum is doing. So, who here invented this thing? I'm glad she's not coming back till tomorrow. No, she said she's coming back "On the Morrow." Yeah, on the morrow. That means tomorrow. No, man. The Morrow is her bird. Come again. It's her bird. That thing is crazy fast. It'll only take her, like, 20 minutes to get back once that conference is over. Are you listening, man? The Morrow... is... a... bird. Then we got to go! Coast is clear! Halt! Hey. Hey, Halt. Why you got your eyes closed, Halt? I'm trying to picture in my mind's eye where the fleshies are hiding. Ohh. You're a smart guy, Halt. Wait. Jake, do you hear something? I don't know where they are. Come on. Then I didn't see them. I was looking here. And now they're gone. More skeletons. We've got to be really, really quiet. Get 'em! Jake. I thought it would be funny! Ugh! Ya-a-h! Look! There's death's castle! I don't see anyone. I guess you double-killed them with that Avalanche. Awesome. Now we just got to cross that river. River! Man, I'm so thirsty. My mouth's still all dusty! Yes. Aah! Drink the water. Whoa. Okay, Jake. Don't drink the water. Come on! I'm so thirsty! Dude, that skull wants you to drink the water. It's bad water. Don't drink the water. See? That means good, right? Yep! Jake? Jake, why are you making stupid face? Who's Jake? Dang it! I knew that water was junk! Tricked again by the river of forgetfulness! Jake! Get out of that water right now! Hey, I don't know who you are, Mister, but I don't like your attitude. Help! Somebody! Farewell, everyone. Tsk. Okay. Morrow, back to the Candy Kingdom. Help! Somebody help me! Stranger danger! Hey. Hey. I see you. Jake, your head. Huh? Who are you? Who are you? I don't know, man. Who are you? What do you mean? You're in my castle! Well, I didn't know. Dang it, Jake. You must leave this place... now. Death! We're not leaving until you give us our plant's soul... and Jake's memory! Another one. Be gone, mortal! No! I promised Princess Bubblegum. Ya-a-h! Huh? Ugh! Ohh. What happened? You can't kick me because your brain is stupid! Hah! Your brain is stupid! This kid's pretty funny. All right. Pick an instrument. Huh? To get stuff from me, you have to beat me in a musical battle. But Jake's the musical one, and he's got poo brain! I don't care. I got to find one I can really play. Oh, Glob, man. Oh, here we go. Sleigh bells! Yeah-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow! So the contest begins. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!! Ye-e-ah! Uhh, um... Hey, all right, so... who do you think won? Oh, man! Skeleton guy by a landslide! He was like... Dude! What? Skeleton guy was awesome. You want me to lie? Yes. I'm going to kill you now. No! I still have to rescue stuff! Those are the rules in the land of the dead. Lose a music battle, lose your life. Oh, wait, wait, wait! Before I die, I'm honor-bound to tell you Peppermint Butler says hi. What?! You know Peppermint Butler? Yeah. Yo, you guys can have whatever you want. Jake, stand up. That's me, right? Yes. What are you doing? What are you doing?! Kiss of death, baby. You got your memory back. AW, gross! I Wish I didn't. Now I shall return the soul of this. Yeah, the Princess Plant! I'll see you dudes later. Hello, boys. Where's my plant? Hello, Princess. Yay! Mm, mmm-mmm. Thank you, all, for taking such good care of my plant. Now, come here and give me a hug. Yay! Hugs! You guys are the best. Ahem. Mr. Finn? Mr. Jake? I believe you still owe me something in exchange for that favor I did. - Sure. - Yeah. What is it? I'd like your flesh. Quit being silly, Peppermint Butler. I'm going to take it from you while you sleep!
