[beeping] - [thinking] seismic activity Centered 200 miles south close to atlantis. I'd better check that out. [narrating] a visit to aquaman's kingdom Invariably means an adventure Due, in no small part, to his larger-than-life personality. - And thus, I turned back the invasion of the anemonoles. You can read more about that adventure in my new memoir. Batman, narrating: As king of atlantis, - [both grunt] - [groans] - Aquaman, are you hurt? - Yes. I'm hurt that you didn't tell me you were stopping by! How are you? - [grunting] - Hang on. There'sosomeone else here who wants to say hi. - [dolphin chatters] [chattering and clicking] - Fluke! Look how excited he is. - [thinking] fluke, the most obnoxious dolphin on the planet. - Boy, did he miss you, batman! - Tell him to release the suit. - Oh, batman, he's just a dolphin, for neptune's sake. - [fluke chatters] - fetch, boy! Happy? - Someone wants you out of the way. - Happens constantly Villains are always coming down here To take a potshot at the kingfish. - Little brother, what happened here? - Everything's fine. Batman here totally saved my seaweed. - Orm? - Big shock, I know. But we're talking again-- for the first time since I became king. - [crowd cheering] - After my brother's coronation, I admit, pride made me do some foolish things, batman, But age has brought wisdom And the lesson of the importance of family. - Those yes s we were apart were hard on me, too. - My men will look into who's responsible for this outrage. - I know, I know. You don't trust him. - A tiger shark doesn't change its stripes. Hehe's family. Anyway, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit, My faithful friend? Tell me you're joining us for our celebration this evening. - Actually, I'm here to check out Some unusual seismic activity along the shelf. [beeping] - Undersea plate movement? Happens all the time. [rumbling] - See? Still, where batman goes, adventure follows. Mind if I tag along? [beeping] - 18, 19, 20. And this will be the throne room. What do you think of the view, black manta? - Too many buildings. I prefer an unobstructed ocean view. - And I prefer an assassin who can shoot straight. You failed me, manta. - Only due to batman's unexpected interference. Worry not. Soon, we will correct the gross injustice That has denied you the throne. - And you will reap the rewards of the king's vast fortune. - I will reap more than that. - My brother's spies are everywhere. We will make another attempt for the crown When he returns from his adventure to the shelf. - He went to the shelf, Away from the city Where there will be no weaknesses? I suggest that if prince orm ever wants to be king orm, Itit's time he stepped up. - And that's how I recovered the stolen statue. I call that adventure the mystery of the stolen statue. The secret of the mechanical sea monster. Coral reef rescue. And the time I wore an eye patch To infiltrate a crew of pirates, I call that-- - Aquaman's undercover adventure. - No, the time I wore an eye patch to infiltrate a crew of pirates. But what you said is good, too. - Shark attack. - No, he's fleeing, but from what? [groans] - I got this. Honestly, it's the easiest part of the job. [sonar beeping] - Outrageous! They're not listening! Batman, narrating: I know what you're thinking. Belly of the whale. It can't get much worse. And you would be wrong. Uhh! Ahh! [grunting] - I don't know what's gotten into you two, But you'll have to do better than that. [grunting] Uhh! Ooh! Uhh! Ahoy there. [electronic whirring] - Uhh! Aw, crabcakes. [electronic whirring] [sonar beeping] - [belches] - That was outrageous! What's it like inside a whale? - I won't be ordering the calamari for a while. - The whales were wearing these. They claimed they were overcome By an irresistible urge to attack. - Orm has the same telepathic powers you do. He may have ordered the attack And used these to block out your telepathy, So you couldn't call it off. - Batman, I know you and orm have had your issues. - Issues? You mean the time he used a stolen sonar weapon To commandeer a nuclear sub? - Look, orm left atlantis soon after I was crowned. He drifted for years, Lost his moorings. But the prodigal brother has returned, And I'm giving him a second chance. Besides, orm's no genius. This is no doubt the work of my archenemy black manta. And my brother would never team up with that psycho. Manta wants to destroy atlantis. Orm loves the city as much as I do. - What he loves is power, Which you would see if you weren't blinded by guilt Over mommy putting you first. - Just drop it, old chum. Now show me why you've brought me here. [beeps] Ththis is the spot, Though there's nothing here to cause a disturbance. - [dolphin chattering] - Fluke! Wow, does he like you! - [chattering] - We have a party to prepare, right. Unless there's anything else you'd like to check out. And may the spirit of adventure That led our people here so long ago Continue to inspire atlantians For another 12,000 years. [cheers and applause] - [thinks] deadly sea urchin toxin. Gotcha! - [all gasping and murmuring] - Anything you care to confess? - Batman! Release my brother at once! - But I saw him-- - what? Flavor my drink? Sea urchin venom is toxic to surface people, Not to us. You have to go. I like you, batman, but this is family. You understand. See that batman is escorted safely to the coast. People skills, batman. It's about respect. - Brother, w word in private, if I may. - Of course, orm. Anything. And I'm sorry about batman. - I want your opinion, brother. [grunts] Does this make me look like a king? - Orm? - A king deserves a royal name. You became aquaman. Call me ocean master. - [both grunting] - How could you? I welcomed you back with open arms, Even after all you did. - I'm only taking back what's mine, brother! - I'm done apologizing for mom's decision. She loved you, but she gave me the throne Because she knew you couldn't handle the power. - Then let's see how you do. - [groaning] Batman was right about you... And about me. - Don't expect batman to bail you out Because right now, Your old chum is about to bereresh chum. I love vanilla, I love cocoa. I love vanilla, I love cocoa. I love... St m make up your mind! But I-I... I can't! I can't! Then choose rice krispies cocoa. It's made with a hint of real cocoa! I love cocoa! Pop: Hey, hey, What about vanilla flavour rice krispies? It's got the smella... Both: ...Vanilla, oh yeah! So what's it going to be? Kellogg's rice krispies cocoa cereal Or vanilla flavoured rice krispies cereal? But I love them both! (wet explosion) (splattering) (vase shattering) That's weird. How did your gushers get in my hand? Gushers. Beware the... (wet splatter) - [grunts] [grunting] [water dripping] [groaning] - No cry to your scaly friends will help, hero. - Finay y I am king, Annenever again will I have to listen To another one of your inane adventure stieies. - Black manta will betray you at the first opportunity. Ththis must be where you try to turn us against each heher. Aah! [groans] - I wanted to do that within 5 minutes of knowing him, But I needed him alive to get to you. Now I can begin my endgame. The tremors batman felt Were tests on a series of destabilizers I set up along the continental shelf. Once started, the shf f will collapse, And I'll have the pleasure of plundering the ruins. [aquaman gruinin Now excuse me, my los.S. It'shohowte.E. [dolphin chaerering] [sha g gros]s] [chaerering continues] [c[cwdwd cererin [crowd gasps] - What's going on? - - Wh's he dodog g re? - Ladieses a gentlemen, Cities rise, and cities prosper,, But atlantis is going downwn [rumbling] [all gasping] [screaming and chattering] [maniacal laughter] - It's hopeless. - Where's your never-say-die attitude, brother? Besides, who needs telepathy? [whistles] - Can we put our differences aside for atlantis? - Yes...Sire. [creatures growling] [rumbling] - You're too late, batman. Atlantis is about to be a memory, And aquaman along with it. He and his brother fell for my trap hook, line, and sinker. - Actually, we're the fish that got away. En garde! [all grunting] [whale roars] - Aah! [grunting] - You--you saved me. - I'm the king. It's what I do. [rumbling] - Yaah! [grunting] - Yaah! Aah! - Your undersea coup is over, manta. The next stop-- a small cell at iron heights. - Outrageous! I knew you had a hero inside you looking for a way out. - It was easy. Every time I smashed a machine, I just imagined it was your face. - Oh. Well... Good job. - So you decided to give him another chance. You could have exiled him. - I know, but you don't give up on family. - [thinking] just when I was wondering If aquaman learned anything From "the adventure of the bad brother"... - Now...Where to begin? Of course! The beginning. "chapter one: A king is born." - [thinking] I realized he knew exactly what he was doing. - "even a king can begin life "in the humblest of circumstances. "indeed my earliest memories are of a lighthouse "nestled on the shores of mercy reef..." -- Sync by Rafael UPD -- www.addic7ed.com/
