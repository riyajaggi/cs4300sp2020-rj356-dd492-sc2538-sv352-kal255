 Previously on "Black Box"... I'm lifting the ban on you and Esme seeing one another. She has to create a video documentary. Stop snapping the rubber band. (SNAPPING) That new hostess stop snapping at the restaurant? I slept with her. Delilah. I know exactly who you are. What I see is a stupid little girl trying to turn a one-night stand into a lot of trouble. That was a lot more than that. I mean...

 (GASPS) You're crazy. Maybe I am. (MONITOR BEEPING) (SIGHS) Microscissors. Careful you don't nip the MCA, or he'll lose his ability to speak. Whoa. Whoa! Nip the PCA, and he's paralyzed. Geez, you almost hit the hippocampus. Poor guy won't even recognize his own mother. Leo. Enough. I'm just saying.

 Neurosurgery is astounding, isn't it? This is the game played at its highest level. It's not a game. It's a patient. And his life is in your hands. This is why I went to medical school... To be among the most exceptional doctors in the field. Oh, my God! Shut up! Stop distracting me! (SIGHS) (ALARM BEEPING) I tore it. (EXHALES SHARPLY) We're bleeding bad. Utilize high-powered suction to clear the operative field. Obtain proximal control of the bleeding vessel. Place a silver neuro clip across the bleeder. Okay. Okay. (EXHALES SHARPLY) (FLATLINE) Call it. (SIGHS) 6:45 A.M. (MACHINE WHIRS) WOMAN: Simulation failure. Congrats. You just killed a promising engineer and a father of twins. Oh, come on. One day you're gonna have your own practice somewhere Cosmopolitan, like Fargo, north Dakota. I can see it now. Ali Henslee... horse doctor. Synced by emmasan www.addic7ed.com (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) I got it sized. What do you think? My grandmother would be proud. Though she might also wonder, "why is this white girl wearing my ring?" It's gorgeous. My grandfather made it by hand. He was a welder in Detroit. - Really? I didn't know that. - Mm-hmm. Dr. Black! (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Dr. Bickman. This is Will. He's my, um... Fiancé... Fiancé. I'm sorry. Sorry. I haven't had my coffee this morning. Just chalk that one up to transient aphasia. It's, um, medical jargon for "temporary loss of language." So I take it you're not a doctor. I'm a chef. Huh! Really? I got to get to the restaurant. - Okay. - I'll see you later. Nice to meet you. Hey, Will. Call me later, okay? All right. Okay. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) You sure? Next! (LAUGHS) Me. This guy. Right here. And you are? Mike Villetti, the next Bobby Fischer. Ah. Take a seat. No. Thanks. Bam! (HORNS HONKING) (CHESS PIECE THUDS) Bam! (CHUCKLES) Bam! Check! (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) How long you been playing chess, Mike? I just started two weeks ago. Hmm. I'm a prodigy. I can play all night. This... this thing is on fire. (SNIFFLES) Bam! Checkmate! Game over, Harvard! Ladies and gentlemen! The new king of the park... Mike Villetti! Wow. Congratulations. What do you do for a living, Mike? I'm a cabby... uptown, downtown, brooktown, midtown, queensbridge, borough hall, wherever. Whatever you need, I'm the best. Ah, wonderful. How about you drive me back to work? And if you have a minute, there's some people there that would like to meet you. - (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) - What? You... with a cook. He's a chef. You're a snob. The Marco Polo of the brain doesn't even know her own mind. Hey, what do you guys talk about, anyway? Quinoas? (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) You know, I hope one day you know what it feels like to come home to someone who actually cares about you. (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER P.A.) Uh, in 204, we have a case of amaurosis fugax resulting from a T.I.A. - When was the patient admitted? - Uh, uh... What were the lab results? Uh... (SIGHS) I-I'm sorry. Ali, what is it? (SIGHS) I lost a patient this morning on a simulator, and it's eating at me. It's a virtual patient. That's no big deal. Anyway, you're not going into neurosurgery. You're on team Black, not Bickman. I don't know if I'm good enough to be on anyone's team. Everyone here's got, like, a superpower. Leo's like a walking encyclopedia. I don't hire unexceptional people. Besides, Leo does not deserve a medal for his memory. Come on. I'm gonna show you something. Sit down, hyper-memory boy. (BEEPING) Can I have a picture of the scan for my mom to show her bridge club? Yes. (FEEDBACK) Okay, Leo, we're gonna map your brain with this beautiful Omore machine. Optical measurement of recorded events. Calm down, Google. I feel like I'm being exploited for my mind. You're a sub-intern. You live to be exploited. Okay, so unlike the MRI images of the brain, the Omore generates a real-time movie. So, look, I'm gonna ask him some questions. Watch. (FEEDBACK) Can you state your full name, please? Leo Jesse Robinson. - Place of birth. - Cambridge, Massachusetts. And do you recall the NASA space shuttle Challenger? You mean the space shuttle that blew up 73 seconds after takeoff on January 28, 1986, at 11:38 eastern standard time? Yes, that's the one. Can you name the passengers, please? LEO: Ronald McNair, Judith Resnick, George Read, Richard Henry Lee. Okay, sorry. That'll do. Um... What did you have for lunch that day? LEO: Breaded fish sticks, green beans, and a fruit roll-up. Oh... and ketchup. They were out of tartar sauce. Thank you. LINA: People with superior memory, like Leo, have an overabundance of connectivity between the visual cortex, the temporal cortex, and the hippocampus. That's what enables them to remember every single tiny detail of their life. I wish I could do that. Join the club, but this is not a learned trait. He won the genetic lottery. He was born that way, and you... You were born with your own gifts, okay? Empathy, problem-solving skills. These are equally, if not more important, for doctors. So do not forget that. (FEEDBACK) You can get out of that thing now, Leo. I need a little help. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) What up, genetic lottery? Want me to frame it for you? We get it. Your mommy only loved you when you excelled, so you're constantly seeking female validation of your bad-ass brain power. Don't be jealous, Ali. If you owned a Tesla, you'd show it off, too. Whatever. Half the stuff you say can't be proved. I mean, what you had for lunch the day the Challenger exploded? How old were you? I was 9. It was a Tuesday. 86 degrees. My mom took me to see "the Goonies" to cheer me up. Wait. You couldn't have been 9 when the Challenger exploded. It was 1986. T-that would make you 38. (GASPS) And "Goonies" came out before we were even born! You're making this stuff up. You're not remembering at all. (PAPER SLIDES) KATE: Hello? WILL: Hey, guess what. My staff is throwing us an engagement party. - That's very sweet of them. When? - Tonight. - Tonight?! - Mm-hmm. Oh, will... Couldn't we push it? Do you have other plans? Wouldn't you rather have our own engagement party? Just... the two of us? Maybe we could open that... Special bottle of wine. You can open that special bottle of wine at the party. Okay? Okay. Uh, just tell me, will "what's her name" be there? - You mean Delilah? - Yeah. No. Not if you don't want her there. I-I could care less. I don't want her within a hundred miles. 10:00 P.M. at the restaurant. Can't wait to see you. Yeah. I'll be there around 10:00. Yeah. Okay. Love you. Bye. (CELLPHONE BEEPS) You two are at the "love you, then hang up" stage? Jealous. Hmm. No! (GASPS) You tied that stud down. Actually, Lina, I'm terrified. Oh, but you are a little excited, right? Yeah... somewhere, buried deep beneath the dread. Give me. I want to play princess. Careful. Oh, wow. (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER P.A.) (GASPS) This is a beauty. Not that I'm obsessed with Will or anything. But if you ever kick him to the curb, I call first dibs. Okay. Not that I'm obsessed with him or anything. Yeah. I need to get this back. - But it looks so good on me. - I don't care. (GASPS) Oh, my God! (BOTH SCREAM) Oh, my God! It's okay. Um... Oh my God. This is just totally unacceptable. This is an emergency. I need a plumber! Dr. lark. Uh, can an omore scan tell whether or not someone is lying? No, there is no brain scan that can detect a lie. What Leo said was wrong. The Challenger astronauts that he listed... I looked them up online. Two of them were signers of the Declaration of Independence. So his memory isn't as great as he thinks. And to cover it up, he's deliberately lying? I-I'm not sure. I-I called him on it, and he didn't seem to understand. He just looked blank and walked away. I... (INHALES DEEPLY) He's behaving strangely. Should I tell Dr. Black? (BREATHING HEAVILY) I'd wait until she's not having a full-blown panic attack. (SIGHS) (RINGING) (PILLS RATTLE) (CELLPHONE RINGING) (CELLPHONE BEEPS) - Hello? - KATE: Joshua? Uh, are you at work? No. I'm at the movies. Okay, I need your help. Y-you still know that guy, that plumber? He, uh... he did work on my bathroom. Smells like corn chips. The guy that smells like corn chips just happens to be the most exceptional plumber in all five boroughs. Okay, so I need him. I dropped my engagement ring down the drain at work here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. So the engagement's on? Yeah. Anyway, so the ring... it belonged to Will's grandmother. It's completely irreplaceable. All right, all right. Calm down. We'll take care of it. I'm on my way. (CELLPHONE BEEPS) How are you sleeping, Mike? I don't sleep. My sleep... (GROANS) What kind of doctor did you say you were, again, anyway? I'm a medicating psychiatrist. (CHUCKLES) You could get me on your couch any day. (CHUCKLES) What's your name, beautiful? Dr. Farrah Mahmoud. Farrah, Farrah, Kyocera. Farrah, fairest doctor of them all. (GRUNTS) How's your appetite? You look delicious. I could eat you all day. Doc. You got great mahmouds. One little squeeze. What do you say? Come on! You make house calls? Come on. Easy, Casanova! All right, Manuel, we need to get Mike a room and assign a sitter to watch him. Oh, and, uh, heads up... When they're hypersexual... anything goes. (CHUCKLES, GRUNTS) Come on. Come on. (DOOR CLOSES) FARRAH: (ECHOING) Impulsive, pressured speech, grandiose, irritable, prone to distraction, racing thoughts, impaired judgment, and hypersexual. Almost certainly bipolar. OWEN: That's what I suspected. The patient's wife just arrived. She's waiting in your office. Thank you. Owen, do you have any sway with maintenance? No. I, uh... I-I... dropped my engagement ring down the drain, and I-I have an engagement party tonight. Way to bury the lead! Congratulations! I need a plumber. Oh, I don't have any sway with maintenance. (SIGHS) I mean, I-I've been trying to get them to... Freud would say losing an engagement ring is an unconscious desire to lose the fiancé. Perhaps you'd like to schedule a session. I have some time this afternoon. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, welcome to the 21st century, Farrah. See, we no longer believe in Freud. Turns out, women don't have penis envy and mothers don't 'cause autism. Get me a lab coat! Get me a lab coat! MAN: Hey, get over here! I can cure cancer. It's okay, Mike. It's okay. I want to hear all about it. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm still waiting on a sitter. I had to check on another patient. There's some people with cancer this way. We can go cure them over here. Come on. - Watch here. - Did you see his eye? I did. But I appreciate your help treating my patients. Bipolar. It's... tragic. Treatable, but a crippling, lifelong affliction. You know, I don't think of people with bipolar as cripples. I'm sorry. I don't. Okay? I mean... (EXHALES DEEPLY) Stephen Fry, Jane Pauley, Virginia Woolf. Dr. Mahmoud and I need to talk to Mike's wife. - Really functional people... - FARRAH: Mm-hmm. Who live and breathe in this world. I mean, have you read "An Unquiet Mind"? You should check it out. ELMIRA: I thought at first, the stress was from, you know, getting laid off. He lost his job? Mike was a cop, like his dad. The job meant everything to him. He drives a taxi now. It barely covers our bills. He started drinking. (VOICE BREAKING) And he loses his temper with the kids. Is there any history of depression or mental illness in Mike's family? - No. - Alcohol or drug abuse? Suicide? (SCOFFS) Well, his dad did like to drink scotch with his dinner. I believe your husband suffers from bipolar disorder, Elmira, sometimes known as manic-depression. It's a form of mental illness, but the good news is it's treatable. Wait. Are you saying he's crazy? Mike's not crazy, okay? He was steady as a rock. Bipolar disorder can suddenly present itself at any age. You diagnose it on the basis of behavior, and... Mike's behavior is textbook. Left untreated, it's a dangerous condition. Mike could cycle into depression. But if he stays on his medication, he could live a totally normal life. Stress, illness, or a sudden life change... Like losing his job. Can set off a manic or depressive episode. It's a lifelong battle to monitor this disease, but one that can be won, Elmira... If the patient is willing to accept treatment. (HORN HONKS) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Hey. Got a second? For you? Anytime. Be right back. - No. - Ow. Listen, the other day was a mistake. I'm engaged. It was wrong, and I take full responsibility. It wasn't wrong. It was inevitable. And you running into Catherine... - That was a coincidence. - That's not what she thinks. Anyway, it's over. I hope you can handle that. Yeah, I can handle it. I'm not sure you can. Don't overestimate yourself. It meant nothing. (CHUCKLES) Is this gonna be a problem? No. No. No problem. It was just a one-night stand, a meaningless "one afternoon..." "And all night long" stand. (INHALES DEEPLY) But, you know, I think that if you could get away with it, you'd do it again in a heartbeat. You're done for the day. Go home. What? Are you afraid I'll spoil your engagement party? (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) I won't. Relax. Don't worry. Got someone to take my shift as soon as I heard. It won't be a problem. (CHUCKLING) Okay. (PATS ARM) (FLASHLIGHT CLICKS) I think these things just unscrew. No, you got to go in through the drain, like a nasoscopy. Guys, I'm pretty sure it's righty-loosey, lefty-tighty. Don't you take computers apart and put them back together in your sleep? Yes. It's too bad she didn't lose her ring down a hard drive. We need one of those things that grabs the pipe and... Yanks it in a twisting motion. Like a wrench? (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER P.A.) You should have seen it. Some of the greatest minds in science baffled by a drain pipe. I guess they don't teach plumbing 101 at Harvard Medical School, huh? Leo, you know how to get a ring out of a drain? Obviously. See? There's still some real men around here. You use this to unscrew the lug nuts. Once you get those off, you hoist the transmission and unbolt the compressor from the motor pulley, and you get your ring out through the water hose. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) So that was your idea of a joke? Give me my folder. He's not joking. He thinks he's telling the truth. Leo! Are you a kung-fu master? Absolutely. Also an expert in the Japanese ninja techniques of infiltration and assassination. So... you're... a ninja? Yes, I am. - ALI: Dr. Black! - Yeah? - I really think you need to see this. - What is it? Leo, did Dr. Bickman ride a horse to work today? He arrived at 8:45 A.M. on an Arabian stallion. Anything you ask, Leo has his usual elaborate answer. He always answers yes, and he's almost always wrong. Ignore her, Dr. Black. She's obviously jealous. Do you really believe that, Leo? Bickman arrived on a stallion? I saw it when I got off the bus. What color was the horse? Was it... was it pink? Kind of fuchsia. Somewhere between a magenta and a mountbatten pink. You ever been to the moon, Leo? Of course. Where do you think I landed after the Challenger exploded? (WHIRRING) (FEEDBACK) Okay, Leo, we'll have you out of there in a minute. Just bear with us. LEO: Anything for science, Dr. Black. Okay, off we go. (CLICK) (COMPUTER BEEPS) One more. (CLICK) (COMPUTER BEEPS) Hey, go again. (CLICK) (COMPUTER BEEPS) One more. (CLICK) (COMPUTER BEEPS) Can you show me this slice? (COMPUTER BEEPS) Deeper. (COMPUTER BEEPS) LINA: I don't want to see that. Yeah, neither do I. But Leo has a brain tumor, whether we want to see it or not. (FEEDBACK) Okay, Leo. Out you come. (WHIRRING) JOSHUA: I'm afraid it's gonna be like the Ford Greenhouse. Yep. - Hey. - Hey, your sister asked me to meet you. She's pretty upset. One of her most promising sub-interns has a brain tumor. Ohh, man. I'm sorry. It's bad news here, too, on a far lesser scale. Yeah, with stainless steel, no-hub piping like this, I'm guessing that ring slid all the way down to the basement. Yeah. Um, lina's a submarine. She could show you the way. I'll put this back together. Submarine? It's what they call radiologists. Our machines are all below ground in rooms with no windows. And like submarines, we rarely surface. Must be hard on your love life. Mm, not really, since my love life is nonexistent. Come on. (DOOR OPENS) (CHUCKLES) (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER P.A.) Remember... find the ring. You, uh, seem young to be a doc. Well, I'm a prodigy. You know, like one of those freak kids who start playing Beethoven at age 5. (CHUCKLES) I was barely out of diapers when I started dissecting small animals. Huh. I'm a prodigy, too. At 5, I took apart a water heater. You're right. We're basically twins. KATE: So the tumor failed to register on the Omore, but it did show up on the MRI here. Craniopharyngioma's pressing up on his hypothalamus and his mammilary bodies. That's what's causing him to confabulate. - The kid's been lying? - No, he doesn't know he's lying. Confabulation is memory disturbance. He attempts to answer as accurately as possible. When he doesn't know the answer, his brain compels him to make it up. So he starts spewing all these fabrications and absurdities. Useful if you happen to be a politician. Yeah, but game over for an aspiring neurosurgeon. Why did we not pick up on this? We, his super memory masked it. Confabulators think their lies are true. And no matter what question you ask them, the answer's always "yes." So we don't know how long this has been going on? (SIGHS) Well, that could be beneficial. Slow growth and localization are often indicative of a benign tumor. Regardless, we're gonna have to cut it out entirely. Well, the safer route would be to debulk and then follow up with radiation. (SCOFFS) Come on. Radiation is hardly risk-free. There could be memory loss. That'd be a disaster to this kid. Well, it's better than total blindness, right? I mean, that's the real risk, when you cut that close to the optic nerve. There is a bit of a risk, but I have incredible... Incredible stats. Yes, I know. Are you aware of the studies that say the more talented the surgeon, the better the resolve? Are you aware of the studies that show overconfident surgeons are the most likely to make mistakes? If this kid were mine, I'd say don't radiate. What's his name? This "kid" that's been shadowing you for over a month... What's his name? Leo. His name is Leo. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) MAN: Microbiology, line 8327. Microbiology, 8327. (BREATHING RAPIDLY) ELMIRA: Mike. Honey. Can't sit down. Can't stop moving. Can't sit still. Well, you haven't slept in over 48 hours. The pills that they gave you... Are they helping you? Everything's... yeah, yeah, t-they're great. I'm a new man. (BREATHING RAPIDLY) Sorry. Forgot I'm a prisoner in here. (SIGHS) Sorry. - Aah! - Oh, my God! (GROANING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh, my gosh! Help! I don't think bickman should be the one to tell Leo. No, you and I will do it, and, Ali, you should come. But I-I don't think he'll understand any of this. No, I don't, either. I'm contacting his parents, okay? He just needs to be around people that care about him. - Did you find Leo? - We couldn't find him. Dr. Morely, Mike Villetti attacked his sitter. Cracked his skull with a chair. Okay, you find Leo. Farrah, you're gonna have to come with me. Mike has attacked... - Okay. - No! It's okay. You tried to poison me! No, no, Mike. No, no. (SCREAMS) Mike... Mike, let her go. You don't... no, you don't... You don't... Let her go. Mike, look at me. Please. We're here to help you. You don't have to do this, Mike. (GASPING) No, no, Mike! Mike, no, no, no, no! (SCREAMS) Please! Mike. You! Please, you don't have to do that. Don't! Put it down! (WHIMPERING) Okay. Put it down. - Put it down. - Get back! - Get back! Get back! - Come on. It's all right. Come on. Mike. Mike. Security. Main lobby. Main lobby. (ALARM BLARING) Woman: Code silver. Code silver. Joshua. - Hey, I did what I could, but I'm... - No, forget that. We have a violent patient on the loose, okay? So you just stay in here and lock the door. - Only if you stay with me. - No, I'm fine. Mr. Villetti has Dr. Mahmoud hostage at reception. OWEN: No, no, no, no! Get back! (SCREAMS) Stay back! Stay back, everybody! Rats are eating my brain! She did this to me! - Let her go, please! - No, put the gun down! - He's sick! Put it down! - Shut off the alarm! Mike, what are you doing? Let her go! - Get away from me! - Okay, what meds did you put him on? Qupine, lithium. Mike, look at me. Look at me. You're on the wrong medication. Okay, that's all this is. That's all this is. Stop the rats. (GRUNTS) Stop the rats... Or she dies. (WHIMPERING) If you let her go, I promise I'll get rid of the rats. No, no, you're on her side. You get away from me! (SCREAMS) Mike. Mike, look at me, okay? Please! I have two kids. Please don't do this. It's okay. (BOTH CRYING) Please. (WHIMPERS) (GRUNTS) That's it. ELMIRA: Oh, my God! Easy! Easy! Easy, Mike! Easy! Give us a chance here. Mike. Just breathe. Just breathe. Mike. Look at me! Please don't. I need you. (SOBBING) (KNIFE CLANGS) - All right. Go. - All right. Manuel! - Okay, Mike. - MAN: Get him sedated. Go. (SOBBING CONTINUES) Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. All right. Get him on a gurney. Let's go. You're gonna be all right. (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER P.A.) (EXHALES SHARPLY) You see his blown pupil? Yeah, I saw that. He also has medial strabismus. It could be an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery. I should have caught that. We need imaging. Okay. (GROANS) (CAMERA WHIRRING) What is that? It's a closed-circuit infrared pipe-inspection cam with a 300-foot lead and 400,000-CCD-pixel resolution. (CHUCKLES) Check it out. Whoa. (LAUGHS) - (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) - ALI: Uh, Dr. Lark. You haven't seen Leo down here, have you? - I can't find him anywhere. - N-no, I haven't. Oh, Dr. Black wants to see you upstairs. Don't worry. I'll find the ring. (AS GOLLUM) Me wants it. Me needs it. Must have the precious. One ring to rule them all. One ring to find them. One ring to rule them all. BOTH: And in the darkness, bind them. (CHUCKLES) ALI: Dr. Lark. (RINGING) KATE: Hello? Hey. We still on for later? I'm still here. I'm gonna be here for a lot longer. Today is just hideous. No problem. Let's make it 11:00, after the late rush. Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks for understanding. Bye. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) What are you doing here? (LAUGHING) Oh, my God. Um, I'm working. I told you to go home. Chill. The restaurant's slammed. I'm just helping out. If I need help, I'll ask for it. Cool. Okay. Um, I'm out of here. Have an amazing party. (INHALES DEEPLY) All right? LINA: Mike's imaging doesn't show an aneurysm, but angiography reveals diffuse stenosis and ectasia of small vessels. Okay, the E.S.R., the CRP... They're elevated. Spinal fluid shows mild pleocytosis. Mike is not bipolar. Cerebral vasculitis. OWEN: Inflammation of the vessel walls. He said he felt like he had rats in his brain. It's a very apt description. Bipolar was a misdiagnosis, a huge screw-up. Yeah, well, let's not be too hard on Dr. Mahmoud, okay? Vasculitis of the brain is notoriously hard to... diagnose, right? We'll need a brain biopsy just to confirm. I'll go scrub. (DOOR OPENS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) ALI: Leo? (BREATHING HEAVILY) MAN:Dr. Bickman, please report to the O.R. - (SIGHS) - Dr. Bickman, please report to the O.R. (WATER RUNNING) - Ohh. - Dr. Bickman, please report to the O.R. Hey, they're paging Dr. Bickman. Are you Dr. Bickman? Yes, I am. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (MONITOR BEEPING) (DOOR SLAMS OPEN) What the hell's going on?! - Doctor? - MAN: It's Bickman. (GROANING, BREATHING UNEVENLY) WOMAN: He's seizing! (GRUNTS) Prepare the gurney. WOMAN: It's Leo. (CHOKES, GAGS) I understand that completely. I want to understand everything. So he had a seizure. The tumor resulted in diabetes insipidous, causing hypernatremia and culminating in a seizure. Our sub-intern Leo could have landed us in a very ugly malpractice suit. Luckily, you caught him in time, okay? Did we reach his parents? Found them on vacation in the Caribbean. They're flying in, but they won't be here until tomorrow. Did they make a decision? When I told them radiation could affect his memory, they flipped out. They want to excise the tumor completely. They'd rather risk him going blind. They know Bick's reputation. If I didn't think his odds were better with me, I'd say so. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) How's Mike? I'm starting him on high-dosage steroids. He'll be back to himself soon, okay? Good. Are you okay? I'm terrified for Leo. He told me once that his... his family, they, um... They made it clear to him all his life that he had to be exceptional, at the top of his field. You do know it's possible that he will make a full recovery in time. How long? Nobody is the same immediately after brain surgery. (VOICE BREAKING) And if he doesn't recover? Hey. (EXHALES DEEPLY) We're ready for you, Dr. Bickman. (MONITOR BEEPING) Number 15 blade. 15. MAN: Oxygen levels are good. Marker. Marker. Drill. Drill. (DRILL WHIRS) (DRILL WHIRRING) Okay. We're ready for our close-up. And forceps. (ALARM BEEPING) Okay, he's bleeding up here. Suction! WOMAN: Prepping suction. Cottonoids! (BEEPING CONTINUES) Got it. Anaesthesia. All right, hang a unit of packed cells plus two more in the room. We've got an arterial bleed feeding off the A-Co-A. MAN: I'm containing that. I need a clip now. Come on. I said "now"! (BEEPING CONTINUES) (BEEPING STOPS) Stable. (ALL SIGH) (INHALES DEEPLY) (SIGHS) Blood pressure's normal. Get me the score of the Knicks game, will you? (SCOFFS) Why don't you go wait for him in recovery? Bick is truly amazing, isn't he? Yeah. He is... You should go home. (LAUGHTER) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) ♪ Bound for Mississippi ♪ (SIGHS) Nope. That was the last pipe. (SIGHS) There's no more we can check. Sad to say the battle is over. Ohh, that sucks. Here. (GRUNTS) One, two... (METAL CLANGS) Sorry. No... way. (BOTH LAUGH) My precious. (SIGHS) That was very un-Lina. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I could get into un-Lina. (CHUCKLES) Oh, hang on. So you don't lose it. (WATCH BEEPING) Oh, my God.
