 Narrator: THE GREAT AMERICAN BOOMTOWN. YEAH! WE'RE IN THE WATER. HA-HA! Narrator: IN THIS REMOTE PORT... Narrator: THE COMING OF SUMMER MEANS THE RETURN OF THE ALASKAN GOLD-MINING FLEET. I LOVE GOLD BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO GET. THAT'S THE OLDEST STORY IN THE BOOK -- YOU ALWAYS WANT WHAT YOU CAN'T HAVE. NOME WAS ESTABLISHED, ORIGINALLY, AS A MINING TOWN. THERE'S BEEN A CENTURY OF PEOPLE COMING UP HERE AND BALANCING THEIR HOPES AND THEIR DREAMS UPON THAT BEAUTIFUL YELLOW SUBSTANCE. Narrator: SINCE 1898, WHEN THREE SWEDISH PROSPECTORS STRUCK GOLD IN THE WATERS OF ANVIL CREEK, MINERS HAVE FLOODED IN, HOPING TO STRIKE IT RICH. OVER A CENTURY LATER, THEY STILL COME IN DROVES, FOLLOWING THE GOLD FROM THE CREEKS TO THE BEACHES, NOW... WHO'LL START ME OFF? THE BID'S 10 EVEN. Narrator: TO OFFSHORE MINING CLAIMS IN CUSTOM-BUILT DREDGES. MINING FOR GOLD IN NOME IS A GRAND ADVENTURE. Narrator: EVERY JUNE... I'M GONNA MAKE SOME DAMN MONEY. Narrator: MODERN DAY '49ers SPLASH DOWN AND HEAD OUT TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNES OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE BERING SEA. I'M GONNA STUFF MY POCKETS FULL OF GOLD THIS YEAR. Narrator: THIS SUMMER, WHAT WAS ONCE A CLOSELY KEPT SECRET HAS BECOME THE ONE WORD ON EVERYONE'S MIND. BACK TO THE TOMCOD. THAT'S THE ONLY GOOD GOLD AROUND THIS COUNTRY. Narrator: THE TOMCOD CLAIM, LOCATED 7 MILES WEST OF THE HARBOR. THIS 1,000-ACRE AREA IS NOW GROUND ZERO FOR THE GOLD RUSH. THE TOMCOD LEASE. THERE'S PROBABLY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 BOATS OUT HERE, I SEE DREDGIN'. Narrator: WITH MORE DREDGES THAN EVER HEADED FOR ONE SMALL LEASE AND THE PRICE OF GOLD PLUNGING TO $1,200 AN OUNCE, THIS SEASON, THE COMPETITION WILL BE TOUGHER THAN EVER BEFORE. LET'S GO GET 'EM. LET'S GO GET THAT GOLD. Narrator: IN THE SMALL BOAT HARBOR... HERE WE GO! THEY GOT THE BOAT IN THE WATER, NOW, WE JUST GOTTA GET ALL THE DOODADS ON HERE. Narrator: SUMMER DREDGING'S UNSTOPPABLE GOLD MACHINE, THE 80-FOOT, 80-TON CHRISTINE ROSE. ALL THE LITTLE, LAST COUPLE THINGS DONE HERE, AND THEN, WE'RE READY TO GO MININ'. WE HAVE THE BEST DREDGE OUT THERE. I JUST LOVE BEIN' A MINER. MY FAMILY'S BEEN MININ' FOR 25 YEARS AND THAT'S HOW WE MAKE OUR LIVIN', IS GOLD MININ'. Narrator: FOR SIX SUMMERS... MR. GOLD SAYS, "MONEY, MONEY, MONEY!" Narrator: THE FATHER-SON TEAM OF STEVE AND SHAWN POMRENKE HAVE DOMINATED THE GOLD COUNT... I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE TALKING [BLEEP] ABOUT ME TO OTHER PEOPLE. BECAUSE YOU GIVE IT SO MUCH AMMUNITION! Narrator: DESPITE THEIR CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP. Steve P.: IT'S HARD FOR FATHERS AND SONS TO WORK TOGETHER. SHAWN REALLY DOES NOT NEED ME ON THE CHRISTINE ROSE ANYMORE. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO OFF AND DO WHAT I WANT TO DO. HE'S ALL TRAINED. HE KNOWS EVERY PIECE OF MACHINERY, HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON THERE. GOT THE ANCHORS ON, SPUD'S IN, EVERYTHING'S GETTIN' HOOKED UP. WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF WATER PLUMBING TO DO, LITTLE BIT OF WELDING. Narrator: FOR 62-YEAR-OLD STEVE POMRENKE, THIS SEASON IS ALL ABOUT AN EXIT STRATEGY. Steve P.: I'M LOOKIN' TO GO INLAND MINING. THAT'S WHAT I FEEL I'M REALLY GOOD AT AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY. I'D LIKE TO HAND THE OCEAN MINING OVER TO HIM 'CAUSE I'D LIKE TO GO INLAND MINING. SEE IF THE NEW CONTRAPTION'S GONNA WORK OR NOT. WELL, WE KNOW THE ENGINEER, SO. IT'LL WORK. Narrator: PUSHING FOR A 1,000-OUNCE SUMMER AND A NEW INLAND MINING VENTURE... Steve P.: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO AGAIN. WATCH IT, WATCH IT, WATCH IT. Narrator: STEVE HAS ENGINEERED ONE MASSIVE UPGRADE. HOLY COW! Narrator: A NEW 5x12-FOOT WASH PLANT SLUICE BOX. Steve P.: THIS ONE'S, LIKE, 3 TIMES BIGGER THAN THE OLD WASH PLANT. I CAN GO THAT WAY SOME, YET. MAKIN' HISTORY. LITTLE MORE! YEAH! Narrator: IT'S DESIGNED TO BE THE BIGGEST THE BARGE COULD POSSIBLY HOLD. JUST, HOPEFULLY, NO BIGGER. THEY'RE GONNA HIT. Steve P.: THEY AIN'T GONNA HIT. I GUARANTEE YOU. THEY AIN'T GONNA HIT! GROWIN' UP WITH STEVE POMRENKE, LET ME TELL YA, IT WAS HELL. I THINK DAD GREW UP WITH HIS DAD NOT ACCEPTING HIM OR GIVING HIM ANY CREDIT FOR ANYTHING, BUT DAD AND I ARE ACTUALLY GETTING ALONG PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW. WE'LL SEE HOW LONG IT LASTS. [chuckle] WE'RE GOOD, MAN! YEAH, LOOKS GOOD. WE'RE GONNA UP OUR PRODUCTION BY 30% WITH THIS NEW WASH PLANT, BE ABLE TO RUN 30% MORE DIRT, HOPEFULLY, GET 30% MORE GOLD, AND THAT SHOULD PUT US OVER OUR 1,000-OUNCE GOAL FOR THE YEAR. Narrator: AS FATHER AND SON AIM FOR ANOTHER WINNING SEASON, THERE'S ONE RACE THEY'VE ALREADY LOST. 7 MILES WEST OF THE HARBOR, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM, THE FIRST BIG BARGE TO MAKE IT TO THE GROUNDS... RAHH! BIG ROCKS, HARD DIGGIN'. Narrator: THE CHRISTINE ROSE's WOULD-BE RIVAL, THE 80-FOOT, 96-TON AU GRABBER. THAT'S THE PAY LAYER, RIGHT THERE. THERE SHE BE. IT'S A GOOD-LOOKING COLOR. IT'S HARD TO SAY HOW MUCH, EXACTLY, WE'RE GETTING, BUT, I'M HOPING WE'RE GETTING AT LEAST AN OUNCE AN HOUR, IF NOT A LITTLE BIT MORE, SO, JUST GOTTA KEEP AFTER IT. WE GOTTA KEEP THIS THING LOADED. Narrator: AT THE HELM? OWNER AND 2nd-YEAR MINER HANK SCHIMSCHAT. I'VE INVESTED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING I HAD. I TOOK MONEY OUT OF MY RETIREMENT TO DO THIS AND I NEED GOLD IN THAT HOPPER. I'VE DONE THE MATH -- IF I CAN KEEP UP MY OUNCE AN HOUR, I THINK I CAN GET 700 OUNCES. THAT'S WHAT MY GOAL IS THIS YEAR. WHOA, BABY! THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED. Narrator: AFTER DROPPING NEARLY A MILLION BUCKS BUILDING HIS OPERATION, HANK NEEDS HIS SOPHOMORE SEASON TO HIT BIG. YEAH, THE CHRISTINE ROSE IS NOT HERE YET. I GOT A LITTLE HEAD START ON 'EM. I'M HOPIN' I CAN KEEP UP WITH 'EM, OR EVEN SURPASSIN' 'EM. I'M NOT MUCH OF A SMACK-TALKER. IT'S NOT REALLY MY STYLE, BUT SHAWN CALLS ME THE "ASS" GRABBER, SO I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING LIKE CHRISTINE "HOS". [ STATIC CRACKLES ] CHRISTINE ROSE, CHRISTINE ROSE, THIS IS THE AU GRABBER. YOU COPY? GO AHEAD. HA-HA HA-HA! [ LAUGHS ] NEVER CHEATED LAST YEAR. YOU GOT YOUR ASS WHIPPED, BUDDY. [ LAUGHS ] I CAN MOVE MORE DIRT THAN SHAWN, I KNOW, SO, I WANT EVERY PIECE OF GOLD I CAN GET, SO HE DOESN'T GET IT. Narrator: WITH 42 YEARS BEHIND AN EXCAVATOR, WORKING CONSTRUCTION, HANK IS A PRO AT MOVING DIRT. HOW WE LOOKIN'? LOOKIN' GOOD. Narrator: BUT GOLD MINING IS ABOUT PAY DIRT. IS THERE ANY GOLD IN HERE? OH, YEAH. YEAH, YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE GOLD IN HERE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST PAN IT. PAN IT? YEAH. FIND US SOME GOLD! Narrator: CHECKING THE MATERIAL, HANK'S NEW DECKHAND, MATT PECKINPAUGH. WHOA-OA! WOW! THAT'S A GOOD PAN. THAT'S A GOOD PAN. GOOD GOLD, NICE, CHUNKY. THAT'S WHAT WE BEEN IN ALL DAY, SO. OH, BABY! I CAN'T WAIT. WE'RE GONNA BE DOIN' REALLY GOOD, SO, MAY THE BEST MAN WIN. Narrator: AS HANK GETS AFTER THE FIRST GOLD OF THE SEASON, 7 MILES TO THE EAST, LEAVING NOME HARBOR... HUNDRED FEET THAT WAY! Narrator: THE ONLY FEMALE DREDGE OWNER IN THE FLEET, CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL, AND THE 40-FOOT EROICA, HEADED FOR FAMILIAR GROUNDS. BASICALLY, WE'RE TRYING TO PUT IT RIGHT ON TOP OF THE TAILINGS PILE THAT WE LEFT FOR ICE WITH THIS GPS. WE WERE USING A SYSTEM DURING ICE THAT ENDED UP REALLY SCREWING US, IN THE END. IT DIDN'T PROCESS GOLD CORRECTLY. Narrator: THIS WINTER... WE'RE GONNA BLOW 'EM OUT OF THE [BLEEP] ICE. Narrator: EMILY DROPPED 50 GRAND ON TOP-OF-THE-LINE ICE-MINING GEAR AND A PROTOTYPE UNDERWATER DREDGE. Emily: THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY GOLD THERE. Narrator: BUT THE RIG COULDN'T CAPTURE GOLD AND ONLY RECOVERED 4 OUNCES, WORTH JUST OVER 5,000 BUCKS. WE'RE GETTIN' CLOSER, WITHIN 67 -- 65. Narrator: TO KICK OFF SUMMER, EMILY'S PLANNING TO MOP UP THE MISSED GOLD FROM HER WINTER TAILINGS PILE. DROP ANCHOR NOW, TONY. AT LEAST 66 POUNDS. I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WINTER IS OVER. IT WAS HORRIBLE. IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY UP HERE, OF MINERS, AND MOST OF THEM EXPECT ME TO FAIL. AS FAR AS I KNOW, I'M THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER TRY TO COME UP HERE AND RUN MY OWN DREDGE. I'M GLAD THE SUMMER IS HERE AND I'M HOPING TO GET 400 OUNCES. Narrator: EMILY HAS SET HER SIGHTS ON BEING THE FIRST WOMAN TO BREAK THE 400-OUNCE GLASS CEILING. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, IT'S CHAMPAGNE-SMASHING TIME! LET'S DO IT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY. OH, NO! YOU GOTTA GO HARD. OH! WHAT THE [BLEEP]?! THIS IS [BLEEP]. THIS IS SO [BLEEP]. WHAT THE [BLEEP]? CLOSE YOUR EYES. [BLEEP]. [ LAUGHTER ] SERIOUSLY! IT [BLEEP] BROKE THE CLEAT! [BLEEP]. RIGHT ON THAT CORNER, IT'LL BREAK. ALL RIGHT. COME -- WHOO! YA-A-Y! NOW, I'M GONNA DOWN THERE AND CUT MY FOOT ON BROKEN GLASS. WHOO-HOO! HOLY [BLEEP], THAT WAS HARD TO BREAK. FOUND YOUR GLASS! IT'S IN MY FOOT. ALL RIGHT, BERING SEA, BE GOOD TO US THIS YEAR. DON'T BE A [BLEEP] EMILY'S A YOUNG CAPTAIN. NOT SAYING SHE'S NOT GETTING THERE, BUT, SOMETIMES, YOU CAN ADMIT THAT YOU'RE TOO BIG FOR YOUR BRITCHES OR NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR YOUR BRITCHES, IT'S EITHER WAY. Narrator: FIRST DOWN FOR THE SEASON, 2nd-YEAR DIVER TONY MANN, WITH DARYL VALLE AND GREENHORN THUNES ROUPE TOPSIDE. WE, LIKE THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE, ARE UNBREAKABLE. Narrator: CHEAPER, BUT MORE DANGEROUS THAN EXCAVATOR BARGES, SUCTION DREDGES LIKE THE EROICA RELY ON THEIR DIVERS TO FIND AND VACUUM UP THE GOLD. [ BREATHING ] ALL RIGHT, ON BOTTOM. ALL RIGHT, 10-4. YOUR FIRST DIVE OF THE SEASON! WHAT ARE YOU SEEING DOWN THERE? UH... YEAH, BUDDY, WHOO! ARE YOU SURE? YEP, I'M RIGHT ON 'EM. YEAH-EAH! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT. SUCK IT UP! GOLD FOR DAYS. WE'RE GONNA KICK SOME ASS IN THIS SPOT. YEAH. WE WANT TO HAVE OUR BEST SEASON THIS YEAR AND EVERYTHING'S IN PLACE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. Narrator: 7 MILES WEST OF THE CITY OF NOME... IS THE REIGNING WINTER GOLD CHAMPION. I'M FEELING OPTIMISTIC. WE'RE GONNA GO OUT HERE AND, HOPEFULLY, GET ON FIRST GOLD. Narrator: WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON, EN ROUTE TO THE CROWDED TOMCOD CLAIM. LIKE, WE GOT GOOD GOLD IN THE WINTER. WE GET OUT THERE AND GET ON THE GROUND THAT WE KNOW IS GOOD, I THINK WE CAN DO IT. Narrator: THIS WINTER... Narrator: VERNON AND HIS CREW BROUGHT IN 177 OUNCES, WORTH 230 GRAND, FROM THE TOMCOD, A NEW PERSONAL BEST. DANG! WE DONE WELL. LAST WINTER, WE GOT ON GOOD GROUND AND I HAD AN EXCELLENT TEAM. ALL THAT STUFF IS STILL IN PLACE. THIS SUMMER, TO SHOW A REAL CLEARCUT PROFIT, IT'S GONNA TAKE IN THE RANGE OF 300 OUNCES. WE GOTTA KEEP THE CABIN CLEAN AND ORGANIZED. IT'S SMALL. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SPACE. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND THINGS. THINGS NEED TO STAY ORGANIZED. DAD! Narrator: BACK FOR ANOTHER ROUND, VERNON'S FIRSTBORN DAUGHTER, ELAINE. Vernon: WHEN YOU INJECT FAMILY INTO A BUSINESS SITUATION, IT'S REALLY A BAD POLICY. YOU OUGHT TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM FAMILY AS YOU CAN. BUT MY DAUGHTERS, IN PARTICULAR, I'M TRYIN' TO HELP 'EM OUT. ALL RIGHT, STAND BY. Narrator: THIS SUMMER, ELAINE'S NOT THE ONLY ADKISON DAUGHTER ONBOARD. Vernon: OKAY, LET IT GO. NOW, THAT'S PROBABLY GOT ENOUGH LINE. NOW, MAKE SOME FIGURE-8s ON THAT. Narrator: ALSO JOINING THE CREW, VERNON'S SECONDBORN, GREENHORN TENDER YVONNE. IT COULD GO THIS WAY, RATHER THAN THIS WAY, BECAUSE THERE'D BE A LITTLE GAP RIGHT THERE. ALL RIGHT? OKAY? MM-HMM. ELAINE REALLY TALKED ME INTO IT AFTER LAST WINTER. SHE MADE PRETTY GOOD MONEY, SO THAT DEFINITELY WAS A GOOD INCENTIVE FOR ME TO COME UP. FIRST DIVE OF THE SEASON! CAN'T WAIT, MAN! GET SOME GOLD! Narrator: WITH NEARLY THE ENTIRE ADKISON CLAN TENDING, THE FIRST TO HIT THE WATER IS VETERAN DIVER SHEM FOGELMAN. AAH! AH, OKAY. ♪ DO DO-DO DO-DO ALL RIGHT, BOYS, I'M GONNA HOOK IN THE NOZZLE. TRY TO FIND SOME COBBLE, OR SOMETHIN'. ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS. AHH! OH, HEY, SHEM, WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE DOWN THERE? YOU SEEIN' ANY GOLD DOWN THERE YET? NO, NOT SEEING ANY GOLD YET. WE'RE STILL LOOKING. WE'RE PROSPECTING, SO... I DON'T LIKE PROSPECTING. I LIKE PRODUCTION. Narrator: WHILE VERNON LOOKS TO PICK UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF, BACK IN NOME, AT BELMONT BEACH... HEY, SARAH? CAN I GET A HAND WITH THIS? AND JUST HOLD THIS TUBE INTO THAT LITTLE NOZZLE FOR IT. DUDE, I GOT ALL THE MONEY THAT I HAVE SUNK INTO MAKING THIS WORK, SO I'M REALLY, TOTALLY GAMBLING ALL OF MY MONEY AND NEXT MONTH'S BILLS, AND WHAT HAVE YOU, ON THERE BEIN' GOLD, AND GOOD GOLD. Narrator: 5th-YEAR MINER ZEKE TENHOFF AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, SARAH DUNN, ARE PREPPING A NEW AND IMPROVED VERSION OF ZEKE'S DREDGE, THE CLARK. Zeke: I THINK THAT ANYONE CAN SUCCEED AT DREDGING. IT'S ALWAYS A GAMBLE, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE YOU COULD GO FIND, LIKE, A REALLY, REALLY, REALLY RICH PLACE. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK ON THE BOTTOM AND GET ON SOME HOT GOLD AGAIN. YEAH, WELL, I'M STOKED. YEAH, NO, SHE RIDES GREAT. I THINK SHE'S GONNA GET A TON OF GOLD. ESPECIALLY WITH THIS DIVER, HERE. I WANT YOU TO BE LIKE "YEAH!" THAT'S RIGHT! EVERYTHING'S RUNNIN' RIGHT, FOR NOW. THIS IS AWESOME. THIS IS AWESOME. I LOVED NOME, 'TIL GLEN LeBARON CAME TO TOWN. OH, WELL. DOWN LET HIM RAIN ON YOUR PARADE. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: JUST 20 YARDS AWAY... YEAH, GET DOWN THERE AND DO THOSE NUMBERS. Narrator: ZEKE'S FORMER-PARTNER- TURNED-NEMESIS, GLEN LeBARON. HE'S GEARING UP AS WELL, WITH THE 15-FOOT MISS NOMER. Glen: AND TODAY WENT FROM BEING REALLY GOOD TO BEING NOT SO GOOD. I CAN'T DREDGE RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I'M NOT READY, BUT WE'RE GONNA BE DREDGING REALLY SOON. THIS IS THE THIRD SUMMER GLEN'S BEEN UP HERE. DUDE, I HAVEN'T LIKE SEEN LIKE THE PERFORMANCE ACTUALLY HAPPEN. Narrator: OVER THE WINTER... I THINK YOU'RE INTERMEDIATE, AT BEST, MINING EXPERIENCE, FACT. Narrator: ZEKE AND GLEN'S MINING DREAM TEAM? TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKIN' WITH YA. I DON'T REALLY EVEN CARE IF WE'RE DOING THAT, DUDE. YOU WON'T EVEN SHAKE MY HAND, I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY REASON TO SPEAK TO YOU ANYMORE. WHAT'S UP, ZEKE? HOW'S IT GOIN', GLEN? GOOD. HAVE YOU DONE THE BOUNCE TEST? YEAH, IT'S REALLY STRONG. CAN I JUST ABOARD AND LOOK AT A FEW THINGS? YEAH, FOR SURE. WHOA. BE CAREFUL, THOUGH. CAN I JUST STUMBLE ABOARD? LIKE, FOR REALS? YEAH. SO YOU GOT YOUR, UM, YOU GOT YOUR OUTBOARD AT THE RIGHT HEIGHT? MM-HMM. THOSE FRONT OUTRIGGERS, ARE YOU PRETTY CONFIDENT IN THOSE? OH, NO, YOU CAN JACK THE WHOLE THING UP. OH, OKAY. YEAH. SO I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER ICE, LIKE YOU WENT YOUR WAY, I WENT MY WAY. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DIDN'T REALLY PRODUCE A LOT OF GOLD, BUT YOU FOUND SOME GOOD LOCATIONS. NO, I FOUND AN AREA THAT LOOKS PRETTY INTERESTING, A LOT OF BIG BOULDERS, THAT KIND OF THING. MM-HMM, MM-HMM. BUT I'M REAL HOPEFUL ABOUT WHERE I'M GOIN'. BENCHMARK'S 60 OUNCES, BUT, LIKE, DUDE, THE OCEAN DOESN'T OWE ME ANYTHING, YOU KNOW. WHAT ABOUT YOU? LIKE, MAYBE 80 TO 100 OUNCES. THAT'S MY GOAL. YOU KNOW, MAYBE EVEN BETTER. OKAY. LATER, MAN. HE'S SO ADVANCED IN GOLD MINING, HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO DO IT ANYMORE. PRETTY MUCH. I REALLY WANT TO GET MORE GOLD THAN HIM. GLEN THINKS HE'S GOLD-DREDGER JESUS, AND THAT'S FINE, HE CAN THINK THAT. I THINK GLEN'S OVERCONFIDENCE AND GLEN'S EGO IS DEFINITELY GONNA WORK TO HIS DISADVANTAGE. ZEKE'S NUMBER-1 GOAL IS TO OUTDO ME IN THE GOLD COUNT, BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER ABOUT BEING A [BLEEP], JUST A HALF-ASS [BLEEP] HUMAN BEING. Narrator: AS ZEKE AND GLEN'S SUMMER RIVALRY BEGINS, ONE MILE EAST OF THE HARBOR, ON CLAIM 14... GET SOME NICE, CHUNKY GOLD UNDER HERE, BROTHER, THE KIND YOU WANT TO WRITE HOME TO YOUR MOM ABOUT. Narrator: CAPTAIN EMILY AND HER CREW ARE BACK ON THE GOLD. Emily: I JUST TURNED 26 AND I'D ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I'D BE A MOM BY NOW AND IT TURNS OUT THAT I AM, BUT MY CHILDREN, [laughs] MY CREW, THEY'RE ALL OLDER THAN ME -- GROWN MEN, TECHNICALLY, SO I FEEL LIKE A MOM OUT HERE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO! Narrator: FOR 3 HOURS, DIVER TONY MANN HAS BEEN MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME WITH THE EROICA's MIGHTY 100-HORSEPOWER ENGINE AND 10-INCH NOZZLE, STRONG ENOUGH TO EASILY PICK UP A 600-POUND BOULDER. THE WEATHER IS PERFECT. IS THIS GOING TOO WELL? WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE REACQUAINTED WITH THAT 10-INCH? CAN'T LET THAT 10-INCH WORK YOU, YOU GOTTA OWN THE 10. [ PROLONGED BEEP ] TONY, DO YOU COPY? [ BEEP CONTINUES ] SOMETHING HAPPENED TO TONY'S COMM LINE. WE LOST COMMS. TONY, TONY, TONY, COME TO THE SURFACE, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. COME TO THE SURFACE. Narrator: ON A 10-INCH DREDGE, A DOWNED COMM LINE AND AN UNRESPONSIVE DIVER MEANS RED ALERT. Emily: I TURNED OFF THE PUMP MOTOR. HE'LL COME UP. HE'LL GET COLD. HE SHOULD BE COMING UP. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... HE SHOULD BE COMING UP. Narrator: CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL HAS LOST ALL CONTACT WITH HER DIVER, TONY MANN. IT'S REALLY COLD. CAN YOU SEE HIS AIR BUBBLES? CAN YOU SEE WHERE HE IS? YEAH, HE'S BREATHING. TONY, DO YOU COPY? WE LOST COMMS, AND THEN WE WERE TUGGING LIKE HELL ON YOUR UMBILICAL AND YOU WEREN'T COMING UP. YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU LOSE SUCTION LIKE THAT AND I SHUT OFF THE PUMP MOTOR, THAT MEANS COME UP 'CAUSE WE LOST COMMS. ENH. ALL RIGHT, GOT COMMS! HE'S FINE! LET GO OF THE UMBILICAL. HE'S FINE. ALL RIGHT, DUDE, IT'S JUST THAT, IF WE LOSE COMMS, WE ASSUME THE WORST. I'LL TURN YOUR HEAT BACK ON. HE SAID HE'S FINE? HE'S FINE. HE'S BEING A LITTLE [BLEEP] ABOUT IT, THOUGH. Narrator: STAYING UNDER WHEN SIGNALED TO COME TOPSIDE IS A BREACH OF DIVE PROTOCOL. TO EMILY, IT'S ALSO A SIGN OF DISRESPECT. Emily: DAMN IT, TONY. TONY. IF YOU EVER LOSE SUCTION, YOU COME UP RIGHT AWAY, OKAY? IF YOUR LIMB GETS SUCKED IN THERE, YOU'RE DEAD. THAT'S IT, YOU'RE DEAD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS HIS PROBLEM, BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS, LIKE, SERIOUS [BLEEP], LIKE, I THOUGHT HE WAS [BLEEP] DEAD AND HE'S BEING A LITTLE [BLEEP] ABOUT IT. THAT'S REALLY UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR FROM A DIVER. Narrator: WHILE EMILY STRUGGLES TO KEEP HER BOYS IN LINE, 3 MILES TO THE WEST, JUST OUT OF PORT... FORWARD HO! BEGINNING OF THE 2014 SEASON, WE'RE HEADED OUT TO THE TOMCOD AGAIN. Narrator: WITH THEIR NEW $50,000 WASH PLANT ONBOARD... JUST TRYIN' TO GET EVERYTHING DIALED BACK IN HERE. WE'RE HEADED BACK OUT TO THE DIGGING GROUNDS. THE CHRISTINE ROSE, WITH POMRENKE FATHER AND SON, BEGINS THE QUEST FOR 1,000 OUNCES. I'VE PROSPECTED AROUND THIS AREA AND, THIS WINTER, WE WERE SEEING SOME PRETTY DECENT GOLD OVER, HEADED IN THIS DIRECTION. Narrator: THEIR CHOSEN GROUNDS? SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE'S -- THE TOMCOD CLAIM. I SEE BUOYS DROPPED EVERYWHERE. Narrator: THE NOME GOLD FLEET'S VERY OWN GRAND CENTRAL STATION. I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT THESE GUYS OR WHERE THEIR BUOYS ARE AT. I'M JUST GONNA DIG. EVERYBODY HAS GOT AUTHORIZATION TO BE OUT HERE, SO IT'S JUST A RACE, WHO GETS THE GOLD FIRST. WE GOT A LOT BIGGER DREDGES, A LOT MORE COMPETITION, THIS YEAR, AND, EVERY YEAR, IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER, BECAUSE ALL THE GOOD SPOTS ARE GETTIN' DUG UP. COMIN' BY HANK HERE. LET'S SEE IF HE'S UP AND RUNNIN', OR IF HE'S SCREWIN' AROUND, LIKE USUAL. [ HONK-HONK ] AW, MAN, YEAH, HE'S RIGHT WHERE I DUG IT ALL OUT. [ CACKLE ] I'M DIGGING IN YOUR TAILINGS, SHAWN, YEAH. "I'VE ALREADY DUG THERE. WHAT'S HE DOIN' OVER THERE, THE DUMBASS?" Shawn: NO, I JUST WANT TO GET SET UP IN AN AREA WHERE I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE SOME GOLD AND WE'RE GONNA TRY, I WANT TO TRY TO THE WASH PLANT OUT. OKAY, I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND DROP THE SPUD. Narrator: TO KEEP THE BARGE IN PLACE WHILE THEY DIG, SHAWN LOWERS THE 35-FOOT, 8,000-POUND STABILIZING SPUD. I FOUND THIS SPOT AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE COME OUT AND MARK THEIR SPOT WITH THE GPS DOESN'T MEAN IT'S THEIRS. TIME TO DO SOME TEST PANS. GOOD-LOOKIN' MATERIAL. I ALWAYS SET THAT 1,000-OUNCE GOAL UP, BUT I THINK, THIS YEAR, WE GOT A FIGHTING CHANCE TO GET THAT, AND MORE. THERE'S SOME CHUNKIES IN THERE. THERE'S GOLD HERE. LET'S RUN -- I WANT TO SEE THE PLANT GO. Narrator: WITH GOLD IN THE TEST PAN... THIS BABY'S GONNA SIFT GRAVEL, I GUARANTEE YA. Narrator: ALL THAT'S LEFT IS TO FIRE UP DAD'S NEW WASH PLANT. BEAUTIFUL! YEAH! OH, YEAH, BABY. Narrator: THE IMPROVED WASH PLANT HAS A LARGER, 5-FOOT-WIDE SCREEN DECK TO WASH MORE MATERIAL, FASTER. AS BIG ROCKS TUMBLE THROUGH AND OUT, THE WASHED DIRT ENTERS A LONGER, 50-FOOT SLUICE BOX ON A 7° ANGLE, DESIGNED TO CAPTURE MORE FINE GOLD. AS LONG AS THAT WASH PLANT WORKS, WE'RE GONNA BE IN GOOD SHAPE. YEAH! HERE WE GO! IF IT FEEDS DIRT LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO FOR THE FIRST 5 MINUTES, IT'S GONNA WORK THE REST OF THE YEAR. NOW, WE GET TO SEE IF ALL THIS HARD WORK'S GONNA PAY OFF. HERE'S THE FIRST BUCKET. THIS PLANT'S GONNA FINALLY SEE SOME GOLD. YEAH! IT EATS UP THE DIRT! IT'S 10 TIMES FASTER THAN THE OLD PLANT. THE OLD WASH PLANT, YOU HAD TO SIT THERE AND JUST SPRINKLE IT IN THERE. NOW, WE'RE JUST MOWIN'. WASH PLANT'S WORKIN', SO THAT'S GOOD. OUR PRODUCTION IS GOIN' WAY UP. I'M A HAPPY MAN. LOOK AT THIS THING. I LIKE IT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD SEASON THIS YEAR, I HAVE A FEELING. Narrator: 7 MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... AGH! WE'RE IN ABOUT THE SAME KIND OF MATERIAL AS WE WERE BEFORE WE SHIFTED AND WE STOPPED THINKING IT LOOKS GOOD. Narrator: 5 HOURS INTO HIS SHIFT, VERNON'S DIVER HAS YET TO FIND A PAY STREAK. KINDA WANNA MOVE FROM THIS SPOT. KIND OF [BLEEP]. YOU WANT US TO LET OUT SOME MORE ANCHOR RIGHT NOW, OR YOU WANT TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES, OR WHAT? I'M ABOUT READY. OKAY, WE'LL LET OUT SOME MORE. SO, JUST A TINY, LITTLE BIT OF STRAIN ON IT AND PAY IT OUT GRADUALLY. Narrator: TO COVER MORE GROUND, VERNON ORDERS HIS DAUGHTER TO GIVE SLACK ON THE FORWARD ANCHOR. YVONNE! IS IT STILL TAKING LINE? IS IT STILL TAKING LINE?! WAS THAT A YES?! YES! DON'T GET AN ATTITUDE WITH IT! THAT'S ENOUGH! YOU KNOW, JUST FOR TEMPORARY, YOU JUST THROW A FEW TURNS ON THERE, IT'S GONNA HOLD. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. WELL, YOU KNOW IT NOW. THAT'S WHY I'M TELLIN' YA NOW. SO, WE'RE NOT DONE. PAY IT OUT, PLEASE. MY DAUGHTERS, I'M TRYING TO HELP 'EM GET THEIR FEET UNDER 'EM FINANCIALLY AND GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO DO THAT MIGHT SERVE THEM WELL ON INTO THE FUTURE, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT -- IT'S DIFFICULT, IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT. YEAH, HEY, SHEM, WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE DOWN THERE? I'M PUNCHIN' A NEW HOLE. GONNA LOOK FOR SOME HOT-ASS GOLD. SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. OH, LOOK AT THAT CRUMBLY GARNET. OH, THERE'S GOLD IN IT! LOOK AT THAT! HOLY [BLEEP]! ARE THOSE HAPPY SOUNDS I HEAR COMIN' FROM DOWN THERE? IT'S LOOKIN' REALLY GOOD DOWN THERE. SHEM'S EXCITED AND IT TAKES A DECENT AMOUNT OF GOLD TO GET HIM GOING, SO, GOTTA GET THAT, GOTTA GET THAT GOLD, MAN! THAT'S THE MOST POSITIVE NEWS I'VE HEARD, LATELY. BEING ON GOLD, EVEN IF IT'S FINE GOLD, IS A LOT DAMN BETTER THAN NOT BEING ON GOLD. Narrator: 7 MILES TO THE EAST, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOME... HERE WE GO. Narrator: ONE OF THE LAST TEAMS TO GET UNDERWAY... MOVIN' THE REAPER, FINALLY GETTING INTO THE WATER. Narrator: BRAD KELLY'S FAMILY-RUN CHOP-SHOP DREDGE, THE REAPER. 'CAUSE THE BOAT'S ON THE GROUND, SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LIFT IT OFF THE GROUND AND TRY AND GET IT ONTO THE TRAILER WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE. Kris: ♪ DO-DO DO-DO [CHUCKLE] IT'S ALWAYS AN EXCITING ADVENTURE, EVERY SINGLE MORNING, DOING THIS [BLEEP]. Narrator: THIS WINTER... Narrator: DESPITE A CHEAP OPERATION... AAH! WHAT A PIECE OF [BLEEP]. I TOOK 50% OUT OF YOU GUYS' 1,500 BUCKS. Narrator: THEIR FATHER, CAPTAIN BRAD'S, STICKY FINGERS... HERE'S 700. I DON'T HAVE ANY CHANGE. STOP [BLEEP] OUR DREDGING MONEY AWAY ON YOUR NEW FAMILY. Narrator: AND THE CONSTANT DISTRACTION OF FAMILY DIVORCE... YOU DIVE 4 MORE HOURS A DAY, AND THAT'LL PICK UP THE SLACK. Narrator: THE KELLYS FOUGHT THEIR WAY TO A 33-OUNCE, $43,000 SCORE. AND THERE'S THE PART YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR. YEAH, THAT'S THE REAL DEAL. Narrator: COME SUMMER, BRAD NEEDS TO MAKE MORE GOLD THAN EVER BEFORE. I MET A NEW WOMAN IN NOME. THE BABY'S DUE OCTOBER 7th. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE OLD FAMILY, I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE NEW FAMILY, I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY. FOR BRAD'S SON KRIS, DAD'S NEW BUN IN THE OVEN IS NOT EXACTLY A BUNDLE OF JOY. OUR WHOLE FAMILY'S IN SHAMBLES RIGHT NOW. WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER. MY DAD'S HAVING A NEW KID WITH A-[BLEEP]-NOTHER LADY. WORKING WITH MY BROTHER, YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME WE GET GOLD MONEY, WE SEND MY MOM MONEY. WHOA! THAT'S IT! IT'S GOOD! OH, IT'S A SUCCESS. LET'S GET THIS THING IN THE WATER. Narrator: WHILE BRAD AND KRIS HEAD FOR THE BOAT LAUNCH... Brad: AND HE NEVER SHOWS UP WHEN THERE'S WORK, DUDE. HE'LL GET OUT TO PLAY WHEN IT'S DONE. Narrator: 2 MILES AWAY, IN THE HEART OF NOME... I JUST HATE THIS [BLEEP] TOWN. Narrator: PLEASANT AS EVER, THE YOUNGEST KELLY, ANDY, HAS JUST HIT TOWN. I GOT OFF THE PLANE THIS MORNING. I WAS KINDA CONTRADICTING IF I WAS GONNA COME BACK FOR THE SEASON, 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY MUCH SICK OF EVERYTHING. COME ON! I GET SCREWED OVER ON THE MONEY, I GET SCREWED OVER ON THE GOLD CLEANOUT. MY DAD EXPECTS US TO GET OUT THERE AND DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN FOR HIM, TO MAKE HIM MONEY, AND ALL HE DOES IS JUST SCREW ME OVER AND I'M TIRED OF IT. I'M NOT HERE TO MINE WITH MY BROTHER AND MY DAD. I'M GONNA WREAK CHAOS ON EVERYBODY NOW. IT'S MY ONE MAIN GOAL FOR BEING HERE. Narrator: AFTER WINTER, GETTING SHORTCHANGED BY HIS DAD, ANDY IS PLOTTING A COUP. I KNOW THE GUY THAT OWNS THE REAPER.

Narrator: CONSPIRING WITH HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS PARTNER, ANDY IS HOPING TO BUY THE BOAT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIS POPS.
