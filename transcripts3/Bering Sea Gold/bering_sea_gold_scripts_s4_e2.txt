 IT COME IN AT, LIKE, 3:00 IN THE MORNING. Narrator: HIGH SEAS AND 35-KNOT WINDS ARE KEEPING FORTUNE HUNTERS OFF THE GOLD. IT'S 3- TO 4- TO 5-FOOT ROLLERS THUMPING INTO THE BEACH. AND IT JUST GOT THE BOTTOM ALL TURNED TO HELL AND BACK. Narrator: AS MOST CREWS HUNKER DOWN, TWO MILES EAST OF THE HARBOR... Emily: HOLD ON, EROICA, WE'RE COMING. Narrator: ...SOPHOMORE SKIPPER EMILY RIEDEL WAS CAUGHT SLEEPING, LEAVING HER DREDGE, THE EROICA, ANCHORED AS THE STORM BLEW IN. IT'S GONNA BE A FUN, LITTLE PARK JOB. Narrator: WITH OVER $200,000 INVESTED, EMILY NEEDS TO GET IT BACK TO SHORE FAST. COMING IN HOT. OH [BLEEP] DAMN IT. [BLEEP] IT'S [BLEEP] UP OUR MOTOR. JUST GET THE ROPE OFF THAT CLEAT. AND GET ON BOARD AND PULL IT FORWARDS. WHEW. DAMN, DUDE. LET'S JUST HOP ON BOARD. HOP ON BOARD. WE GOT TO MOVE THE NOZZLE BEFORE I FIRE IT UP. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAUL ASS 'CAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GET WORSE. FIRST, I GOT TO GET THE HOSE UP. THAT WAS THE LINE IT WAS ON. THAT IS THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN. THE NOZZLE LINE ATTACHED TO OUR DREDGING HOSE IS BROKEN. THE HOSE DIDN'T BREAK OFF, DID IT? NO, SHE'S STILL THERE. SHE'S AIMING TOTALLY THE WRONG WAY. Narrator: THE SWELLS HAVE SNAPPED THE LINE SECURING THE NOZZLE OF THE SUCTION HOSE, LEAVING IT TOSSING IN THE SEA BELOW. IF IT IS THAT HOSE, IT'S GONNA BE A MAJOR CATASTROPHE. IT MIGHT BE POTENTIALLY BETTER TO LET HER WEATHER THE STORM. SORRY, DARYL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DIVE. HMM, OKAY. DESPITE ROUGH CONDITIONS, EMILY ORDERS DARYL VALLE INTO THE BERING SEA TO SECURE THE HOSE AND RIG THE BOAT FOR TRAVEL. STAND BY FOR COM CHECK. COM CHECK, HOW DO YOU COPY? I HAVE YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. ALL RIGHT, COPY THAT. YOU'RE TAKING ONE FOR THE TEAM. HOW YOU DOING? THE CURRENT'S PRETTY RIPPING RIGHT NOW. WHOA. WELL, LET'S HOPE I CAN HANG ON TO THE HOSE. ALL RIGHT. YEAH, THE NOZZLE SEEMS TO BE BROKEN APART WHERE THE ROPE WAS CONNECTED TO IT, BUT I GOT IT HOOKED UP NOW. SO WE CAN HURRY UP AND PULL IT UP. ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT ME TO COME UP ON THE OTHER ROPE NOW? YES. OKAY, COPY THAT. WE JUST -- WE JUST -- WE -- WE JUST GOT THROUGH ONE MAJOR [BLEEP] CATASTROPHE. [ GRUNTS ] YOU GOT IT? BACK UP. GET IT AROUND. ALL RIGHT, THANKS. BRING US HOME. WE'RE IN. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED LAST YEAR, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD, LIKE, A MENTAL BREAKDOWN. YOU'RE DOING WELL WITH HANDLING IT. I'M PROUD OF YOU. YOU DIDN'T EVEN GO OFF OR NOTHING. IT WAS GOOD. YOU GET BROKEN IN UP HERE OR YOU GET BROKEN. WE MUST BE BROKEN IN. I THINK SO. BETTER BROKEN IN THAN BROKEN. Narrator: AS THE EROICA FINALLY HEADS FOR PORT, BACK IN TOWN... WHO, ANDY? BRETT: Yes. REAPER OWNER BRAD KELLY HAS RECEIVED AN URGENT PHONE CALL FROM HIS BUSINESS PARTNER. THREE DAYS AGO... I KNOW THE GUY THAT OWNS THE REAPER. HE WANTS TO BE BOUGHT OUT, SO I TALKED TO HIM AND TOLD HIM, "EH [BLEEP] I'LL TAKE IT ALL." Narrator: BRAD'S SON, ANDY, ARRIVED IN TOWN WITH A PLOT TO BUY THE DREDGE RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIS DAD... Andy: HE [BLEEP] OVER OUR FAMILY FOR A NEW FAMILY AND LEFT MY MOTHER WITH NOTHING. BUT FIGURE I'M GONNA LEAVE HIM WITH THE SAME -- NOTHING. Narrator: ...A PLAN THAT HAS NOW BEEN EXPOSED BY ANDY'S CO-CONSPIRATOR. YEAH, YEAH, NO, I'M GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME THAT. I'LL CALL YOU TONIGHT, BRO. OKAY, BYE. I GUESS ANDY AND MY WIFE ARE TRYING TO SCREW ME OVER, TRYING TO TAKE MY BOAT FROM ME. THAT'S MAMA'S BOY. SEE, I LEFT MY WIFE THIS YEAR. WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS MARRIED FOR 37 YEARS, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. AND I'M NOT SAYING -- I'M A CATHOLIC, THAT I WOULD HAVE STAYED MARRIED FOR 100 YEARS. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE SERVING A PRISON SENTENCE SOMETIMES. I JUST DON'T WANT THAT LIFE ANYMORE. Narrator: LEAVING HIS FIRST WIFE AND EXPECTING A CHILD WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, BRAD'S NEW LIFE IS AT ODDS WITH THE OLD ONE. BRAD, WHEN ARE YOU REALLY GONNA DRAW THE LINE LIKE YOU SAY? 'CAUSE THEY'RE MY KIDS, SO I HAVE TO KEEP GIVING THEM ANOTHER CHANCE. THEY'RE MY KIDS. WHEN DO YOU STOP GIVING YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR FAMILY, ANOTHER CHANCE? WHEN DOES THAT ACTUALLY COME? I LIKE TO SAY IT AND PUT THE FEAR OF GOD INTO THEM AND THINK THAT DAD'S SICK OF IT. THEN THAT PUTS THE WEIGHT ON YOUR SHOULDERS AND ALL THE STRESS. AND THEN, GUESS WHERE THE STRESS GETS RUBBED OFF ON? THIS NEW FAMILY HERE. WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THEY'RE MY KIDS, SO I ALWAYS HAVE TO FORGIVE THEM. YOU'RE CAPTAIN, OKAY? I KNOW YOU'RE NEW TO THIS CAPTAIN AND EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW, YOU SAY YOU'VE OWNED BUSINESSES BEFORE. HOW DID YOU OPERATE THOSE BUSINESSES? I DON'T USE MY FAMILY. THAT'S HOW. I COULD TALK THIS [BLEEP] TO EVERYBODY ELSE, AND I COULD MAKE THEM DO IT. AND IT'S BETTER WHEN YOU WORK WITH STRANGERS SOMETIMES. BUT, WITH THE KIDS, THEY THINK THEY CAN WALK ALL OVER ME, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO THEN, IT'S UP TO YOU TO CORRECT THAT. MY KIDS' ATTITUDES, THEY'RE -- I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, THEY'RE A LITTLE -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE HEARTBROKEN OR WHAT THEY ARE. BUT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THAT I CAUSE A LOT OF CHAOS IN THE FAMILY. ANDY, HE'LL PROBABLY NEVER GET OVER IT. YOU KNOW, HE'S STARTED A WAR WHERE HE'S PUT HIMSELF IN PRETTY DEEP. THESE KIDS -- SEE, A LOT OF PARENTS HAVE [BLEEP] UP KIDS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THEY'RE NOT REALLY [BLEEP] UP. THEY COULD BE DRUG ADDICTS. THEY COULD BE A LOT OF [BLEEP] THEY'RE JUST MISGUIDED YOUTH, I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW. Narrator: SIX MILES OUTSIDE NOME.... THE OCEAN'S BEEN GREAT TO US AND EVERYTHING, BUT I NEED TO GO INLAND MINING FOR ME. IT'S WHAT I GREW UP ON. IT'S WHAT I LOVE TO DO. Narrator: ...62-YEAR-OLD CHRISTINE ROSE CO-OWNER STEVE POMRENKE IS SCRATCHING AN OLD ITCH. AND NOW THAT THIS CHRISTINE ROSE IS ALL UP AND RUNNING UP TO SNUFF, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO STEP ASIDE, LET SHAWN TAKE THAT OVER, AND MOVE ON TO WHAT I WANT TO DO. AND THAT'S INLAND MINING. ONLY 25 MINUTES LATE. Narrator: FOR YEARS... IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE AT 2:00, BE HERE AT 2:00. OKAY. OKAY. ...STEVE HAS BEEN PUSHING HIS SON TO STEP UP AND TAKE OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS. WELL, THEN, YOU TAKE CARE ALL OF THE [BLEEP] I'M TAKING CARE OF. I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE TALKING [BLEEP] ABOUT ME TO OTHER PEOPLE. BECAUSE WE CAN TALK [BLEEP] ABOUT YOU BECAUSE YOU GIVE US SO MUCH AMMUNITION. Steve: 52.3 NOW, WITH SHAWN AND THE BARGE CONSISTENTLY PRODUCING GOLD... YAY. ...THE OLD MAN IS LOOKING TO RETURN TO HIS ROOTS. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. Steve: DOWN THE HILL HERE IS ANVIL -- MINED AND MINED AGAIN. BUT THERE'S STILL POCKETS OF GOLD OUT THERE THE OLD TIMERS DIDN'T FIND. AND WHEN YOU DO FIND THEM, THEY ARE SUPER RICH. Narrator: STEVE IS HEADED TO THE SCENE OF THE ORIGINAL NOME GOLD RUSH -- THE TRIBUTARIES OF ANVIL CREEK. ANVIL CREEK HAS POPPED OUT 12 OF THE BIGGEST NUGGETS FOUND IN ALASKA -- ALL FROM ANVIL HERE. THIS PLACE HAS SUPER GOLD-MINING HISTORY. I'VE COME TO GET A SAMPLE, MAN. I GOT A GOOD SAMPLE OVER THERE, DUDE. THAT'S WHERE I WAS HEADED. I DIDN'T CARE IF YOU WERE HERE OR NOT. I WAS GONNA GET A SAMPLE. Narrator: TO HELP HIM FIND GOOD GROUND, STEVE IS WORKING WITH LOCAL PROSPECTOR AUGGIE CRUTCH. Steve: OLD-TIME MINER HERE -- GOOD OLD FRIEND. HE'S ENTHUSED ABOUT FINDING GOLD. THAT'S AUGGIE. STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN? WELL, I'M HITTING IT RIGHT ON THE BANK THERE. AND THEN IT JUST DROPS RIGHT OFF. STRAIGHT DOWN AT THIS ANGLE. YEAH, RIGHT ABOUT THERE'S WHERE PAY STOPS -- OR STARTS. AND THEN IT JUST DROPS IN RIGHT HERE. THE DREDGE WENT THROUGH HERE. BUT IT DIDN'T COME UP, YOU KNOW? THERE'S BANKS -- SOME OF THE BANK HERE -- WELL, THIS HERE LOOKS LIKE DREDGE TAILINGS HERE. IT DOES, BUT... THERE'S, UH, THEY LEFT -- IT'S UNTURNED. SO ANYWAY... YEAH, YEAH. THIS PLACE IS JUST A WONDERLAND FOR GOLD. Narrator: FOR MUCH OF THE 20th CENTURY, MASSIVE LAND DREDGES TORE THROUGH THESE CREEK BEDS, PRODUCING MORE THAN 3 MILLION OUNCES OF GOLD. TODAY... Steve: OLD GUYS CAN'T BEND SO EASY. Narrator: ...THE TRICK IS TO FIND A PLACE THE LAND DREDGES MISSED. HOLY CRAP, MAN. HOLY CRAP. THERE'S GOLD IN THIS PAN, DUDE. I GET A KICK OUT OF THIS GROUND. THIS IS WAY DIFFERENT THAN THE OCEAN GROUND. IT PANS WAY DIFFERENT. THERE'S A HUGE NUGGET IN HERE FOR PANNING. THAT'S A LOT OF NICE GOLD OUT OF ONE PAN OF DIRT. THAT'S A ROUGH-LOOKING NUGGET, BUT THAT'S WHAT ANVIL'S KNOWN FOR. THEY'RE ROUGH-LOOKING. YEAH, STRAIGHT FROM THE SOURCE. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE OCEAN -- BUFFETED IT AROUND, POLISHED OFF. THIS IS WHERE IT ALL CAME FROM. THIS IS WHERE IT ALL CAME FROM. YEAH, THIS IS THE HEADWATERS RIGHT HERE. RIGHT HERE. YEP. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, AIN'T IT? HELL YEAH. YEAH, MAN. OH, MAN, LOOK AT THAT CHUNK. THAT'S A NICE-SIZED CHUNK. [ LAUGHING ] STRIKING GOLD INLAND, ONLY ONE THING REMAINS FOR STEVE... Steve: GOING INLAND IS THE ONLY VIABLE OPTION 'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY THING I REALLY KNOW HOW TO DO IN MY LIFE. SHAWN CAN STICK TO THE OCEAN. THAT'S WHAT HE KNOWS BEST. Narrator: ...CONVINCING HIS SON TO BANKROLL THE OPERATION. I DON'T KNOW HOW SHAWN'S GONNA TAKE THIS CONVERSATION, BUT HE'S GONNA HAVE TO ACCEPT IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. I'M THE OLD MAN. I ALWAYS WIN. Narrator: IN NOME, AS THE SUMMER'S FIRST STORM FADES AWAY... WEATHER WILLING, HEAD OUT THERE AND WE'LL START DOING SOME DIVING. Narrator: ...THE MINING FLEET HAS ITS FIRST OPPORTUNITY IN DAYS TO GET SOME GOLD. I HOPE THAT IT STAYS NICE LIKE THIS. I REALLY DO. Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF THE HARBOR, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... YEAH, FORWARD, FORWARD. Narrator: ...FIRST ONES BACK ON THE BERING SEA... NOBODY ELSE IS OUT HERE BUT THE CHRISTINE ROSE. Narrator: ...SHAWN POMRENKE AND THE 80-FOOT CHRISTINE ROSE, RISKING THE LINGERING SWELLS TO GET A JUMP ON THE COMPETITION. THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET 1,000 OUNCES IS IF I KEEP DIRT GOING THROUGH THAT PLANT. AND I'M GONNA MAKE MY GOAL THIS YEAR. IF I GOT TO PUSH IT A LITTLE HARDER THAN ANY OTHER YEAR, THIS IS THE YEAR I'M GONNA DO IT. Narrator: WITH MORE MINERS THAN EVER CROWDING THE TOMCOD CLAIM THIS SEASON, SHAWN WILL TAKE ANY ADVANTAGE HE CAN GET. I DON'T SEE HANK OUT. MUST BE SLEEPING IN. HE THINKS HE'S GONNA KEEP UP WITH ME. I'M GONNA ANNIHILATE HIM. I'M GONNA DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE GOLD COUNT ON ALL THE OTHER DREDGES COMBINED. Narrator: SHAWN'S GREATEST WEAPONS? 15 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND A GPS FILLED WITH HOT SPOTS. RIGHT NOW, I'M POSITIONING THE DREDGE WHERE WE GOT A BUNCH OF NUGGETS. WE'RE GETTING BACK INTO THE NUGGET PATCH. NUGGETS MEANS A LOT OF FINE GOLD, A LOT OF FINE GOLD MEANS A LOT OF MONEY. YEAH, KEEP GOING. BACK TO PUTTING DIRT IN THE BOX. OKAY, LET'S GET THIS [BLEEP] RUNNING -- $2,000 AN HOUR. WE'RE DIGGING. OH, LOOK AT THAT STUFF. OH, THERE'S BIG ROCKS ALL THE WAY. BIG ROCKS, BIG GOLD. I'VE HEARD DAD SAY, "BIG ROCKS, BIG GOLD," ALL THE TIME, SO MAYBE WE'LL FILL THIS BOX UP WITH A BUNCH OF BIG NUGGETS. Narrator: A VETERAN MINER, SHAWN'S STRATEGY IS TO SET UP THE BARGE ON AN AREA WITH PATCHES OF BIG BOULDERS, AND WORK DOWN INTO THE HARDPAN CLAY. THE GOLD LIKES TO HIDE AROUND THOSE BIG ROCKS. THOSE BIG ROCKS DON'T MOVE ANYWHERE SO IT CREATES A PLACE FOR THE GOLD TO HIDE. Shawn: OH, I LIKE THE WAY THIS STUFF IS SOUNDING. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SUPPORT DAD'S MINING ADDICTION. Narrator: IF HIS OLD MAN'S INLAND MINING DREAM IS GOING TO COME TRUE, THE STARTUP COSTS WILL HAVE TO COME FROM SHAWN'S HARD WORK. PRETTY NERVOUS ABOUT THE INLAND MINING. DAD SEEMS TO FORGET HOW TOUGH TIMES WERE THE LAST TIME HE INLAND MINED. HE KEPT DIGGING IN A PIT THAT NEVER PRODUCED. THAT'S A SCARY THING. YOU COULD END UP BEING A GOLD MINER. YOU COULD END UP BEING HOMELESS -- ONE BAD YEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHY IN THE HELL HE WANTS TO START A WHOLE NEW OPERATION FOR WHEN THIS OPERATION'S WORKING JUST FINE. Narrator: WITH SHAWN KEEPING THE FAMILY BUSINESS ON THE GOLD, SEVEN MILES TO THE EAST, IN THE CITY OF NOME... SHAWN THINKS I DON'T DO NOTHING WHEN HE'S OUT THERE DIGGING. ALL DAY TODAY, I'VE BEEN DOING ALL THE ODDBALL STUFF, LIKE GETTING THE MECHANIC'S TRUCK BACK TO THE YARD, GETTING THE CRANE BACK TO THE YARD, GETTING THE PAINTING TRUCK BACK TO THE YARD, AND PICKING UP ALL THE GARBAGE, AND PICKING UP ALL THE EQUIPMENT. Narrator: ...SHAWN'S DAD, STEVE POMRENKE... Steve: YEAH, I SEE A BUNCH OF WHITECAPS OUT THERE. I DON'T SEE THE CHRISTINE ROSE IN SIGHT, SO SHE AIN'T COMING BACK IN. SHE'S OUT THERE. [ CAR HORN BEEPS ] HEY. Narrator: ALSO STILL IN PORT, THE POMRENKE FAMILY'S WOULD-BE RIVAL, AU GRABBER OWNER HANK SCHIMSCHAT. LOOKS LIKE THE CHRISTINE ROSE IS GETTING THEIR ASS KICKED OUT THERE. THEY ARE NOT. IT AIN'T THAT BAD. GO LOOK AT THE ROLLERS. I'M LOOKING AT THEM. THEY'RE NOT ROLLING THAT BAD. SO YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT, BUT, NOW, YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND FOR A LITTLE BIT? WELL, IT'S BLOWING, I MEAN, YEAH. IT'S WHITE CAPPING. THERE'S SOME PRETTY GOOD SURF COMING IN. WHAT? THAT'S A BIG WORD. YEAH. WHEN THEY... WHEN THEY FORM THAT -- WHEN THEY -- DOES THAT MEAN BAD WIND FOR DREDGERS? WINDS ALOFT. THAT MEANS THE WIND'S BLOWING, HIGH PRESSURE. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'VE BEEN BUSIER THAN A CAT SCRATCHING [BLEEP] ON A HOT TIN ROOF TODAY. OKAY, BUDDY, HAVE A GOOD DAY, MY FRIEND. Steve: WELL, HANK SAYS THAT, YEAH, THEY'RE PRETTY BAD, BUT I DON'T SEE THE BIG ROLLERS. I JUST SEE A -- IT'S A SMALLER CHOP. I'M NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT IT. Narrator: THE POMRENKES AREN'T THE ONLY ONES GAMBLING THAT THE COAST IS CLEAR. OVER ON BELMONT BEACH... Zeke: MAIDEN VOYAGES ARE ALWAYS TENSE FOR ME. IT'S LOOKING LIKE IT'S, LIKE, CHOPPY AS HELL. BUT I MEAN IF IT'S MANAGEABLE, THEN GO FOR IT. Narrator: THE FIRST DIVER DREDGE TO PULL THE TRIGGER AFTER THE STORM, THE NEWLY-UPGRADED CLARK WITH OWNERS ZEKE TENHOFF AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, SARAH DUNN. WE'LL SEE. I MEAN, WHEN WE GET OUT THERE, GET ON THE WATER, REALLY SEE HOW MUCH CHOP WE CAN HANDLE. I PUT A LOT OF TIME AND PRETTY MUCH ALL THE MONEY THAT I HAD INTO MAKING MY DREDGE AS SEAWORTHY AS I COULD SO THAT I COULD GO OUT IN ROUGHER WEATHER. I MEAN, THAT'S WHY I DID IT. SO IF I DON'T GO OUT IN EVERY WEATHER WINDOW I CAN, IT'S LIKE, "WHAT AM I DOING, SPINNING MY WHEELS?" BLOW THIS POPSICLE STAND. WHOO! Zeke: YEAH, IT'S GREAT. Narrator: ZEKE IS RETURNING TO A FAVORED HOT SPOT -- THE ROCKWALL CLAIM. THIS IS ABOUT WHERE I LEFT OFF LAST WINTER. Narrator: THE ROCKWALL CLAIM IS A 160-ACRE PRIVATE LEASE, LOCATED FIVE MILES WEST OF THE CITY OF NOME. JUST TWO MILES FROM THE CROWDED TOMCOD CLAIM, THIS GROUND IS MOSTLY UNEXPLORED. TO THE EAST SIDE OF THIS LEASE, THERE'S A TON OF HUGE ROCKS. THE BEST GOLD THAT I'VE SEEN HERE COLLECTS RIGHT AT THE FOOT OF THIS ROCK WALL. Zeke: BACK IN THE WATER! WHAT YOU LOOKING AT DOWN THERE? I DON'T KNOW. VISIBILITY ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT, SO IT'S DISORIENTING DOWN HERE. Narrator: IN THE WAKE OF A STORM, BERING SEA SWELLS KICK UP SILT FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR, DROPPING VISIBILITY TO JUST TWO FEET. WHERE I LEFT OFF IS ON THE EDGE OF THIS ROCK WALL. LUCKY FOR ZEKE... ACTUALLY, I FOUND THE EDGE OF THIS BIG ROCK PILE. VERY GOOD NEWS. ...HE'S LOOKING FOR A BIG TARGET. THERE'S, LIKE, THIS PENINSULA OF BIG ROCKS THAT GOES STRAIGHT OUT TO THE SOUTH HERE. AND, LIKE, SEE, IT GOES WAY UP. JUST DIGGING A LITTLE HOLE RIGHT NOW. IS ALL THAT GOLD STILL THERE? YEAH, I'M SEEING GOLD UNDER HERE, RIGHT ON THE EDGE, RIGHT WHERE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. REALLY? YEAH, THERE'S GOOD GOLD OUT HERE. IT'S HERE, DUDE. THAT'S FANTASTIC. WHAT A GREAT WAY TO START, HUH? THE GOLD'S REALLY F'ing GOOD. THERE'S LOTS OF LITTLE PIECES. Narrator: AT BELMONT BEACH... PREPPING FOR THE FIRST LAUNCH OF THE SUMMER... Brad: WELL, YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW, I HAD A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH MY BUDDY, BRETT. AND HE JUST SAID THAT ANDY'S OUT TO TRY AND SCREW ME IN THE BACK. Narrator: REAPER OWNER BRAD KELLY, ALONG WITH HIS SON, KRIS, HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS WITH KRIS' BROTHER, ANDY. Kris: REALLY, YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW I SEE IT? BRETT WAS TRYING TO GET ANDY TO [BLEEP] YOU OVER. YEAH. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT [BLEEP] HAPPENED. BRETT WAS TRYING TO HUSTLE ANDY. ANDY'S NOT SMART ENOUGH TO DO IT. [BLEEP] EVERYTHING WENT DOWN IN FLAMES. Kris: MY DAD WAS VERY HARD ON MY BROTHER WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP BECAUSE HE'S STUBBORN. I'VE TAKEN CARE OF MY BROTHER ALL OF MY LIFE, SINCE WE'VE BEEN ADULTS. IF I DON'T TAKE CARE OF HIM, I REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA WIND UP IN JAIL DOING SOME STUPID [BLEEP] HE'S EASILY LED ASTRAY BY PEOPLE. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL, THERE HE IS. Brad: YOU WERE ALREADY TRYING TO CONSPIRE TO TAKE MY BOAT TWO WEEKS AGO. NO, ACTUALLY BRETT CAME AND ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO BUY IT. I TOLD YOU THAT'S THE WAY IT [BLEEP] WAS, TOO. HE CALLED THIS MORNING. YEAH? I TOLD YOU IT WAS BRETT THAT TRIED TO ORCHESTRATE EVERYTHING. HE SAID YOU AND MOM WERE TRYING TO TAKE THE BOAT. HE CALLED ME AND ASKED ME IF I WANTED IT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GIVING HIM ANY MONEY. I TOLD YOU THAT'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING. ANDY WOULDN'T TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THIS WHOLE THING. YEAH, NO, NO, I DON'T CARE. I'M JUST SAYING, IF YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE, I CAN'T WORK WITH YOU THIS YEAR. I WANT YOU TO COME AND WORK, AND IT'D BE CLEAN, JUST LIKE GOING TO WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. TAKE MY ASS HOME. I'M DONE. ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU SURE, BUDDY? I'M DONE. YOU CAN GO [BLEEP] YOURSELF. YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THIS BEAUTIFUL GOLD? I'M GONNA GET GOLD MYSELF. SO TAKE ME THE [BLEEP] HOME NOW. BUT I TALKED WITH BRETT THIS MORNING. HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO SEE HOW FAR YOU WERE GONNA GO TO [BLEEP] YOUR FATHER. I'M DONE. WHY? DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT MONEY AND GOLD? I'M DONE, MAN. I'LL GO GET THE GOLD MYSELF. I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT IT. Andy: I FINALLY WANT TO GET AWAY FROM UNDER MY FATHER FOR WHAT HE DID TO MY MOTHER. HE WAS DATING THIS CHICK FOR A YEAR WITHOUT TELLING MY MOTHER ANYTHING. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLS TO EXPLAIN IT TO MY MOM, LIKE, "HEY, I'M DONE WITH YOU. I GOT A NEW FAMILY GOING ON." I'M SO [BLEEP] DONE. THREE YEARS WITH YOU, YEAH, I'M DONE. I'VE JUST HAD IT. Brad: I HAD MY BOYS AT 17. I WASN'T REALLY AWARE OF HOW TO RAISE CHILDREN, SO I RAISED MY KIDS LIKE MY FRIENDS KIND OF. SO WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO WHERE MY KIDS LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M THEIR BROTHER SOMETIMES. AND THEY OVERSTEP THEIR BOUNDARIES. THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK AND GO AND COME BACK. THEY'VE DONE THIS 100 TIMES. HE'LL COME CRAWLING ACROSS THE STREET. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? GOOD. YEAH. I HOPE YOU TAKE THAT MONEY AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR [BLEEP] YOU GOT A NEW KID AND A NEW FAMILY, SO YOU NEED THE MONEY FOR THAT [BLEEP] YEAH, ANY TIME. [BLEEP] YOU. GOOD RIDDANCE TO [BLEEP] BAD NEWS, BRO. Narrator: WITH THE KELLY FAMILY FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS, FIVE MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE ROCKWALL CLAIM... HEY, BABY, CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? HOW ARE YOU FEELING? Zeke: EVERYTHING'S FEELING GOOD. IT'S GETTING PRETTY ROCKY. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS DOWN THERE. TOO LEGIT TO QUIT! Narrator: FOR SEVEN HOURS, CLARK OWNER ZEKE TENHOFF HAS BEEN FIGHTING LOW VIS AND CHOPPY WATER TO STAY ON THE GOLD. OOH. THESE PONTOONS ARE REALLY -- THAT FRONT OF THE BOAT IS TAKING A LOT OF FLEXING. IT'S GETTING ROUGH UP THERE. WHOA. YEAH, WE'RE GETTING A SET OF SWELLS NOW. I'M GETTING JERKED AROUND. GOT TO GET AS MUCH WORK DONE AS I CAN IN BETWEEN SETS OF SWELLS. Narrator: TETHERED TO THE TINY CLARK BY AN UMBILICAL, 185 POUNDS, ZEKE IS NO MATCH FOR WAVES. DUDE, MY HOSE IS GETTING [BLEEP] YANKED. AH. YEAH, IT'S GETTING ALMOST TOO ROUGH FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE NOZZLE. WHOA. YEAH, SARAH. SARAH, I'M FEELING LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW. AH. MY STOMACH DOESN'T FEEL VERY GOOD. IT CREEPS UP ON YOU. IT'S THESE LONG, SLOW ROLLING SWELLS THAT ARE REALLY -- THAT ARE THE WORST. YOU REALLY FEELING THAT SICK? THE SWELL IS REALLY GETTING TO ME. IT'S REALLY GIVING ME MOTION SICKNESS. I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA THROW UP. ZEKE, YOU WANT TO COME UP? THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE, OKAY? DOESN'T MATTER HOW SICK AND TERRIBLE I FEEL. WHEN I SEE A REALLY GOOD SPOT AND I SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PIECES OF GOLD, I'M LIKE, "OH, YES." I WANT MY FIRST CLEANUP TO BE AS GOOD AS IT CAN POSSIBLY BE. I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO STOP. [ RETCHING ] HONEY? Narrator: FIVE MILES WEST OF NOME, AT THE CLARK... [ RETCHING ] Sarah: HONEY? [ RETCHES ] Narrator: THE ONLY DIVER BRAVING THE CHOPPY BERING SEA, ZEKE TENHOFF, IS GAINING GOLD... ...BUT LOSING HIS LUNCH. [ RETCHES ] I'M NOT CLEANING THE VOMIT OUT OF HIS MASK. AT THE NOSE AREA, THERE'S, LIKE, A ZONE THAT'S SEPARATED FROM YOUR EYE AREA. SO THEN YOU JUST GOT TO RINSE IT OUT AND FLUSH IT OUT. THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY GOOD. UH... DAMN IT. I GOT TO COME UP. AT THIS POINT, THIS IS NOT DREDGABLE. OKAY. OH, MY. SORRY. THAT'S OKAY. IT'S THESE SETS OF SWELLS THAT KIND OF COME BY AND JUST PULL EVERYTHING BACK AND FORTH. IT JUST MAKES YOU -- MAKES YOU REAL NAUSEOUS. I'LL FEEL MUCH HAPPIER ONCE THE NAUSEA GOES AWAY. MAYBE YOU SHOULD SIT OUTSIDE THAT WAY. IF YOU NEED TO PUKE, YOU CAN JUST, LIKE, THROW UP, YOU KNOW? YEAH, SOME FRESH AIR WOULD BE NICE. STARE AT THE HORIZON. [ RETCHES ] OKAY. [ RETCHES ] Narrator: AFTER A FULL SHIFT BEING TOSSED AROUND BY THE WAVES... WE JUST GOT TO MOTOR BACK TO THE SHORE. ...ZEKE FINALLY THROWS IN THE TOWEL. [ RETCHES ] TWO MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... ...AFTER 8 HOURS DIGGING THROUGH THE SWELLS... Shawn: OH, I CAN SEE THE GOLD FROM HERE. Narrator: ...SHAWN POMRENKE HAS THE CHRISTINE ROSE SQUARELY ON PAY DIRT. Shawn: WE'RE GONNA DO A CUT, MAKE SURE WE'RE LOADED. I THINK WE'RE GONNA TURN THE BOX YELLOW. Man: SEEMS TO BE WORKING OUT SO FAR. LOOKS LIKE IT'S RUNNING REALLY GOOD. HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING HOLDS TOGETHER, WE DON'T RIP THE HULL APART AND SINK OR BEND THE SPOT AND GET STUCK OUT HERE. THIS MATERIAL'S LOOKING AWESOME. EVERY BUCKET I PUT IN THIS WASH PLANT'S PAYING THE BILLS. WELL, I THINK IT'D PROBABLY AVERAGE OUT TO ABOUT $50 A BUCKET. SO IF WE CAN JUST KEEP POURING BUCKETS INTO THIS WASH PLANT, MAKING GOLD, WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS JOB, IT'S A HELL OF A LOT OF FUN. GOLD MINING -- I LOVE ALL THE HIGHS. I MEAN, THERE'S THE LOWS WHEN YOU AIN'T IN THE GOLD. AND, THEN, WHEN YOU'RE IN THE GOLD, IT'S THE HIGHS AND YOU'RE ALL PUMPED UP. WE'RE KICKING ASS. WE'RE IN THE GOLD. WE'RE MAKING MONEY. I'M MAKING DAD PROUD. WHOO-HOO! Narrator: WHILE SHAWN IS MAKING MONEY, SEVEN MILES TO THE EAST... I'M GOING INLAND MINING. THAT'S WHERE MY HEART IS. THAT'S WHAT I LOVE TO DO. Narrator: ...HIS FATHER, STEVE, IS ON THE WAY OUT WITH A PLAN ON JUST HOW TO SPEND IT. YEAH, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT GUILTY ABOUT TAKING SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THE CHRISTINE ROSE MAKES TO GO INLAND MINING. BUT ONCE I GET THAT INLAND MINING OPERATION SET UP, IT'S GONNA SUPPORT THE CHRISTINE ROSE BECAUSE THERE'S THOUSANDS, AND THOUSANDS, AND THOUSANDS OF OUNCES ON THIS GROUND I'M LOOKING AT. GOLD MINING IS JUST A BUSINESS. BUT YOU GET BEYOND THE BUSINESS POINT OF IT, AND, BY GOD, IT IS JUST THE -- IT'S A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE. IT'S A TREASURE HUNT EVERY DAY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IN THAT SLUICE BOX. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GO INLAND MINING. OH, HERE COMES THE OLD MAN. TIME TO WASH THE BOX. HOLY CRAP. THESE ARE BIG SWELLS. TOO MUCH GOLD IN THERE. YOU GOT TO WASH IT. SWELLS ARE BAD. NEED TO BE MAKING GOLD. JUST HAUL ASS. Shawn: I'D LIKE TO HAVE ME AS A PARTNER. YOU DO ALL THE WORK, AND I'LL TAKE ALL THE MONEY. I MEAN, HOW CAN YOU BEAT THAT AS A PARTNER? NOW IS THE BEST TIME TO PICK NUGGETS, LIKE RIGHT HERE. KIND OF A DINK, BUT IT'S A NUGGET. HOW MANY HOURS ARE ON THAT? Shawn: 30. WELL, WE NEED TO KEEP THIS THING ROCKING AND ROLLING IF WE'RE GONNA GET SOME INLAND MINING EQUIPMENT. THEM MOTORS ARE A HUNDRED G's. SO, IT'S, LIKE... ARE YOU IN ON THE INLAND MINING OR OUT? WELL, WHERE ARE WE GOING MINING? OH, I GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT, KID. START SAYING THOUSANDS OF OUNCES, I'LL TELL YOU WHEN TO QUIT. THERE'S SOME GOOD GROUND THERE. WELL, THIS GROUND'S STILL PAYING. DON'T YOU WORRY. THEY'LL PAY FOR THEMSELVES. OH, I AM WORRIED. I'M LOOKING AT A DOZER NOW, TOO, YOU KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED TO HAVING A HUNDRED GRAND SITTING IN THE BANK BEFORE WE START SPENDING? YEAH, WELL, NOW, WE NEED TO GO INLAND MINING. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. Shawn: HE'S 60-SOMETHING YEARS OLD, AND HE WANTS TO START A WHOLE NEW VENTURE. HE'S LOST A LOT OF MONEY MINING INLAND, HOPING TO FIND THAT MOTHER LODE. AND HE HASN'T QUITE -- HE HASN'T FOUND IT YET. YOU GOT THE MOST INTERESTING MINER IN THE WORLD ON IT THERE, KID. BEEN THROUGH ALL THE HARD KNOCK. HE AIN'T GONNA DO THAT AGAIN. IT'S A BIG BUSINESS DECISION. THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT'S A BIG RISK. THERE AIN'T NO GUARANTEE TO ANYTHING. WELL, YEAH, WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE A BIGGER TALK ABOUT IT ONE OF THESE DAYS. SOON. WE GOT TO FOCUS ON GETTING THE GOLD OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE BERING SEA RIGHT NOW. I WAS ON A 10-INCH SUCTION DREDGE, AND I WAS DIVING ON GROUND. AND I COULDN'T GET THE GOLD. I COULD SEE IT, BUT THE SUCTION DREDGE JUST COULDN'T GET IT UP. SO I WAS LAYING IN BED THINKING ONE NIGHT. AND THIS BARGE COME UP FOR SALE, AND I WAS LIKE, "DAD, I GOT THIS IDEA. "IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT I BET YOU WE COULD GET SOME GOLD." HE WAS LIKE, "LET'S GO FOR IT!" AND WE STARTED BUILDING THE CHRISTINE ROSE. YOU KNOW, I ENDED UP BUILDING THE THING. HE DIDN'T. Narrator: ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOME... Zeke: THE GOLD JUST, LIKE, CLIMBS ITS WAY UP THESE SPIRALS AND THEN DUMPS OUT THIS LITTLE HOLE. AND ALL THE LIGHT STUFF THAT'S NOT GOLD SPILLS OUT OF HERE. I'M HOPING THIS IS AT LEAST 6 OUNCES IN GOLD FOR 12 HOURS OF DREDGING. SO THAT WOULD BE A HALF AN OUNCE AN HOUR. THAT'LL LOOK GOOD ON MY GOLD-MINING RéSUMé. IF YOU'RE DOING A QUARTER OUNCE AN HOUR ON A 6-INCH DREDGE, YOU'RE DOING GOOD. IF YOU'RE DOING A HALF OUNCE AN HOUR ON A 6-INCH DREDGE, THAT'S BANGING. OKAY, LET'S DO THIS. 6.4. OVER HALF AN OUNCE AN HOUR -- 0.53 OUNCES AN HOUR. Narrator: 6.4 OUNCES IS WORTH OVER $7,600. YOU KNOW, ONE CLEAN UP, ONE GOOD CLEAN UP OF 6 1/2 OUNCES IS NOT GONNA MAKE MY SEASON. I MEAN, I GOT TO KEEP THAT UP LIKE ANOTHER 20 TIMES. I'M LIKE SO, SO HAPPY. YEAH. WELL, I'M GLAD IT MAKES YOU HAPPY. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. HERE YOU GO. Narrator: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF NOME... AT BELMONT BEACH... Kris: SO, LET HEAR THE PLAN THAT YOU HAD. [BLEEP] IF YOU'RE GONNA BE BITCHING, LET'S GO BACK HOME. KRIS KELLY IS MAKING A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO TALK HIS BROTHER OFF THE LEDGE. YOU REALLY NEED TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT THIS. KRIS, I ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT IT. I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS [BLEEP] KRIS. I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS [BLEEP] FOR TWO YEARS. FOR TWO YEARS? NOT WORKING WITH DAD? YEAH. THEN WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I'M GOING HOME FOR THIS LITTLE BIT OF TIME. I'M GONNA GO [BLEEP] WORK PAINTING FOR A LITTLE BIT. I DON'T NEED DAD. WHAT FOR? TO GIVE HIM 50%? FOR WHAT? TO PRETEND TO BE A [BLEEP] TENDER? NO. BECAUSE HE'S GOT THE CLAIM. WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET DOWN 7 MILES -- EVER. WE ARE GOING TO. I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA FIX UP THE BOAT. I'M GONNA PROBABLY HAVE TO PUT MY OWN MONEY INTO IT. YOU GUYS AREN'T GETTING DOWN 7 MILES. NO. I CAN SEE THAT RIGHT NOW. I MEAN, THE SLIGHTEST LITTLE BIT OF WAVE, AND WE GOT TO COME IN. IT'S ASS-HEAVY. I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S ALL. THAT'S ALL THAT'S HERE AND THERE. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE KIND OF FOOLISH RIGHT NOW BY LEAVING. NO, I'M NOT. JUST THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A COUPLE MORE SECONDS. I ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT IT. OKAY. THEN LET'S GO. I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS [BLEEP] Andy: HE HAS HIGH HOPES FOR MY FATHER. I DON'T. I HOPE HE ENJOYS WORKING WITH MY DAD. Narrator: BACK IN THE CITY OF NOME... Man #1: OOH. Man #2: OH, WOW. Emily: THERE'S A LOT OF GOLD IN THIS CLEANUP. Narrator: AFTER A MISERABLE ICE SEASON AND NEARLY LOSING HER DREDGE TO THE FIRST STORM OF THE SUMMER, EMILY RIEDEL IS IN NEED OF A MORALE BOOST. COULD BE 10,000 BUCKS IN THIS BUCKET. ICE WAS JUST SUCH A HELLACIOUS EXPERIENCE. SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS, IT LEAVES YOU WITH NO CONFIDENCE. AND I WORRY ABOUT THAT WITH MY CREW. I MEAN, SO FAR THEY DEMONSTRATED A GREAT DEAL OF COMMITMENT. THEY STUCK AROUND, BUT, YOU KNOW, THOUGH, TONY, AND DARYL, AND TUNS, THEY COULD ALL WALK AWAY TOMORROW. Narrator: THE BEST WAY TO KEEP HER CREW HAPPY? Emily: WIN OF 2014 FOR SUMMER. Narrator: PUTTING A DENT IN THEIR 400-OUNCE GOAL AND SOME GOLD IN THEIR POCKETS. 4, 5, 5 1/2, 7... HOLD ON. 7 1/2 OUNCES? Daryl V.: MINUS THE FUNNEL. 7.2. Narrator: 7.2 OUNCES IS WORTH LESS THAN $9,000. JUST 393 OUNCES TO GO. 7 1/2 OUNCES? MAN, WE CALLED THAT ONE WRONG. Emily: WE CALLED THAT ONE WAY WRONG. WE DID OUR FIRST CLEANOUT, AND WE EXPECTED A LOT MORE AND DIDN'T GET IT. SO THAT'S KIND OF DISAPPOINTING. BUT THIS IS A JOB WHERE YOU HAVE TO HANDLE THE DISAPPOINTMENTS AND THE FAILURES WITH GRACE SO YOU CAN JUST KEEP ON WORKING. SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE MORE. AND, THEN, SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE LESS. YOU NEVER [BLEEP] KNOW. Narrator: OVER AT THE POMRENKE CLEANUP SHACK... GOLD'S FLOWING LIKE FINE WINE. Narrator: ...WHILE HIS FATHER IS FIXATED ON HEADING INLAND, SHAWN IS PROVING JUST HOW MUCH GOLD IS STILL IN THE BERING SEA. Shawn: IT'S GONNA BE A MONSTER CLEANUP. WHEN WE GET SOME MORE GOOD WEATHER, IT'S GONNA BE THE BEST SUMMER THE CHRISTINE ROSE HAS HAD SINCE WE PUT IT IN THE WATER. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE SCREENING ALL THE MATERIAL. THE NEXT STEP, WE'LL TAKE IT TO THE WHEEL AND CLEAN IT -- REFINE IT EVEN FURTHER. OH, AIN'T THAT PRETTY. KA-CHING! KA-CHING! THAT'S A $4,000 OR $5,000 SPOONLOAD RIGHT THERE. JUST KEEP ADDING AND ADDING. DAD'S DREAM IS TO GO INLAND MINING -- ONE LAST SHOT TO GO SEE IF HE CAN HIT IT BIG. AND, I MEAN, WHEN I COME UP WITH THE IDEA FOR THE CHRISTINE ROSE, HE WAS LIKE, "I'M IN. LET'S DO IT. LET'S BUILD IT." SO I GOT TO HAVE HIS BACK ON IT. THAT'S 10. 50. 60. 70. 80. 90. 92 -- 92 OUNCES. Narrator: 92 OUNCES IS A $110,000 PAYDAY. NICE JOB. THAT'S $30,000 A DAY. Steve: I'M PROUD OF SHAWN. YOU KNOW, HE'S A GREAT FINDER OF GOLD AND A GREAT GOLD-GETTER. AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO SEE. YEAH! GOOD MAN. GOOD JOB. Shawn: JUST $30,000 A DAY. THE CHRISTINE ROSE IS PRETTY MUCH DESTROYING EVERYBODY. WE'RE IN GOOD GOLD HERE. YEAH, BABY! KEEP IT COMING! GOT TO GET THAT, GET THAT GOLD! YOU CAN RUN IT? YOU'RE [BLEEP] DAMN RIGHT I CAN. RUN IT! GET YOUR [BLEEP] DAMN ASS OFF THIS BOAT. CAN'T FEEL MY HANDS. PULL HIM UP! PULL HIM UP! Man: WATCH OUT!
