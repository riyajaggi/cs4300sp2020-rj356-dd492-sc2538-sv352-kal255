 Shawn: BUT IT'S 100 MILES FROM HELP. GETTING IT MEANS SURVIVING OUT HERE. Narrator: IN 1898, THREE LUCKY SWEDES HIT THE JACKPOT IN THE CREEKS OF NORTHWEST ALASKA, AND THE BOOMTOWN OF NOME WAS BORN. IN JUST OVER A CENTURY, MINERS HAVE FOUND OVER 3.5 MILLION OUNCES OF GOLD. HANDFUL OF NUGGETS. AND THERE'S STILL FORTUNES BEING MADE. THIS IS WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT FOR A GOLD MINER. Narrator: THE RUSH CONTINUES IN THE BERING SEA WITH DREDGES LITTERING THE COAST IN SUMMERTIME. BUT COME WINTER, ONLY THE TOUGHEST PUSH ON. GOLD IS IN MY HANDS!

 [BLEEP] YEAH! WHOO! OH, [BLEEP]! DON'T DO THAT! Woman: MOVE! MOVE! MOVE! Brad: PULL HIM IN! RED ALERT! [ SINGING OPERA ] OHH! YOU KICKED ME WHEN I WAS DOWN, AND YOU DID. IT'S A LITTLE STORMY OUT. IT'S A BLIZZARD. Kris: IT'S NOT GOOD. PICKER, PICKER. YEAH! REAL AS GOLD. [ CHEERING ] BOOM! CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: AT THE START OF THE 2015 WINTER MINING SEASON... UNDER THIS SPOT'S MEGA GOLD. THE NOME DREDGING FLEET IS SCRAMBLING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. OKAY, WE'RE MOVING. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. Zeke: THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES PUT A MORATORIUM ON ICE MINING. THE WHOLE PROCESS FOR OFFSHORE MINING HAS BEEN UPENDED. Narrator: A NEW MANDATE HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN -- BE OFF THE ICE BY APRIL 15th OR FACE STEEP FINES. IRONICALLY, ON TAX DAY, WE HAVE TO STOP MAKING MONEY. SHORTEST SEASON EVER. JUST A LITTLE BIT OVER A MONTH TO MAKE SOME MONEY OUT THERE. Narrator: TO MAKE IT PAY, MINERS ACROSS THE FLEET ARE TAKING EXTREME MEASURES. THIS CARGO IS GONNA MAKE ME OR BREAK ME. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA WORK. IF IT DOES, THEN IT WILL BE A TOTAL GAME CHANGER IN NOME, ALASKA. Narrator: 100 FROZEN MILES FROM NOME... Narrator:...CAPTAIN SHAWN POMRENKE, A.K.A. MR. GOLD, IS WORKING ON HIS NEXT NICKNAME -- MR. TRAILBLAZER. Narrator: FOR YEARS... Shawn: FORWARD HO. YEAH! Narrator: ...SHAWN AND HIS OLD MAN, STEVE, HAVE BEEN BUILDING A GOLD MINING EMPIRE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD SEASON THIS YEAR. I HAVE A FEELING. Narrator: LAST SUMMER... THAT IS A -- HOLY... THAT'S HEAVY. Narrator: ...THEY PEAKED WITH A 1,145-OUNCE, $1.4 MILLION TAKE. YEAH! Shawn: BUILDING A LEGACY FOR THE POMRENKES IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. I WANT MY KIDS TO BENEFIT, AND I WANT THEIR KIDS TO BENEFIT FROM ALL THIS. Narrator: NOW HE'S NOT ABOUT TO TAKE HIS FOOT OFF THE GAS. Narrator: LOOKING TO EXPAND THE DYNASTY, SHAWN IS USING THE SHORT SEASON TO FOLLOW A DREAM -- SEARCH FOR GOLD ON A REMOTE CLAIM 100 MILES FROM NOME -- THE BLUFF. IF I DON'T GET OUT THERE AND FIND THAT NEW HOT SPOT, WHO WILL? BACK 100 YEARS AGO, THERE WAS THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOWN THERE WITH PICKS AND SHOVELS MINING THAT BEACH, JUST LIKE NOME. NOME -- WE FOUND THE GOLD IN THE OCEAN. YOU KNOW THERE'S GOT TO BE GOLD OUT THERE IN THE OCEAN, TOO. WE'RE GONNA GO FIND THAT MOTHER LODE. THIS GETS ME REALLY EXCITED. YOU SEE MINING LIKE THIS, AND IT ENDS RIGHT HERE. ENDS RIGHT AT THE OCEAN. YOU LOOK AT ALL THE WORK THEY DID TO GET THIS GOLD OUT OF HERE. WE'RE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF [BLEEP] NOWHERE, AND THEY COME UP HERE AND GOT THIS -- DID ALL THIS WORK. BROUGHT THAT BIG-ASS TIMBER. YOU CAN SEE THE REMNANTS OF THEIR SLUICE BOX COMING DOWN. I GUARANTEE YOU THERE'S A TON OF GOLD RIGHT OUT HERE. NOBODY'S EVER DOVE OUT HERE. THEY'VE MINED UP HERE BECAUSE THERE'S GOLD. NOBODY'S EVER THOUGHT ABOUT MINING OUT THERE. WE'RE GONNA BE THE LEAD DOGS ON THIS TRAIL. Narrator: BEING THE LEAD DOG THIS FAR FROM TOWN IS A RISKY PROPOSITION. BESIDES THE PERIL OF MINING UNDER THIN ICE, SHAWN AND HIS CREW WILL HAVE TO SURVIVE OFF THE GRID IN THE SUBARCTIC WINTER. IT'S A DANGEROUS SPOT, AND IT'S THE MOST DANGEROUS ADVENTURE I'LL EVER GO ON. Narrator: WHILE SHAWN'S ADVENTURE IS ONLY BEGINNING, 100 MILES WEST, IN THE CITY OF NOME... FOR CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL, THE SEASON MAY ALREADY BE OVER. I JUST SPOKE WITH D&R;, AND THEY'RE PERMITTING ME THIS SEASON. THEY CHANGED THEIR WHOLE PERMITTING SETUP, AND BASICALLY, ONLY A COUPLE PEOPLE GOT PERMITS THIS SEASON. I WAS TOO LATE OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M NOT ONE OF THEM. THEY JUST TURNED ME DOWN FOR A PERMIT. [ BLEEP ] Narrator: AS THE ONLY FEMALE DREDGE OWNER IN THE FLEET, NOME HAS ALWAYS BEEN A ROLLER COASTER FOR EMILY. NOT EVEN GOD COULD SINK THIS SHIP! NOT EVEN GOD COULD SINK THIS SHIP! Narrator: SHE CAME TO TOWN TO DREDGE WITH HER CHILDHOOD LOVE, ZEKE TENHOFF. THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME! YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR DEBTS. YOU CAN'T OWN PROPERTY FOR FREE! BUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WENT UP IN FLAMES. YOU'RE WELCOME FOR EVERYTHING! [ ALL CHEERING ] SO, SHE SET OUT ON HER OWN... WHOO! 21, 22... ...PULLING IN NEARLY 300 OUNCES IN TWO SEASONS AS CAPTAIN. HA-HA! YOU DOUBTING [BLEEP] OUT THERE! Narrator: NOW SHE'S OUT OF LUCK AGAIN. I'VE GOT A TEAM OF DIVERS COMING UP HERE. I HAD THIS WHOLE [BLEEP] OPERATION PLANNED OUT, AND I CAN'T RUN NOW. I CAN'T GO OUT AND [BLEEP] MINE NOW. I CAN'T MINE WITHOUT A [BLEEP] PERMIT. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. Narrator: WITH THE CLOCK TICKING, EMILY HAS TO FIND A NEW PLAN. SPEAKING OF NEW PLANS... BEEN UP HERE -- THIS IS COMING UP ON FIVE YEARS. Narrator: ...CAPTAIN VERNON ADKISON HAS ONE OF HIS OWN. I SOLD THE WILD RANGER. I SOLD THE BERING BOOTY. I'VE SOLD A LOT OF MY OTHER EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. I'M THINKING IT'LL BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE FROM MY PRESENT WAY OF DOING BUSINESS. THE HUMAN ELEMENT WILL BE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY. NOT THAT I GOT ANYTHING AGAINST HUMANS. Narrator: FOR VERNON... YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M [BLEEP] DOING?! YOU WANT TO GO, VERN? YEAH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DO! COME ON! COME ON! Narrator: ...THE HUMAN ELEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM. BUT AFTER A MASSIVE 366-OUNCE YEAR WORTH ALMOST HALF A MILLION DOLLARS... Vernon: 2.5 POUNDS OF GOLD. Narrator: ...THE SKIPPER IS DOUBLING DOWN. ONCE I GET IT PAID FOR, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SPLITTING THE GOLD WITH IT. Narrator: PITTING HUMAN STRENGTH AGAINST HUMAN INNOVATION, VERNON HAS SPENT OVER 100 GRAND BRINGING TO TOWN A SUPER DREDGE. Vernon: IT'S A RISK WORTH TAKING. THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF TONS OF GOLD OFFSHORE IN NOME. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'M GONNA LIVE. I MIGHT END UP WITH JUST A HEAD IN A JAR WITH HOSES AND TUBES. I'M STILL GONNA BE OUT THERE GUNNING FOR THAT GOLD. [ HORN HONKS ] Narrator: ALREADY RUNNING A DIVER OPERATION, VERNON IS ABOUT TO TURN IT UPSIDE-DOWN. Vernon: OKAY, GUYS. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU I HAD A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU, RIGHT? Man: OH, DAMN! COME MEET YOUR COMPETITION. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: ENTER THE SUB DREDGE, A 5,000-POUND SUBMERSIBLE WORKHORSE. ITS SEVEN-FOOT ROBOTIC ARM IS EQUIPPED WITH A SELF-SORTING CLASSIFIER BASKET THAT HAS THE POWER TO CHEW THROUGH COBBLE AND DIG DEEP INTO THE PAY DIRT. FOR SUCTION, A FOUR-INCH-HIGH SOLID PUMP DESIGNED TO MOVE SAND AT A RATE OF 120 CUBIC YARDS PER HOUR. IF IT WORKS, IT'LL OUT-DREDGE A HUMAN 15 TIMES OVER. THAT'S A HELL OF A PUMP RIGHT THERE. IT'S LIKE JOHN HENRY vs. THE STEAM MACHINE. I'M ROOTING FOR THE STEAM MACHINE 'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE GOLD IS. I MIGHT HAVE A SADDLE BUILT FOR RIGHT HERE. [ LAUGHS ] THIS IS THE AMERICAN WAY. GET OFF YOUR ASS, GET WET, GET SOME GOLD. Narrator: JUST OUTSIDE NOME... Emily: I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT AFTER WORKING REALLY [BLEEP] HARD TO TRY TO BE INDEPENDENT AND SEPARATE MYSELF FROM THE CRAZY THAT GOES ON UP HERE, I AM DOING THIS. I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M DOING THIS. Narrator: IN ORDER TO SALVAGE A MINING SEASON, EMILY RIEDEL MUST FIND A PARTNER WITH A PERMIT. HERE WE GO. I WISH THIS WAS VODKA. LOOKING AT MY OPTIONS, THEY'RE EXTREMELY LIMITED. ZEKE HAS SOMETHING THAT I NEED, WHICH IS A MINING PERMIT. I'M ALSO TIRED OF HAVING ENEMIES IN NOME. AND ZEKE IS ONE OF MY GREATEST ENEMIES. AND I WOULD LIKE THAT TO CHANGE. HEY, ZEKE. OH. HEY. OH, IT'S EMILY. I... WHAT -- WHAT -- WHAT BRINGS YOU UP HERE? I THOUGHT I WAS SAFE. [ BOTH LAUGH ] Narrator: JUST EAST OF NOME... WITHOUT A MINING PERMIT IN HAND, DESPERATE TIMES EQUAL DESPERATE MEASURES FOR EMILY RIEDEL. HEY, ZEKE. OH. HEY. OH, IT'S EMILY. I... WHAT -- WHAT -- WHAT BRINGS YOU OUT HERE? I THOUGHT I WAS SAFE. [ BOTH LAUGH ] YOU'RE NOT SAFE FROM ME. YOU HAD TO COME A LONG WAY. WHAT'S GOING ON? LIKE, WHAT? I DON'T KNOW, DUDE. IT'S -- IT'S WEIRD. I DROVE OUT HERE, AND I FELT LIKE I WAS JUST KIND OF, LIKE, IN A DAZE. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GONNA ASK EXACTLY. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW... I JUST KEPT, LIKE, MY FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL, AND I'M LIKE, "I AM HEADING NORTH -- NORTHEAST. I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I'M JUST HEADING NORTH." BUT...IT'S SORT OF -- YOU BETTER FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA ASK. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ASK FOR HELP, BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING, BASICALLY. I CAN'T GET A PERMIT THIS YEAR. D&R; JUST KIND OF [BLEEP] A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF PERMITS FOR ICE, AND I WAS ONE OF THEM. OKAY, WELL, THAT CLEARS THINGS UP... I GUESS. WELL, THE PROBLEM IS I HAVE A TEAM OF DIVERS COMING UP, AND I NEED SOMEBODY WITH A PERMIT SO I CAN GET [BLEEP] DONE. OKAY, SO THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THAT YOU GOT HOSED IN THE PERMITTING DEPARTMENT. I HAVE A PERMIT. AND RIGHT NOW, THE MOST CONVENIENT PERSON YOU CAN FIND THAT HAS A PERMIT IS ME. THAT'S THE SIMPLE VERSION. THE OTHER VERSION IS THAT I WANT TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN. IF YOU'RE COMING HERE TO START, LIKE, ESSENTIALLY A MINING BUSINESS-TEAM- PARTNERSHIP THING, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR, LIKE, TOUCHY-FEELY FRIEND STUFF. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. SO, WE'LL WORK ON THE FRIENDSHIP PART, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO BE, LIKE, FROM A MUTUAL PLACE OF RESPECT IF WE'RE GONNA DO BUSINESS TOGETHER. AT THIS POINT, I CAN'T, LIKE, HAND YOU A DONE-AND-READY ICE OPERATION BY ANY MEANS, BUT I CAN HELP. I CAN CONTRIBUTE ANY WAY I CAN. I CAN GIVE YOU A TEAM OF DIVERS, AND I CAN CONTRIBUTE EVERY RESOURCE I HAVE OR EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT I HAVE TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING OUT HERE. LIKE, WAIT. LIKE, WELL, I MEAN, OKAY. I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS KIND OF, LIKE -- I HAVE TO INTERNALIZE IT FOR A SECOND, BUT IT WOULD BE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT GEAR SHIFT FOR ME. SO, PARTNERS? OKAY. SOUNDS LEGIT. OKAY. OKAY. SEE YA. CHEERS. BYE. Zeke: THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS EMILY IS NOT BRINGING TO THE TABLE, BUT EMILY IS SOMEONE WHO HAS SUCCESSFULLY MADE MONEY OFF THE MINING BUSINESS. CAN WE USE EACH OTHER IN A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL FASHION TO WORK TOGETHER? SHE HAS THIS LABOR FORCE OF OTHER PEOPLE. AND, HONESTLY, WHEN IT COMES TO ICE MINING, IT'S A LOT OF LABOR, A LOT OF WORK. THERE'S A GIANT POSSIBILITY THAT I COULD DO A LOT BETTER IF I HAD A BIG CREW OF DUDES. Emily: I HAVE AN OPERATION TO RUN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF [BLEEP] OPTIONS, SO I CHOSE ZEKE. Narrator: WHILE EMILY PATCHES TOGETHER HER SEASON... SIX MILES AWAY, JUST WEST OF THE HARBOR... WE'RE ALMOST IN THE WATER. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS ASSEMBLE... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LOOKING AT YOU. DO THAT ONE DAMN JOB, PLEASE. I AM. OKAY. ALL WE GOT TO DO IS JUST WORK TOGETHER AND GET THIS DONE. Narrator: THE FLEET'S NEWEST CAPTAIN, KRIS KELLY, AND HIS LITTLE BROTHER ANDY, ARE RIGGING UP THEIR FIRST EVER WINTER OPERATION. Kris: WE'RE CALLING OUR LITTLE SETUP THE PADDY WAGON, WHICH I THINK IS A PRETTY COOL NAME. IT'S A SIX-INCH POWERHOUSE. EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE AWESOME. Narrator: THE PADDY WAGON -- AN 8-BY-12-FOOT WINTER DREDGE OF KRIS' OWN MAKING. ANDY AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL A QUICK 90 OUNCES. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NEVER REALLY HAD GREAT SUCCESS AS A FAMILY. IF ANDY GETS FOCUSED WITH ME, WE'RE UNSTOPPABLE. WE GOT HOT WATER. WE GOT FUEL. WE'VE GOT THE AIR. WE'VE GOT THE ENGINE. WELL, LET'S HURRY UP. WE CAN STILL BEAT DAD UNDERNEATH THE WATER IF WE HURRY. ANCHOR AWEIGH. Narrator: FOR MOST OF THEIR ADULT LIFE, KRIS AND ANDY HAVE WORKED FOR THEIR OLD MAN, BRAD. BUT -- BUT -- BUT -- BUT -- BUT -- BUT -- BUT -- BUT -- SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP. BUT AFTER YEARS OF BEING USED... THAT WAS 50%, BUDDY. IT WASN'T THAT GOOD OF A GOLD RUN. [ BLEEP ] ...AND ABUSED.... Brad: WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: ...THE BOYS HIT THEIR LIMIT. Kris: PAYBACK'S A BITCH. Narrator: AFTER ALL THE WORK THEY DID TO BREAK AWAY... RIGHT NOW... I GOT A DIVER GOING DOWN. GOOD FOR YOU. DON'T HATE, APPRECIATE. Narrator: ...THE KELLY BOYS SURE DIDN'T FALL TOO FAR FROM THE TREE. THEY SET UP CAMP RIGHT NEXT TO THEIR DAD'S OPERATION -- THE REAPER. HE'S A LITTLE PISSED OFF THAT WE'RE OVER HERE, BUT THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN REALLY DO. WE OVERHEARD HIM SAYING THAT HE WAS ON A GOOD CLAIM AND HE HAD SOME GOOD GPS SPOTS THAT HAD GOOD GOLD, SO WHY NOT? JUST JUMP RIGHT IN AND DO WHAT HE DOES TO US -- SCREW US OVER. Narrator: WITH LIMITED MINING GROUND UNDER BOTH THEIR FEET, THE FIRST DREDGE IN THE WATER TAKES THE GOLD. Brad: ONE SMALL STEP FOR YOU. ONE BIG STEP FOR THE REAPER. IS HE UNDER THE WATER? YEAH. [BLEEP], MAN. THIS SUCKS. Narrator: FIRST OUT FOR DAD, COMMERCIAL DIVER DAVE NELSON. HEY, BOYS, HE'S ON THE NOZZLE. HE'S WORKING IT. HEY, PLEASE LEAVE ME THE [BLEEP] ALONE. DON'T BE UPSET. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY FOR ME, WANT TO SHARE IN THE JOY. LET'S GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE. KRIS SHOULDN'T HAVE QUIT, NO MATTER WHAT. A LOT OF THINGS PISS HIM OFF. HI, BABE. FIRST OF ALL, I GOT A GIRLFRIEND THAT'S YOUNGER THAN BOTH OF THEM. HI. HI, MINI BUMPKINS. THIS IS THE SMALLEST KELLY. NIA KELLY. LOOK AT HER. I HAD ANOTHER BABY BEFORE EITHER ONE OF THEM DID. THAT PISSES THEM OFF. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T PLAN ON ANY OF THAT. IT'S JUST GOD PUT ME ON THAT PATH. YOU KNOW, IF YOU BELIEVE IN THAT [BLEEP]. HOW'S THE SUCTION? DOES IT FEEL LIKE WE HAVE ENOUGH? Narrator: WITH A HOT-WATER LINE TO PREVENT HYPOTHERMIA AND A POWERFUL SUCTION HOSE, MINING UNDER THE ICE IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT JOB... WHAT DID YOU SAY? YOUR LEFT NUT HURTS? Narrator: ...ESPECIALLY IF YOU WORK FOR BRAD. DIVER OUT OF THE HOLE. THAT'S LIKE TWO MINUTES IN. ARE YOU OUT ALREADY? Andy: OH, HE'S TAKING HIS GLOVES OFF, HE'S DONE. HEY! HOW'S IT GOING? YOUR DIVER'S LOOKING GREAT, MAN. [ LAUGHS ] WHAT WAS THAT? FIVE MINUTES? JUST FIVE. HEY, MAN! GREAT JOB, DUDE! Narrator: AFTER JUST A FEW MINUTES, THE OLD MAN'S FIRST REPLACEMENT FOR HIS SONS IS A WASHOUT. BABY NIA COULD HAVE GONE DOWN AND PROBABLY DOVE A LITTLE MORE. HE HAD SOME EAR PROBLEMS, THIS PROBLEM. NO, I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE. THAT'S CALLED CHICKEN-[BLEEP] PROBLEMS. Narrator: IN NOME, CHICKEN-[BLEEP] PROBLEMS AREN'T EXACTLY NEW PROBLEMS. AND VERNON ADKISON THINKS HE'S FOUND THE SOLUTION. Vernon: ALL RIGHT, DIVER DOWN. OKAY. Narrator: IT'S ALL SYSTEMS GO FOR THE NEW $100,000 SUPER DREDGE. THE MOMENT OF TRUTH RIGHT ABOUT NOW. A LITTLE NERVOUS, BUT THAT'S GOOD. IT'S HEALTHY NERVOUS. Narrator: ON THE CONTROLS, VETERAN MINER AND CREW CHIEF DEREK McCLARTY. EVERYBODY READY? DEREK -- HE'S AN ALL-ROUND HEAVY HITTER. HE'S LIKE A ONE-MAN A-TEAM. WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO, HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT. VERN? ALL RIGHT. HANDS AND FEET INSIDE THE RIDE. GOING DOWN! HEY, BOBBY, DO YOU HAVE IT IN SIGHT? I GOT IT IN SIGHT, VERNON. IT'S MAKING ITS WAY DOWN NICELY. Vernon: ABOUT HOW MANY FEET TO GO? YOU GOT ABOUT 10, 12 FEET. 10 TO 12 FEET TO GO. OKAY. JUST KEEP US POSTED. COPY THAT. JUST RELAY WHAT HE SAYS, OKAY? FOUR FEET. Vernon: FOUR FEET. IT'S ALMOST ON THE BOTTOM. Narrator: USED IN HARBORS IN THE LOWER 48, THE SUB DREDGE HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED IN CONDITIONS AS BRUTAL AS THE 25-DEGREE BERING SEA. Bobby: EASY. ALL RIGHT, TOUCHDOWN ON THE LEFT TRACK. AND TOUCHDOWN ON THE SECOND TRACK. E.J.? I WISH I HAD SOME CHAMPAGNE, NOT TO BREAK. Narrator: SAFELY ON THE BOTTOM, THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS ARRIVED. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA TO START DIGGING. E.J.: SHE'S RAMPING UP. Bobby: OKAY, PUMP'S GOING. SHE'S GOT SUCTION. HOW'S IT LOOKING OUT THERE? OVER. NOZZLE'S DOWN. GOING TO WORK. LOOKS LIKE IT'S, UH... JUST DISREGARDING THE BIGGER MATERIAL AND TAKING EVERYTHING ELSE UNDERNEATH IT. OH, YEAH. NICE. THAT WATER'S DIRTY. THAT'S A GOOD THING. IT'S PUSHING A HECK OF A LOT OF MATERIAL THROUGH THIS BOX -- MORE MATERIALS THAN I'VE SEEN BY FAR. OH, YEAH, THIS IS FANTASTIC. THIS THING'S MY -- THIS THING'S MY NEW BUDDY. Vernon: ALL RIGHT, BOBBY. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. Narrator: WITH THE INITIAL TEST A SUCCESS, NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHETHER THE MACHINE WILL CAPTURE THE GOLD. Vernon: WELL, THE SUB DREDGE IS EXPENSIVE. PROBABLY COST ME ABOUT 20 GRAND JUST TO GET IT UP HERE. FINGERS CROSSED IT'LL WORK. Narrator: IN THE CITY OF NOME... AT THE POMRENKE WORKSHOP... LET'S GET THIS STUFF LOADED UP, MARKED OFF, PACKED UP, AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Narrator: ...MR. GOLD IS PREPPING TO RISK HIS MINING SEASON AND HIS LIFE 100 MILES FROM SAFETY ON THE HUNT FOR THE MOTHER LODE. THE FUTURE IS ALWAYS SCARY AS A GOLD MINER. BUT GOLD MINING IS ALL ABOUT TAKING RISKS. AS THE EXPEDITION LEADER, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T FORGET ANYTHING AND ARE PREPARED FOR ANY SITUATION THAT COMES. JUST IN CASE WE HAVE ANY CLAIM JUMPERS. I'VE GOT MY LITTLE PTARMIGAN KILLER HERE. [BLEEP] ME. [ LAUGHS ] LOADED. WHAT'S GOING ON, GUYS? COME ON, CORA. CODY. WHOO! YEAH, YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE DOGS AT HOME. MAN'S BEST FRIEND. OH, YEAH. OH, ALMOST FORGOT THIS. HUH? CAN'T FORGET THE FLAG. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING OUT AND CHASING THIS DREAM OF GOING TO THE BLUFF. THAT'S A BIG RISK AND SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY DOING IT, BUT HOPEFULLY, IT PAYS OFF BIG. Narrator: EQUIPPED WITH A SMALL, SIX-INCH SUCTION DREDGE, TWO DIESEL TANKS, AND ENOUGH FOOD AND SUPPLIES TO HOPEFULLY LAST THE THREE-MAN CREW... WE GOT A REAL HEAVY LOAD WITH ALL THIS FUEL AND ALL THE MINING GEAR. Narrator: ...THE JOURNEY INTO THE WILD BEGINS. Shawn: I'M GONNA LEAVE ALL THE SCRAPS FOR THE BOYS HERE WHILE I GO DOWN TO THE BLUFF AND GET RICH. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Narrator: ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN... HELLO. HEY. HELLO, EVERYBODY. [ CHUCKLES ] WOW, THIS IS NICE. THIS IS COOL. OH, THANK YOU. Narrator: ...AFTER STRIKING A DEAL WITH EMILY... THIS IS MY TEAM OF BEAUTIFUL FEMALE DIVERS. ...ZEKE GETS HIS FIRST LOOK AT HIS PROMISED LABOR FORCE. THEY'RE ALL FEMALE. I DON'T KNOW IF I NEEDED TO SAY THAT. HI. I WAS JUST LIKE, YES, THEY ARE CHICKS. I DECIDED TO BRING THREE FEMALE DIVERS UP THIS SEASON BECAUSE WOMEN ARE EQUALLY TENACIOUS. SOCIETY HAS TO GROW OUT OF THIS NOTION THAT NOME BELONGS TO MEN. AND THIS IS SHELBY. SHELBY. NICE TO MEET YOU. SHELBY HAS PROBABLY MORE EXPERIENCE COLLECTIVELY THAN ALMOST THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF GOLD-DIVING MINERS UP HERE. SHE'S ACTUALLY, LIKE, A CERTIFIED RESCUE DIVER. I DON'T THINK THAT ZEKE IS EVEN DIVE CERTIFIED AT THIS POINT. THIS IS KENDALL. HEY. KENDALL, I REMEMBER YOU FROM 8th GRADE. I REMEMBER YOU. KENDALL AND I GREW UP IN HOMER TOGETHER. SHE WAS A FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER AND A FISHERMAN HERSELF, SO I KIND OF FIGURED IT WOULD WORK OUT. YOU KNOW, TRANSLATE EASILY FROM FISHERWOMAN TO GOLD MINER. THIS IS JEN. ALL RIGHT. HEY, JEN. NICE TO MEET YOU. Emily: JEN HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE, BUT I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE CHARACTER THAT MAKES THE DIVER. AND I THINK THAT JEN HAS THAT CHARACTER. WELL, I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW DOWN TO BUSINESS TO GET. I DON'T WANT TO, LIKE, TRY TO DISCOUNT ANYONE'S EXPERIENCE, BUT, LIKE, THE DREDGING DEPARTMENT OF DIVING IS JUST KIND OF LIKE IT'S OWN ANIMAL. I HAD A GUY, LIKE, ALMOST DIE. HE WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO WHERE HIS TETHER WAS. YOU KNOW, COULDN'T BREATHE. TRIED TO GET TO THE SURFACE. COULDN'T GET TO THE SURFACE, AND, LIKE, IT GOT UGLY. IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MAKE US FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE? I DON'T KNOW WANT TO SCARE ANY OF YOU GUYS. IF YOU GO UNDERWATER, YOU'RE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN LIFE. MM-HMM. THAT'S HOW I SEE IT. LIKE, IF YOU GUYS ARE UP FOR RISKING YOUR LIVES TO GET SOME GOLD, THEN THAT'S AWESOME. Zeke: THEY LOOK ALL RIGHT TO ME. THEY'RE PRETTY LADIES. I'M DOWN FOR THAT. I LIKE LADIES. WHAT CAN I SAY? WHETHER OR NOT THESE LADIES ARE GONNA PROVE THEMSELVES TO BE HARD WORKERS AND GOOD DREDGERS IS YET TO BE SEEN. MAYBE THEY'LL MAKE ME SOME MONEY, MAYBE THEY WON'T. BUT IF THEY DON'T MAKE ME SOME MONEY, THEN I CAN JUST FIRE THEM, AND I CAN JUST GO MINING BY MYSELF AGAIN ANYWAY. IF WE GET MY SHACK OUT ON THE ICE, WE COULD BE UNDERWATER, AND WE COULD BE PUMPING GOLD THROUGH THIS SLUICE BOX AND MAKING MONEY. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND START TOWING [BLEEP] DOWN TO THE RIVER, THEN. Narrator: WHILE TEAM CLARK PREPS TO HEAD OUT TO THE ICE... EIGHT MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE STILL-UNFINISHED PADDY WAGON... OKAY, LET ME THINK OF HOW I'M GONNA DO THIS. FOR HOURS, THE KELLY BOYS HAVE BEEN RACING TO GET THEIR RIG UP AND RUNNING... DON'T GET ANGRY, KRIS. DON'T GET ANGRY. ...AND BEAT THE OLD MAN TO THE GOLD. THERE IT IS. DAD'S GETTING ANOTHER DIVER DOWN. AS FOR BRAD, AFTER A WHOPPING FIVE-MINUTE FIRST DIVE, HIS CRACK TEAM IS READY FOR ANOTHER GO. THIS TIME, A SECOND ROOKIE DIVER -- BYRON COE. THAT LOOKED LIKE A PROFESSIONAL ENTRY TO ME. I'M ON THE BOTTOM. HOW'S IT GOING, BYRON? IT'S GOING. I'M DOWN TO THE HARD PANS. I FOUND THIS GUY AT THE BAR, DUDE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS SKILL LEVEL IS, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S SUCKING A LOT OF O2 DOWN THERE. SCARED. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] YOU CAN HEAR IT IN HIS BREATH. LISTEN TO HIM. SOUNDS LIKE HE'S SLEEPING AT THE BOTTOM. YOU OKAY DOWN THERE? OHH, GOD, MY HEAD HURTS! Brad: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR HEAD? YOU GETTING A SINUS SQUEEZE OR SOMETHING? I FEEL LIKE MY RIGHT EYE IS GONNA BLOW OUT OF MY HEAD. OH, IT HURTS LIKE A BITCH. I GOT MY SECOND DIVER DOWN. THE FIRST DIVER DIDN'T PAN OUT. THE SECOND DIVER, I DON'T THINK IT'S WORKING OUT, EITHER. OHH! OHH, MY HEAD'S GONNA EXPLODE, IT FEELS LIKE. THIS IS DRIVING ME NUTS. FINALLY, I GOT AN OPERATION GOING, AND I GOT BOZO THE CLOWN DOWN DIVING THE FIRST TIME. YOU KNOW, I -- CAPTAIN, THAT'S ALL I GOT. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] IT'S HARD TO LISTEN TO THIS [BLEEP]. IT'S WORSE THAN LISTENING TO MY KIDS. [ BLEEP ] [ BREATHING RAPIDLY ] AAH! AAH! Brad: PULL HIM IN! RED ALERT! HURRY! PULL HIM IN! Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, AT THE REAPER... [ BYRON BREATHING RAPIDLY ] AAH! AAH! Brad: PULL HIM IN! RED ALERT! HURRY! PULL HIM IN! Narrator: IN 25-DEGREE WATER, CONDENSATION FROM BYRON'S HEAVY BREATHING HAS FROZEN SHUT HIS REGULATOR, CUTTING OFF ALL OXYGEN. Brad: PULL HIM IN QUICK! THESE DIVERS -- THEY DON'T MEASURE UP. THEY SUCK. I NEED MY BOYS BACK. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. Narrator: WITH BOTH DAD'S DIVERS FAILING TO EVEN STAY ON THE BOTTOM... THE FIGHTIN' KELLY BROTHERS STILL HAVE A FIGHTIN' CHANCE. WE'RE [BLEEP] HERE, FIRST DIVE, FIRST HOLE, 10 OUNCES [BLEEP]! THERE GOES BRAD AND THE MARIACHI BAND. AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE A LITTLE BIT OUTNUMBERED. GET DOWN THERE, MOP UP IN FRONT OF DAD'S SHACK AS MUCH AS WE CAN. WELL, START PUNCHING A HOLE, AND LET ME KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. [ LAUGHS ] SOUNDS GOOD. RIP IT APART AND SEE WHAT'S THERE. MY DAD'S ALREADY GONE HOME, SO HE MIGHT HAVE BEAT US UNDER THE WATER FIRST, BUT WE'RE GONNA GET THE MOST HOURS FOR TODAY AND THE MOST GOLD, SO I'M NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT. OH, GREAT. Narrator: A VETERAN DIVER, KRIS' TACTIC TO AVOID FREEZE-UPS -- USE THE HOT-WATER LINE IN HIS SUIT TO THAW THE REGULATOR. YEAH, I'M OKAY. HOLY [BLEEP] THOUGH. HOLY [BLEEP]. WE'RE GOOD. FREEZE YOUR ASS OFF AND KEEP SUCKING IT UP. Narrator: WHILE THE KELLY BOYS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS, 500 YARDS AWAY, AT THE WILD RANGER... Vernon: THE GOLDEN SEA HORSE. WE GOT TO GIVE IT A PAINT JOB. IT NEEDS TO BE GOLDEN. Narrator: ...VERNON'S GOLDEN SEA HORSE IS WRAPPING ITS FIRST DAY UNDER THE ICE. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES IN THIS SORT OF THING. IT'S NEVER BEEN USED UP HERE, AND IT'S NEVER BEEN USED FOR MINING GOLD. IT COULD BE THE BEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED UP HERE. Narrator: AFTER HOURS OF MOVING DIRT, THE BIG QUESTION... WE'RE CLEANING OUT THE TEST MAT RIGHT NOW. WAS IT PAY DIRT? THERE'S GOLD IN THE BOX. GOOD TEST MAT. THAT'S THE BEST THING I'VE SEEN SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE ICE. WE'RE STARTING TO GET SOME GOLD, THAT'S FOR SURE. THIS IS PRETTY EXCITING BUSINESS FOR ME. THIS MACHINE HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR MAKING ME A VERY WEALTHY MAN. WE'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOX. Narrator: OUTSIDE NOME'S CITY LIMITS... [ SINGING OPERA ] Narrator: ...FRIENDS-TURNED RIVALS-TURNED-PARTNERS EMILY RIEDEL AND ZEKE TENHOFF HAVE FORMED AN UNEASY ALLIANCE. BUT WHETHER THEIR CO-CAPTAINCY WILL SUCCEED OR CRASH AND BURN IS ANYBODY'S GUESS. Zeke: EMILY OPERATES PURELY OUT OF SELF-INTEREST, AND THAT'S FINE. IF I LOOK AT EMILY FROM A POSITION OF, LIKE, "EMILY, YOU ARE A BUSINESSWOMAN. YOU WILL ALWAYS MAKE THE BEST DECISION FOR EMILY, AND THAT'S FINE," THEN I CAN WORK WITH THAT. BUT I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND THAT EMILY'S GONNA BE MY FRIEND 'CAUSE SHE NEVER WILL BE. Emily: THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT CAN REALLY STOP ME. YOU CAN ROLL WHATEVER PUNCHES YOU CAN AT ME, BUT I'M JUST GONNA KEEP GOING 'CAUSE I'VE SEEN THEM ALL BEFORE. [ SINGING OPERA ] OHH! Narrator: 40 MILES OUTSIDE NOME. YEAH. I DIDN'T WANT TO GET THIS THING STUCK. Narrator: AFTER SIX HOURS OF TRAVELING THROUGH THE BUSH, SHAWN IS MET WITH THE EXPEDITION'S FIRST BIG HURDLE. Shawn: BUT ONCE I GET IT GOING, I AIN'T GONNA STOP UNTIL I GET UP ON TOP. READY! GOOD! WHOO-HOO! GOT IT! NICE JOB, GUYS! WOLF TRACKS RIGHT HERE BIGGER THAN MY FIST, MAN. THOSE WOLVES ARE HUNGRY RIGHT NOW THIS TIME OF YEAR. WELL, LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE BEFORE IT COMES BACK. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: JUST EAST OF NOME. [ SINGING OPERA ] OHH! Narrator: THE WINTER MINING SEASON IS IN FULL SWING... Narrator: ...WHILE ZEKE AND EMILY HAVE HIT A RELATIVELY MINOR SNAG. Zeke: WELL, EMILY BROKE THROUGH THE ICE HERE, AND WE'RE STUCK. I HOPE WE DIDN'T BREAK A SKI. Narrator: LENDING HIS TALENTS TO THE TOWING EFFORT -- EMILY'S DAD, STEVE. WHAT'S WORSE THAN ONE RIEDEL IN A WORK SITUATION IS TWO RIEDELS. THAT'S JUST THE WORST. UH, YEAH. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO HOOK UP FROM THE BACKSIDE AND YANK HER BACK OUT OF THE RIVER ON THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. DOES ANYONE REMEMBER HOW TO TIE A BOWLINE? 'CAUSE I'VE FORGOTTEN. IF I'M GONNA BE WORKING WITH EMILY, I HAVE TO TAKE A VERY FIRM LEADERSHIP STANCE AND MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE A GOOD PLAN. A GOOD, SOLID YANK FROM THE SKANDIC COULD PROBABLY PULL US BACK OUT OF THIS. Emily: WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF LOGISTICS IN ICE MINING. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA NEED EVERY ABLE-BODIED WOMAN... OR DIVER, RATHER -- I'M SO SORRY. HOW SEXIST OF ME -- TO PUSH THIS THING OUT. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE READY. YAY! WHOO! THAT WAS AWESOME. WE MOVED IT. IT'S A BLOOMIN' MIRACLE! WHOO! WHOO-HOO! WOMEN! WHOO! Narrator: WITH TEAM CLARK BACK ON TRACK... SIX MILES WEST... AT THE PADDY WAGON... HOW MUCH YOU SEEING? Kris: DAD HOOKED US UP WITH A HOT SPOT. HE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THE GOLD HIMSELF, BUT HE NEVER HAS BEEN ABLE TO ANYWAYS. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW, DUDE. COME UP. I'LL MEET YOU AT THE HOLE. COMING. COMING UP. FIRST GOLD. HE'S SEEING FLAKES, SO EVERYTHING'S GOING GOOD. Narrator: THOUGH THEY LOST THE RACE TO GET UNDER THE ICE, KRIS AND ANDY ARE LOOKING TO BE THE FIRST KELLYS TO GET PAID. Kris: THAT'S A BIG FLAKE. WE'RE FIRST ON THE GOLD! Narrator: IN THE KELLY FAMILY GOLD MATCH, ROUND ONE GOES TO JUNIOR. PADDY WAGON FIRST ON GOLD THIS SEASON. EVERYBODY ELSE CAN [BLEEP] OFF! 100 MILES EAST OF NOME... COME ON, COME ON. Narrator: ...AFTER TRAVELING THROUGH THE NIGHT, FOR SHAWN AND THE BOYS... AND THERE IT IS. THERE'S THE BLUFFS. Narrator: ...THE END IS FINALLY IN SIGHT. Shawn: BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. YEAH! WHOO! I WANT TO GET WET. I WANT TO FILL OUR POCKETS UP, HAVE A COUPLE POCKETS FULL OF GOLD WHEN WE GET BACK. NUGGETS, MAN. SOME NUGGETS. WE AIN'T GONNA GET NO DAMN GOLD SITTING ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN HERE. WE BETTER GET OUR ASSES DOWN THERE. YOU READY? YEAH! DOWNHILL FROM HERE. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO VENTURE OUT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER, GET AWAY FROM EVERYBODY. YEAH, IT'S A HELL OF A LOT HARDER, BUT THAT'S WHY I'M A GOLD MINER, FOR THE ADVENTURE OF IT. I PLANNED ON IT BEING A LONG TRIP OUT HERE. YOU WANT IT TO JUST GO SMOOTH WITH NO PROBLEMS, BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE PROBLEMS. YOU GET STUCK. THERE'S A COUPLE HOURS. LOOKING FOR A BIG SLAB OF GOLD. I AIN'T JUST OUT FOLLOWING THE CROWD. I'LL LET THEM TRY TO FOLLOW ME. AND THEY WANT TO TRY TO FOLLOW ME OUT, COME ON. I'LL PICK YOU UP ON MY WAY BACK TO TOWN. Narrator: WITH THE SEASON JUST UNDERWAY, THE WILD RANGER AND PADDY WAGON ARE FIRST TO BANK GOLD. Man: HE'S COMING IN TO LAND. WHO THE HELL'S THAT? YEAH! I CAN'T WAIT TO GET UNDERWATER. YEAH! Woman: STOP! STOP! [ LAUGHS EVILLY ] WHOO-HOO! JUST [BLEEP] LEAVE, PLEASE. WHATEVER, DUDE. Kris: GOLD IS DOWN HERE. GOLD! [ LAUGHS ]
