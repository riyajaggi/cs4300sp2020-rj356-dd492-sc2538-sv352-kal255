 [people chattering indistinctly] [chattering stops] Eat something. Hey. Could you get some sleep? Are you okay? May I speak with Rosa? How are you doing, Rosa? Have a seat. Do you want something to eat? Some coffee? Do you want to talk about it? Say what happened according to you? What do you mean, what I think happened? It's important for me to know how you've experienced it.

 We're trying to control the situation. We're here to help each other. We still don't have an idea. Hester took medication which... can be harmful when taken wrong. A psychosis, an accident. Again? Are you worried about your career? - [clattering] - My career? Everything you say will stay here. Fleur. Fleur. What are you doing? I have a class. What did you say happened? What happened? She's dead. You were there, weren't you? Jesus... Fleur. You were there as well. You saw how she... I don't know what I saw, Rosa. No. No... [whimpering] Fleur. Don't look. Don't look. Get her out of here. Fleur, don't look. No... No, no. [sobbing] I want you all out of here! Everybody out, now. No... Come. [Fleur] No. This can't be a coincidence. Poor Fleur. We should have stopped her, but I didn't see it coming. I think that... [Puk] Why would he do something like this? I've never noticed anything about him. Did you? Sorry? [stammers] I'd like to lie down a bit. [Puk] Okay. Would you like me to stay? [Rosa] No, I'd like to be alone. I'm here for you if you need me. Thank you. [line ringing] [answering machine beeps] [Rosa] Hey, Dad, it's me. You must not answer. I know that you're angry. But call me back, please. [line beeping] [Rosa] Hey, Dad, it's me again. Call me back, please. - Rosa! - Hey, man. [Martin] You're home. Yes. Don't you want some? I've already eaten. Are you ill? No. You look ill. I'm just a bit nauseated. It'll pass. How is she doing? Do you really want to know? I want to see her. That's not going to happen. Because? Your mother is finally stable. She needs calmness. You can't just come here whenever you please. You can't tell me if I can see her or not. As long as your new friends are more important than your home... you won't see your mother. [breathing shakily] [retches] [alert chiming] [alert chiming] [rattling] [chains rattling] [doorbell ringing] Hey. Hey. Was it suicide? [Carmen] You saw it yourself. He hung himself. And you suddenly disappeared. We were worried. [Rosa] I'm sorry. I needed... I needed some time after... After the accident? [Rosa] Yes, that. You look like your mother. Would you like to see her? I can come with you. Why? I want to get to know you better. [doctor] Ma'am... She's more coherent and calm since yesterday afternoon. If the situation remains stable, we will adjust her medication. If she seems a bit indifferent, it could be a side effect... of the medication she gets. It's nothing personal. [door beeps] Hey. Just five minutes, no more. Then they'll have to go. Go ahead. [door beeps] Hey, Mom. Mom? Little angel. Sweetie, everything will be okay. [voice breaking] I don't know. Of course. Daddy is here every day. They take good care of me. That's great. Are you doing okay? Yes. I dream about you. All the time. [Rosa] Really? What do you dream about? [Joyce] What do I dream? Hi. Hello. [Rosa] This is a friend of mine. Carmen. Carmen. Zwanenburg. Zwanenburg? Do you know that name? What are you doing here? [Rosa] Mom? What's wrong? Get out. You have to go. You have to go. - What? - Maurits is behind this. What are you doing? Tell us a bit more about Maurits, Joyce. [Joyce] Maurits. Maurits. How does my mother know your father? They had big plans together. [Joyce] No. [Rosa] Mom? Mom! [Joyce] No, no. - I won't say it. - [Rosa] Mom. Mom. What have they done to you? Don't go back. They hold something captive there. - Mom...? - Underneath Ares. It drives you crazy. It takes everything from you. [alarm wailing] - It takes everything. It eats you alive. - Stop. Stop. What? Beal. No. No, let me go. Rosa! Let me go! Leave me alone! No! No! Rosa! [man] Calm down. [Joyce] No! No! No... Shh. [Rosa] Why did you do that? What was that? I had to know for sure. What? They were engaged, Rosa. She was a member of Ares. My father ordered me to recruit you. At first, I didn't know why. They were engaged. For how long have you known? What's beneath Ares? Why does she say there's something trapped under Ares? Rosa... Tell me. - Tell me! - I don't know. Okay? You were right. I don't know anything. They don't tell me anything. Nothing but a load of crap. Regulations. [both breathing heavily] Beal isn't real, Rosa. A fairy tale. Right? Jacob. Drive.
