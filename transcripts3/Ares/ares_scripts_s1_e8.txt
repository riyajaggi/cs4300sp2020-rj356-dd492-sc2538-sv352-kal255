 Did you know that Jacob committed all those murders? And did you know he'd been in the catacomb? Yes. Did he tell you what he has seen there? No. I'll make sure it gets locked up again. That's safer for everybody. This was her room as well. Your mother was a phenomenal woman in her heyday. You were engaged. Yes. That's correct. That's when you destroyed her. No.

 She should have never left. Stand up. You look so much like her. The same spirit, the same eyes. I have my father's eyes. Your father? Nobody understood why she chose him. When he took her away from Ares, he made her little. By not taking her ambitions seriously. Just like he doesn't take your ambitions seriously. He doesn't believe in you, Rosa. He's not there for you. Never has been. You make one independent choice... you chose yourself, your development... and where is he? Our society requires a certain amount of sacrifice. The ability to make sacrifices... is what differentiates leaders and followers. And to lead this society, it demands everything. I see something in you, Rosa. I felt it the moment you arrived here. I didn't dare to commit to it, but... Rosa, if this evening... you're prepared to make the right choices... you'll become our new president. And we should be grateful for it. You've got it, Rosa. You've got what it takes to become a new kind of leader. A new kind of leader... in these interesting times. Why don't you just tell her what you're planning to do with her? - What she has to do for it? - Carmen, I'm talking with Rosa. What is trapped under Ares? - Carmen... - I'm asking you a question. What do you keep underneath this building? Carmen, that information can only be shared with former presidents. And the current leader. Come here. Take everything downstairs. Are you coming, Rosa? You don't know what he's asking from you. Please, don't do it. Rosa... Jacob wanted me to tell you something. I had to tell you that he trusts you. To do the right thing. Carmen, let her go. Come, Rosa. Let's go. Come. Dear members, before we start this evening, I want to thank our juniors for the beautiful decoration. Thank you. Ares is just for alumni on this special evening. Thank you. We have to go? That's not according to protocol. You want to argue with Zwanenburg? The table arrangement is... Keep walking. Keep walking outside. Go on, keep walking. Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen. Members of Ares, welcome. I'd like to ask the circle to stand up. Honorable members... for some time now I'm responsible... for the progression within Ares. Responsible for purity... integrity and the consistency of it. Okay, turn around and I'll cut you free. No. But Beal is restless. As you know, Ares is out of balance... for years now. And not even the innocent youth manages... to restore the balance. Why not? You'll be... This is not a test. This is real. You'll follow me straight outside. No questions asked. No, I don't want to. It's time for a change. It's time for a radical change. Jacob... they will make her president. And I know what she has to do for that. Ladies and gentlemen... let me introduce you to the next candidate. Rosa Steenwijk! Rosa... Rosa! Don't do it. Rosa. Make your choice, Rosa. Hey. Hey. I've told you a student association is not for you. They'll make me president. Yes. I can tell. I don't feel like myself anymore. Rosa, look at me. You are Rosa Steenwijk, aren't you? Yes. Then do what they ask of you. Finish it, become a leader. Then you can set Beal free. No. Yes. - Yes. - No. Yes. You've never given up in your life. Roos... at first I was alone... and then you came, out of the blue. That wasn't a coincidence. I thought I was the one who had to finish it, but I'm a part of the problem. Me, my family... I don't understand what you mean. You have to free Beal. That's why we met. That's why you started caring about me, and I about you. Do you understand? Do it, Rosa. Do it. Do what they ask of you. Free... Well done, Rosa. Whatever you're feeling now, it'll all be over soon. We all had to do this. Come. Stand up. Madam President. I understand that some of you will have doubts. A female president with a different background. But we have to adapt to our times. This is what has to be done to calm Beal. Honorable Ares members, the future. Just a little while, Rosa, and you can go. To Ares! To Ares! I want to see it. I want to see Beal. She's the president. Carmen... Where is Beal? Beal... is a story we tell the rest of our members. Something to fear. I am Beal. You are Beal. We are Beal. Isn't it beautiful? Older than Amsterdam. Nobody knows how old, exactly... but we're the first to use its full potential. There is no monster. Girl... no. This is everything we expel, the things we don't talk about. The cover-up. We use this to make the decisions others aren't capable of. So, we can be the leaders this country needs. The maintaining of prosperity requires leadership. And leadership requires sacrifices. For 500 years. The Golden Age, our current prosperity... everything that makes this little country great. Fear has no control over me. And the darkness won't see me. The darkness inside of me... is what makes me restless. The darkness inside of me is what I offer you. It is what makes me restless. The darkness inside of me is what I'll give to you. No! 00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,200 - We have to get out of here. - Let's go. Maurits. Maurits!
