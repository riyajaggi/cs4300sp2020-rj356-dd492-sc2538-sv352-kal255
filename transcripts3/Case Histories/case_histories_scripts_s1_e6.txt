 'I love you, Jackson.' Goodbye, Jackson. Bye. 'Jackson?' Ah, you. Ah, me. Got my message, then? Unfortunately. I've got better things to do with my time than come down here and sort you out. Any charges? No, despite the fact that you resisted arrest and assaulted a police officer. Thank you. Aye, well, don't thank me. Thank your lost wee girl. She said they threw the first punch. Reggie. It's all right, it's me.

 Come on, we've got to go. Where's that rental car? Back where it belongs. Lend us ã10. I'll drop you at the hospital. Ah, it's Jackson Brodie, it's not a psychopathic maniac at all. I'm not putting you in my scrapbook. I can smell chips. Can we have some chips? I've not had breakfast. You're not eating in my car. I've not had breakfast, either. I'm starving. Chips for breakfast, then! You look even worse than you did in hospital. How do you know, you didn't see me in hospital? You spoke to me. Don't you remember? It was in my pocket, after the crash. What happened to your stuff? Gone.

 Wallet, phone, everything. So Andrew Jones could be using your identity? Will you check something for me? What? What little Joanna Mason's called nowadays? She's called Joanna Hunter. I knew it. That's Reggie's boss. She's gone missing. The same week Andrew Jones gets out of prison. OK, right, we'll check that out. He must've been on that train, saw me lying there, reckoned I was a goner. Wanted to play dead himself, swapped wallets with you. What's Andrew Jones doing on a train to Edinburgh? Who is Andrew Jones? There is something about Dr Hunter you don't know. CHILDREN LAUGH What shall we do on your birthday, then, wee man? Your first birthday, it's special. Make a face. I think we should put that one there. Come on, then, girls. Time and tide wait for no one. Let's go. Let's go, I said! Now! Found one! Come on! CHILD SCREAMS Run! Run! 'She was the only survivor. 'I found her eight hours later. She was still hiding in the dunes. 'Her face was everywhere, all over the papers.' Dr Hunter? Back then, she was Joanna Mason. Little Joanna Mason. I remember watching it on TV when I was small. My mum cried. She got a new identity and Jones got 30 years. We need to get you to hospital, Jackson. I'm fine. You need to call MAPPA. Joanna Hunter had their number. And then call Stenbridge Prison. I know, these things had crossed my mind. You all right? He's taken her, hasn't he? There's no reason to think that. She probably find out he got out, had a shock, decided to lay low for a few days. Told her husband not to tell anyone. Or she didn't tell him anything. Either way, the police will track her down now. You said you would. What about Reggie? I'll take her home. Go on. Ah. How are you doing? I wasn't expecting to see you again, not alive at least. A patient walks out on me, stays walked out, usually. Open wide. Why am I different? Your colleague. Deborah? Deborah? Who's Deborah? Any nausea? Dizziness? No, I'm fine. We need to check your haemoglobin levels. Let's take some blood, see how anaemic you are. I've got quite an urgent job on. Yes, staying alive. I'll sort a bed out. Yep, absolutely. I'll be sure to give him the message. Thank you. Happy Christmas to you, too. "WALKING IN A WINTER WONDERLAND" PLAYS ON STEREO What the bloody hell's all this? You know, I just did some... What? Oh, come on! The place reeks of clinical depression the other eleven and half months of the year. And speaking of clinical depression... Mr Moore. Mr Brodie. I don't work for clients who lie to me. Ah, yeah... Look, I'm sorry about that. But you found her? Haven't you? You found her? We're done. You know where the door is. I'm going crazy. I'm... Yeah, I found her. She wants a break from you. I can't say I blame her. I'm sure she'll be back for Christmas. Where did she go? I'm not going to tell you. Did she get to you? Did you sleep with her? Think about what you're saying. Did you? Did you screw her?! That's enough! Now go home and calm down. PHONE RINGS Yes? 'How's the hospital?' Eh... Yeah, lovely. I spoke to Stenbridge Prison. Jones only had two visitors in the last 18 months. 'A Catholic priest who came every week and Joanna Hunter.' You're kidding! How many times? Just the once, about a month before he was released. We spoke to Neil Hunter. Apparently, she told him she just needed to get away for a few days. She's just laying low, Jackson. She's fine. Yeah. I remember it, don't you? I was only small, but I wasn't allowed to play out until... Do you remember it? This makes sense of a lot of stuff. I had no idea. That brave wee girl. No idea I actually married her. So you don't know where she is? She's allowed to lay low, isn't she? Well, she's not gone to visit her aunt, has she? What? Well, you told your nanny she's gone to visit an aunt, but she hasn't. Why would you tell her that? Reggie told the police? Well, she was worried. Well? Jo had to get away, didn't she? I covered for her. I'm confused. You were covering for her before you knew you had a reason? I was just embarrassed, as far as Reggie was concerned. Me and Jo had a row, you know? I guess she must've provoked it, so I wouldn't wonder why she went. And Reggie's so attached to Jo, anyway. She looks at me like I'm shite. Mr Hunter, do you, or do you not, know where your wife is? No. She's not committed any crime, has she? She just didn't want to be around when Andrew Jones came out. Are you not concerned? Aye! But she's her own woman, you know? And she's tough. Jo can take care of herself. Happy birthday, darling. That's it. Gabriel will never be a baby again. Reggie, do you think that you can make people do things that they don't want to do? Yeah, of course you can. If somebody asked you to harm yourself, would you do it? Are you still here? No. Would you mind if I stashed my presents in here? Fine. Jackson, what are you going to do on the 25th? Whisky, probably. Nice! Have you at least thought about what to get Marlee? Not yet, no. Well, the bank called earlier and your new credit cards are ready to pick up, so there's no excuse. Jackson? Jackson? See you tomorrow. What should we do on your birthday, then, wee man? ECHOING: Run, Joanna! Run! ECHOING: Run, Joanna! PHONE RINGS Leave it! No, it might be Archie. Oh. Wait. Is it Archie? This had better be bloody good, Jackson. So, clearly a little bit of difficulty adjusting to his new-found freedom. We'll find out where he got the gun. Suicide, you reckon? 30 years of loneliness, guilt. I told you he converted to Catholicism. He goes back to the scene of the crime and blows his brains out. And Joanna Hunter went to see him a month ago. Aye, that's right. And then what? That was his last visit. 'But if somebody asked you' to harm yourself, would you? Where is she now? She manufactured an argument with her husband. She's just gone away for a couple of days. She's hiding, like she did all those years ago, Jackson. And do you know what? I don't really blame her. Maybe. You look very, uh... dressed. Did I interrupt something? You always interrupt something, Jackson. 'Are you sure it was' your husband, Mrs Moore? Yeah. Did he threaten you? Well, I had my headphones in and then I just came straight in here. But he banged on that door for a while and was swearing and stuff, so I thought I should call you. OK. Look, I'm sorry, Michelle, but there's no actual crime. I know it's worrying for you... No, it is worrying. The guy got a private detective after me. It's not Jackson Brodie? Yeah. Right... I'll give you my number. If he shows up again, just call me, OK? Whenever. There you go. Thanks. No problem. Right, Neil Hunter. He owns or part-owns three amusement arcades, two health clubs, a fleet of private hire vehicles and pays the lease for a couple of "beauticians". Criminal record? Nope. Couple of parking fines. One of his places burnt down a few years ago, but it wasn't suspicious. Just an electrical fault. Right. And Mr Moore phoned again - three times. What's he want? Well, first, he said that he'd found his wife, without your help. Then he said he wanted to talk, man to man, and would you go for a drink with him. Then he started crying. Billy's not here. I haven't seen him for ages. We're dealing with him. We're looking for a guy - Reggie. Never heard of him, swear to God. What flat is this? Four. Number four, aye. Billy stashed some stuff of ours here. Reggie took it. I never heard of him. Tell him we'll be back... bitch. Oi, come here! Oi, you little shit! THEY LAUGH Come on, then, granddad! Oh, dear, dear, dear. Wanker. 'So what were they after?' I don't know. Did they say anything? OK, let's call your mum. She's on holiday. "Dear Reggie. Hotel very nice and clean, food plentiful. "Our waiter's Manuel, like in Fawlty Towers. "Drinking lots of sangria - naughty, naughty! "Missing you loads. "Take good care of your brother, OK? "Back soon. "Love, Mum. Xxx". Do you remember everything? Important stuff. Right. Well, let's call Louise. No! I don't want the police involved. Mum'll go mad! All right. Where's this brother of yours? Let me just clear up! I'm fine, I'll be OK. You came about Jo, right? Yeah. Erm... Andrew Jones is dead. He killed himself, looks like. Looks like? Either way, I'm sure Dr Hunter will be home soon. Why did you join the police, Marcus? Oh, eh... Usual reasons, really. Erm... Public sector pension. Wanted to try and make a difference. What about you, boss? I wanted to hit people with a stick. TEXT ALERT TONE Bloody woman! Who's that? Mrs Michelle Moore. She's run off with some bloke from accounts and her husband's taken it badly. He's one of Brodie's lunatics. You gave her your mobile. He was stalking her. Marcus, you shouldn't do that. Yeah, I know, sorry. It was... Stupid Damsel in Distress Syndrome. Not our problem. Pass it to uniform. Yes, boss. Hit people with a stick, Marcus. And don't give them your mobile. ♪ Seems like to me ♪ Stars don't shine so bright ♪ Seems like to me ♪ The sun has lost its light ♪ Seems like to me ♪ There's nothing going right ♪ Since you went away ♪ Seems like to me ♪ The sky ain't half so blue ♪ Seems like to me ♪ That everything wants you ♪ Seems like to me ♪ I don't know what to do ♪ Since you went away ♪ Since you went away. ♪ Oww! Now, look, that one is pretty. Too short. Right, well, what are you going to buy her, Jackson? KNOCKING Early Christmas present. Thank you, Santa. There might be a weird message on your phone from me. Just delete it. I was very drunk. So I asked around about your new friends. The ginger one's Ian, the tattooed one Craig. Knuckledraggers who work drugs, around Reggie's estate. Reggie's not into drugs. How the hell would you know? Because I know. Nobody knows anybody Jackson. You told me that. Still there. Well, Andrew Jones only used your ID to hire a car, so I figure you're about even. Mr Brodie. Out there. Mr Brodie, she called the police. She's not coming... Wait out there. We still don't know how he got the gun, but he's an ex con, it can't be that tough. Russian's down the pub would have sold him one for 50 quid. You should tell a policeman about that. Guys. Mr Moore, am I going to have to ask this police officer here to escort you from the premises? Have you missed me? Not really. It's been really peaceful, actually. Course I have, you idiot! Every minute of every day. So what have you been up to? Finding people? Trying to find people. Trying not to lose any more. Listen, I wanted to talk about what you've been up to, OK? I've not been up to much. Just having fun. I mean, it's fun out here. That's what I'm talking about. Surfing, for instance, is dangerous. You need proper instruction. I've got proper instruction, Dad. From who? That bloke? Stuart? Yeah, who's Stuart? He's a neighbour. He's teaching me how to surf. He's a one-parent family, as well. We're not a one-parent family. I'm your dad! As soon as I can, I'll come down and remind you what I look like. Marlee! Coming! Right, got to go, Dad. Love you. Well, hold on! Great. "You have 12 million voicemails." 'Where are you, Jackson? 'Last seen in the company of a teenage girl. 'Do you know, I bloody despair of you, man, I do? 'Jackson, how dare you walk out of hospital in your state? 'And how dare you speak to me like that in there? It's not cooked, is it? No, the outside... is cooked. So, 50% of it is cooked! The wine's good. That's only because you brought it. Yes, well, I've got a terrible confession to make. What? I didn't come here for the food. KNOCKING Oh, bloody Archie. Ignore it. No, I can't leave him out there. I can't? Oh, piss off! Sorry, I know it's late. That would be why I told you to piss off. That and few thousand other reasons, which I can't go into now. Yeah. What did I say to you at the hosp-... Hey! What are you doing here? Oddly enough, that was exactly what I was thinking. Are you coming in? Erm... SHE SILENTLY MOUTHS I've brought some rather nice wine around for Louise and I to share. Can I get you a little? Er... Great. She's made some souffle, they're very nice. Have one. Have them all. Thanks. Look... I... I wanted to talk to you about Joanna Hunter. I couldn't get you at the office. Yeah? We should look for her harder. Is this for Reggie's sake? I'm doing it because her husband lied about her disappearing, when he had no reason to. Oh, God. Yeah. Even in the best of marriages, a few white lies are necessary to make life bearable. Really? Your wife disappeared, has she? Are you an expert? My wife died three years ago. Cancer. Oh... I can tell you're feeling better, Jackson. Sorry. I didn't mean to... Just piss off, like I asked you to. Yep. I talked to that lady detective, she said you're nothing to do with the police. Sorry you got that impression. I've been engaged privately. By who? By the nanny? Come off it! It doesn't matter who, what matters is where she is. Look, she just called me, Jo. I just spoke to her. She's in the countryside, so you and Reggie can back off. When did she call? Just now. I was about to call the police. The real police. So where is she? Friends of ours. Who? What's the address? Look, she's fine. It's got nothing to do with you. Goodbye. MOBILE RINGS Oh, shit. Louise. Listen, I'm sorry. I really am sorry. 'It's Marcus. 'Barracuda Chippy. 'Ginger and Tattoo Man hang out there, making deals. 'Louise wishes me to tell you that this is the last thing she does for you.' Oh, well, tell her thanks. But make sure she knows I'm sorry. 'I don't think cares.' Hello, boys. Remember me, do you? Aye, you're the tranny who won Big Brother. Piss off. Pleasure. Right after you tell me why you trashed my friend's flat. Suck your balls, you English prick. What do you want with Reggie? Reggie? You know where Reggie is? You'd better tell me... Leave him! Back off! Get off my balls! Give me an answer. We just want what's ours. Which is? Our gear. Billy didn't pay for it. Billy who? Billy Teague. Please. It's our gear. What did I tell you? Why do you think Reggie's got it? He took it, didn't he? So says Billy. Now you listen to me, you little prick. You go near Reggie or that flat again and I'll have these for earrings. Do you understand? Yeah. I might not be able to have kids now! That's a shame. You've not been telling me the whole truth, Reggie. I have, swear to God. Those lads are drug dealers. They said you took drugs from "Billy Teague". Who's that, your brother? He's an arsehole. So, are you involved in drugs, in some way? How dare you? I'm a nanny, I work in a supermarket, I do ironing and, on Sundays, I work in Mr Akbar's paper shop. How dare you think I do drugs? I've got no time! I've been doing studies and stuff. All right. Look, where is your mum? She's on holiday. That postcard was sent over a year ago. Come on... where is she? SNIFFLING She's dead. I'm sorry. She drowned in the pool. Her hair got sucked into the pump. I got that postcard three days after they told me. But why would you...? I've been trying to act like we're all sticking together, like we did when Mum was here. And Billy? He's my brother. He's all I've got now. Well, he's not much of a brother, if you ask me, sending those two round here, saying you got his drugs. I do. Ms McDonald was coaching me for my A levels. Left me here to study on my own sometimes. Wow. It was in my Mum's room. I couldn't have them there. Ms McDonald can't reach there. OUTER DOOR OPENS He's here. Where the hell are they? Know what they've done to me? Where have you been? You're an arsehole, Billy. Billy, so glad you could make it. Who's he? This what you're looking for? That's my property. Who the hell do you think you are? Morgan Freeman. What? You should never have taken that stuff, Reggie. You should never have put it in Mum's room. What's the difference? Not like she'll find it. It's all that we have of her! It was, until they trashed it. Mum was an old tart. Shut your mouth. She was an old tart. You never seen it. I did. You don't bloody see people. Like Dr Hunter, she's so perfect, eh? I could tell you a thing or... Hey! What do you know about her? Give us that and you'll find out. Tell me... and I might. She's married to a crook. He invited me in once, when I was waiting for Reggie. Asked me to burn down an amusement arcade. He seemed pretty desperate. Did you do it? That would be telling. Just piss off, Billy. Give us that, then. Your brother, your call. Christ's sake, they'll kill me. Enough's enough. You'd better get out of town, Billy - and quick. And where am I meant to go? I don't know. I don't care. Anywhere. Away from me. Are you going to have a go? Go on, give me an excuse. Right, I've had enough of this shite. Get the hell out. You lied about Joanna. You had one of your buildings deliberately burnt down. Is someone threatening you? This is bollocks. I'll call the police. Go on. I've got them on speed dial. Here you go. Turn it off. It's ringing. Turn it off! You've got to go. I can sort this myself, please. Whatever it is, I can help you. I don't want your help. This is my family, I can sort it myself. Jesus Christ! I can protect my own family! Where is she, then?! She's with... She's with Michael Anderson. Oh, shit. Who's he? He's a gangster, from Glasgow. Come on, darling. Come on. BABY WHIMPERS Mummy's here. OK, darling. It's OK. NOISE OF CAR ENGINE Why? I borrowed from him. I couldn't pay it back. I torched the arcade, but there wasn't enough in the settlement. Then the other night, I get back, there's a note from Jo. If I sign over the businesses, I can have her and the baby back in time for Christmas. And you didn't sign straight away?! I was trying to find the money! I was trying to be the man, you know? It is not my house. I don't make the decisions. Don't you make out I don't care about my family. Where are they now? He's not going to hurt her, you know? He's just... He's on his way over. You've got to go. Show me the note. It doesn't sound like they're not going to hurt her. He's just... He's just trying to scare me, you know? Rough me up. KNOCK AT DOOR Christ, they're here. Right, listen to me. You tell them you need proof of life, right? Resist at first and then tell them you'll sign everything if they give you proof Joanna is still alive. Neil? Will you do that? Aye, OK. OK. I'm trying to raise the money. I'm almost there. I can't just click my fingers. Then sign over your businesses. I need to know she's still alive. Sign them over, and you'll know. I need to know before. Then I'll talk to my lawyers. What sort of man are you? Hmm? Twat. Look, I've told you I'll find the money, all right? I just need to know she's alive. Give me a day. A couple more days, eh? It's all right, Reggie, they'll be OK. It's right out in the middle of nowhere. She won't be dead, will she? She'll be fine. You stay here, Reggie. Promise me you'll stay in here. Promise. What if you don't come back? Well, then, you run. BABY WHIMPERING Your husband's still thinking about whether he wants to play. He must love you both very much. So you, you need to write him another note. What do I write? Tell him it'll be you first, and then the baby. I can't write with my hands tied. How's that? AAARGH! AAARGH! Hello? Hello? He's just collapsed. I don't know what... I think he's fainted. Aaagh! What the fuck? I know who you are, Joanna. Who you really are. I've come to get you. Are you going to help me? I don't want my baby growing up with this. Do you understand me? Not like I had. Yeah. What happened? Take her back to the car. Joanna! Hello, Reggie. We missed you. BABY CRIES Are you OK? Uh-huh. Come on. This way. That's better. Yeah. When I saw my family after what he'd done to them, I swore that I'd never run away again. I'd stay. Protect. Sometimes you can't protect people. I can. That's what I do. I feel guilty that I'm still alive. Every day I feel guilty. He's dead now, anyway, Andrew Jones. So, it's all over. Do I know you? You survived, Joanna. You've got a beautiful baby. You can get on with your life now, move on. So you were just wandering around for about a week? I was upset when they told me Jones was coming out. Mmm-hmm. Where were you? I can't remember. "Disassociative fugue state", it's called. Temporary loss of memory due to the memory of a previous trauma. I came to my senses and I came home. Right. PHONE RINGS Jackson Brodie. 'Mr Brodie, it's Gary Moore here.' You've been told not to call, Gary. 'I'm just ringing to say sorry. 'And thanks. And sorry I was a pest.' It's all right. 'I've got it all sorted out now. 'Everything's going to be all right, you'll see.' Good. PHONE DISCONNECTS Jackson Brodie's at the bottom of this, I know it. Well, she's back. Aye, all wrapped up in a nice, tidy bundle. The kind you wouldn't want to tread in. Strathclyde are asking about a crook called Anderson. He's gone missing, they think over here. I've never heard of him. MOBILE PHONE RINGS Sorry. Hello? OK, just calm down. I'm sure he's only saying that to... Don't go down there yourself, Michelle. What's that? My damsel in distress. Don't you run around after her! Just open the door! You're an embarrassment to yourself, and to me. You're a walking embarrassment. Forgive him, he's mental. You're a wee slut! Did you just call me a slut? Open the door! I'm your husband, I'm ordering you to open the door! No, no, no, no, get back in the car. Let me handle this. Taxi for Mr Moore! This is police business. Mr Moore, you shouldn't be here. My wife's here, why should I not be here? Gary... Jackson, leave it! It's time to go, sir. I'm going nowhere. Go on then, off you pop. I'm not going to ask you a second time, go home. I recognise you. I saw you, I saw what you did. I saw you coming out of that house. What? I saw you! Gary! Call an ambulance! I'm here! Look at me, you're all right, you're going to be OK. You're OK. I'm here. You'll be all right. I've got you. All right? You're all right, you're all right, Marcus.

I really can't stay, I just popped by to give you that. Thank you very much. Ah-ha! I've heard it's quite good. I'll go and get yours. Catholics aren't allowed to kill themselves, are they? What? I spoke to Jones's priest. He stopped taking the sacrament after you visited. What did you say to him? I said this and that. You know how it is. Not really, I can't imagine how it is. Well, maybe when he saw me all grown up and with the baby, maybe he thought that's what he deserved. Hmm. He took your baby. Here it is. Here you go. Very kind. Stay for dinner, eh? Jackson, my Jackson? There's plenty. Home grown, except the turkey. Yes, do. Ah, I... Oh, come on. You've no family. You're going nowhere today. Come on. I do have a family. In New Zealand!

No, he's at his brother's. What do you want? I was just wondering... About? The hospital. What I said to you. It was nothing. Nothing important, anyway. Right, if it was nothing important, then what was it? You were rambling, and you told me you loved me. Good. That's about right, then. OK. Is it? OK. Do you want to come in? Have we got time? I don't want to interrupt anything. You're always interrupting something, Jackson. Merry Christmas. I do know you, don't I? From somewhere? 'Joanna! Joanna, come on! 'You should be down there to the right. 'You stay with me.' Over here! Over here, sir! I've found her. Brodie's found her! She's alive. You're safe now. Brodie's found her! She's alive!
