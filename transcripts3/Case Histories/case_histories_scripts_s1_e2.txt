 Case Histories (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 Jackson finally solves the mystery of Laura's killer whilst Shirley,about to make a wealthy marriage,tells him that she feels guilty because she promised to look after Tanya,the daughter of her sister Michelle who was sent to prison for murdering her husband. Tanya went off the rails on discharge from a care home and Shirley wants to make amends. A meeting with Michelle however paints a different picture and Jackson is convinced that Shirley only wants Tanya found so that she does not ruin the marriage. Fortunately a happy coincidence brings closure for Tanya and Theo whilst the Lands' eldest sister,now a nun,throws light on the fate of Olivia. Jackson,however,is perturbed to learn that his ex-wife is leaving,with their daughter,for a job in New Zealand.

 I've been a fool, Jackson. If she hadn't been worried about upsetting my stupid feelings... she'd still be alive today. Are you OK to go home? Yeah. Find him, Jackson. I don't care what you discover about Laura. Just find him. You know him. Don't ya? The old geezer? Yeah, his name's Theo. Is he going to be all right? I think so. Listen, do us a favour, will you?

 Oh, no! I don't want your money. It's not for you. It's for him. Get him some snacks. Fruit and veg and that, something healthy. What's you name? Anna Fields. What's your name? Lily Rose. All right. Thanks, Lily Rose. All right. Oi! The shop's this wa.. Messages? 'DI Munroe phoned, 'said stop asking for Olivia Land files. The answer is no.' Tell her I'll buy her lunch. 'You didn't hear her voice. She won't want lunch with you.' Messages, Deborah! 'Binky Rain phoned seven times.' Um, tell her I'm... busy. Tell her I'm dead.

 'She's your little friend, not mine. 'And there was one other thing.' Yes. What? 'You sound crap.' Tell me it wasn't you who hit me on the head. Who do you think called the ambulance? Last night was fun, but I still want you to find my sister. Then you should make an appointment like everyone else. I'm sorry. Everyone thought Michelle was going somewhere, university, but then she got pregnant and had Tanya. I'm not sure they've got a full case on... I knew they were having problems. 'Keith wasn't a bad man, but... 'Nothing prepared me for what I walked in on that day. 'Nothing.' Michelle? It's me. BABY CRIES 'I can't imagine what poor little Tanya must have seen. 'The blood from Keith's head was everywhere.' 'What happened to Michelle?' 'The last time in ever saw her was in the courtroom the day she was sentenced. 'She refused to see us. 'Refused to read our letters. She refused to see me.' Not that I blame her, the way we were brought up. Dad was a drinker. Mum couldn't control a dog. Baby did Michelle's head in. Can't control babies. Was he violent to her? Keith? Was he? He wouldn't say boo to a goose. That was half his problem. And where's Michelle now? She was released three years ago, but she never got in touch. I don't know where she went or what she's doing now. Look, the point is... I promised her that I would look after Tanya. But I was just a kid myself. I had my whole life ahead of me. And I failed her. MOBILE PHONE RINGS Sorry. Binky, not now, I'm working. Yes. Fine. I'll come round in the morning. Bye. So, you want me to find your sister? No. She has made it obvious she doesn't want to be found. I want you to find Tanya. I'm telling you, Jackson, somebody's been going through my papers! With the greatest of respect, Binky, how would you know? My papers have been tampered with, my private ones. Come on, show me. No, I am not going to show you. What do you think the word private means? I'll step up my nightly patrols. How's that? That's all I ask. Put it down, Amelia, I need a rest. This is going to take weeks. But don't hang around for my sake. You go home. I might stay around for a bit, if that's all right? What about Henry? He can cope. We'll be like two old maids, rattling around the familial home. Ladies... Oh, my hero! You two seem suspiciously happy. I can't help it. I've got a call-back for a new play. Is that good? If the part absolutely demands it, she'll keep her clothes on. Put it down. I've got it. Listen. What's happened to your head? Nothing. Fell over. You have to look after yourself or find someone who will. Look, I've done everything I can. The trail's gone cold. Please, Mr Brodie. Don't stop looking for our sister. Please. Deborah. Where are you on that list of officers who were on duty the night Olivia Land went missing? DI Marion Foster, I served under her. Get hold of her for me. Yes, Mr Brodie. And, er, when you've done that, Michelle Fletcher. She went to prison for murdering her husband in 1994. She had a daughter called Tanya... Sugar? Excuse me? Mr Brodie, my name is Quintus Rain. Rain? Binky's my great aunt. Huh. Two please. OK. My father was Binky's nephew. They weren't particularly close, but he asked that I drop in on her, make sure there was nothing she wanted. Nothing a cleaning company couldn't sort out. I was surprised to find a private detective on my great aunt's payroll. The woman can hardly pay her gas bill. You think I'm ripping Binky off? Personally, I think cats are the spawn of Satan. But that woman loves them. Deborah. Kindly tell Quintus how much money we've extorted from his great aunt. Well, I've sent out six invoices now covering your man hours on the case, travel, food expenses, VAT... Deborah, how much? She hasn't paid a penny, not a bean. I won't ask you a second time, Brodie... Stay away from my aunt. Didn't your assistant tell you? I have absolutely nothing to say to you. One last teeny little favour, and that'll be it, I swear. Wanker. I'll buy you a lovely lunch! You are such an annoying man. So I've been told. So who would want to split your head open, Jackson? Apart from every officer in the Lothian and Borders force, obviously. Oh, and your ex-wife. And me. Ha-ha. A mugging gone wrong. But they didn't steal anything, did they? They got scared. I was lucky. You're never lucky. Can I have a look? This is the very last time I do this for you. Absolutely. Tanya Fletcher was taken into care when her mum got sent down. Bounced around social services, mostly in England... Minor drug offences. Affray, cautioned for prostitution. Did she ever try and look up her mother? Not according to her records. And where is she now? Computer says... don't know. So, tell me, what is it with you and these girls? Listen, Laura Wyre... No, I'm warning you about that. Listen to me, I think she had an admirer. She was a pretty girl. You know, we discussed... A stalker. Someone was giving her presents. Neither her family or friends mentioned any kind of stalker. She didn't tell her friends. She didn't want her father to know. What kind of presents? The kind of presents you give if you haven't a clue about women. Like what? Like a big pink fluffy teddy bear. A man gave me a big pink fluffy teddy bear once. Mind you, he did live with his mother. I found it stuffed at the bottom of her bag. Who gave it to her? I asked her that and I got angry with her, but she wouldn't tell me. Said it wasn't worth it. Ordinary? An ordinary man in a yellow sweater... He gets a lot of visitors but none are male and none are over 20. Countdown's on, Mum! Excuse me, where are you going? I want a pudding, you know! HE RINGS DOORBELL Yes? So when did you first meet Laura? I can't remember. I'll help you out, Stuart. I'm just trying to get a picture of her in my mind. She was a memorable girl, right? Special. So try and remember when you first saw her. There's nothing wrong with seeing someone, Stuart. I was mowing the lawn, and she was in the next door garden with Mr Jessop. I asked him if he wanted me to mow his lawn too. No, Stuart, thank you. Aw, meanie. There's something weird about our Stuart. In his 30s and still living with his mummy. He looks harmless. Aye, those are the ones you need to look out for. She was nice to you. It wasn't just being nice. An attraction, maybe? So did you ever go out or anything? She was too frightened her father would have found out. Right, but if it hadn't been for her father, you and Laura, who knows? That's all I know about it, look you have to go now. Did she like your presents? Yes. Did she? Please go now. I don't think she did, did she, Stuart? If you don't go, I'm phoning my mother. Listen, it wasn't your fault. She didn't understand, she didn't get it. It must have been hard for you, wasn't it? Stuart! You frightened me. I don't know why you're ignoring me. What are you talking about? Stuart, look I felt sorry for you and I talked to you. That's all. Don't fight it. I'm not fighting anything. And please stop buying me presents. You know there's an incredible bond between us, you shouldn't deny it. Look, just leave me alone, will you? My dad's a solicitor and he could make real trouble for you if you keep hassling me like this. Your father can't stop our love. Leave me alone. You took a knife and you went to her father's office. Just to frighten him. No. They wouldn't let you see him, would they? They wouldn't let you get to him and that got you angry, didn't it, Stuart? No. You barged in and you were face-to-face with the man who was getting between you and the person you loved. You didn't even know she was there. You would never have hurt her, would you? I want my mum. Now. Well, you did hurt her didn't you, Stuart? Didn't you? Louise... I've got something for you. She's exhausted, poor kid. Oh, God. His name is Stuart Lappin. The police are questioning him now. Who is he? Just a man. A lonely man, living next door to one of Laura's teachers. Why? Because she was kind, Theo. Because she was kind. Inspector Brodie, isn't it? Elaine. Eileen. Eileen. I'm looking for Shirley Manning. How's the life of a policeman? Pretty bloody, I should imagine. Aw, she's with someone. Lucky bitch. Every woman in here tried to snag him. They're a couple? Professor Welch is her fiance, he's head of paediatrics. Gorgeous, kind and rich. And they're getting married? I'll let her know you're here. THEY WHISPER Why didn't you tell me you were getting married? Would it have made a difference? Of course. Christ, what are you, the last man standing? It was just sex, get over it. Just sex? What? You care so much about finding Tanya that you'd cheat on your partner? Look... I gave you the money, you find Tanya. The rest has got nothing to do with you. You know what? I looked, I can't find her. There's no record of her since she left her last care home. No, please. There are official channels. I've tried those! What's going on with you? Why are you so desperate to find her after all this time? Because I'm getting married. Because we're talking about starting a family. And it made me remember, realise that I have a family. All right. I let Tanya down, I know that. I just want to try and make it up to her, to let her know she's not on her own. Please, just find her for me. THEO CRIES QUIETLY Niamh! Oh, no. Have you got your lunch? Yeah. Take the whole pack, just don't get caught. Thanks. I should have picked her up from the bus stop. You know that, don't you? Yeah. And you know I love you, tyke, don't you? Yeah. Now piss off and learn something. PHONE RINGS Amelia... what's dead now? Because if it's anything smaller than a large horse, I'd appreciate it if you took care of it yourself... 'Mr Brodie, come quickly, you've got to come now...' Calm down, Amelia. I'm coming. I'll be right there. Oh, Binky. In the last 48 hours, someone has coshed you over the head... I'm feeling much better, thanks. ..and now one of your clients is found dead in her own garden. She was in her 80s. Died from natural causes. The coroner will be the judge of that. I'm sorry about Mrs Rain. Am I free to leave? Yeah. Why did you phone Mr Brodie before you phoned the police? Don't worry, I won't cramp your style. Who'd sleep with me when they could have you, anyway? Amelia. I'm going to end up like Binky Rain, smelling of cats, face down and dead in my own garden. That's never going to happen, Amelia. Why isn't it? Because you don't like cats. Milly... Thank you both... very kind... Can I give you a lift somewhere, Jackson? I've got my car, Theo. You just get off home safe. Lily Rose? Can I buy you lunch as a thank you? Yeah, I'm starving. In you go. Bit peckish myself. No fat, no booze, no cheese, no meat. I don't want to see you back here. Hello. Hello. It's a beautiful day. Yes. I've seen you here before. My name's Jean. Jean Stanton. Amelia. Amelia Land. TV PLAYS This is so stupid. 'You care so much about finding Tanya that you'd cheat on your partner? 'Look, I gave you the money, you find Tanya. 'The rest has got nothing to do with you. 'I looked. There's no record of her since she left her last care home. 'No, please. There are official channels. I have tried those.' Come on, Louise, don't let me down. Yes, you beauty! Voila. Enchante, madame. MUSIC PLAYS When will we be there? A few hours yet, it's Yorkshire. No Aotearoa ahau. What? I am from New Zealand. It's Maori. What do you call a sheep with no head and no legs. What? A cloud. What do you call a man with no arms and no legs in a swimming pool? A fish? Bob. That's rubbish. Mum said you had to have me back by five. I know, I'm just going to be a minute. But, Dad, you always say that. And I always mean it. Hello. Can I help you? I'm looking for Michelle. Michelle Fletcher. There's no-one here by that name. What do you want, Mr... Brodie. Jackson Brodie. I'm a private investigator. Your sister hired me to find Tanya. Please leave. No, it's all right, John. Come into the house, Mr Brodie. Where's my sister now? She's in Edinburgh. She's a nurse. And she got in touch with you? She's got engaged. She's thinking of starting a family. She feels like she let Tanya down. She did bloody let her down! She was too young, the baby was taken into care. For a few years, yes. Then Shirley was going to bring her up. That's what we agreed. What actually happened that day, Michelle? I fell in love with Keith when I was 17. Got pregnant, was convinced I could have a family and a career. I wasn't convinced for long. BABY CRIES Be quiet, will you, bug? Be quiet. Her name's Tanya. Why have you started a vegetable patch, Michelle? Because I want to. Just a few courgettes and coriander is not too much to ask, is it? We live on a bloody farm, we're surrounded by vegetables. We live on a bloody potato farm. Shut up! Please ssh. Let me have her, you're going to give her brain damage shaking her like that. No money, a crying baby, you try studying. BABY CRIES Ssh! BABY STOPS CRYING BANGING, BABY CRIES AGAIN SHE SCREAMS Ssh, Tanya, ssh. Put that down, Michelle. Why did I do it? Go on. What I'm about to tell you... I've never told another living soul. Not even John. Put that down, Michelle. You stupid, selfish bitch! You could have hit her! You stupid cow! I hate you! You're nothing! You're not a mother! You stupid... What are you going to do Michelle? You've ruined your bloody life. And Tanya's. You did it. He'd have killed you. I had to. You go. What? Go, Shirley, please. It's my fault you did this, go! I promise that I'll look after her for you. I know you will. When I'm old enough, I'll get her and bring her up. I'm going to phone the police and I'm going to tell them this is how I found you. All right? All right, Michelle? Give her a fresh start, Shirley, be the mother to her that I can't be. I thought she killed him for me, to protect me. I thought she did it for Tanya. All those years in prison... I thought the one good thing was that Tanya was with Shirley... having a decent life. Do you want me to find Tanya? For you? I never loved my baby, Mr Brodie. Does that shock you? Well, you were very young, you were stressed. No. It's better for her this way. There are indications that her life's not been a bed of roses. Drugs, prostitution. That's not fair! Don't you bloody dare play God with our lives, Mr Brodie. You leave me and Tanya in peace. Your daughter plays a mean game of croquet, Mr Brodie. Come out and play. It's fun. I'll make a fresh pot of tea. Mr Brodie was just going. Niamh! Are you all right, Dad? I'm fine, why do you ask? I need to stop at one more place on the way home, OK? Hey, Niamh, this is Marlee, your niece. MUSIC PLAYS Do they play croquet in New Zealand? Only with children's heads, I imagine. It's probably best not to mention those two, John and Michelle, to your mum. Why not? You know... Oi, out! Quintus? It was you. I told you I am not taking money off your aunt, all right?! Sorry. Sorry! I warned you to stay away from my great aunt. Dad? Get back in the car. Awesome. In the car! Hi. Hey. Oh, my God, what's happened? I know it looks bad, but... We went to the graveyard and then I played croquet with a vicar and then Dad beat this man up. A client. OK. Are you kidding? You begged me to let you spend quality time with your daughter, then you take her to work and put her in danger? Course I didn't. But I wasn't in any danger cos Dad broke the man's arm. Oh, OK, in you go, sweetheart, in. He just turned up. You've blown it. You broke into CID?! I walked in. You logged in to my computer using my password? That's true. Do you know I could have you arrested! And what really pisses me off is that you knew what my password was. I sat next to you for years. You should have changed it. Using your son's name and birthday is pathetic. What level of security is that? You're something else, Jackson. No wonder your wife left you. That's nice. I suppose you know she's taking Marlee to New Zealand, do you, does everyone know? Hello, Mr Brodie. I was just passing. DI Louise Munroe, an old friend, colleague. This is Julia Land. I'm helping her find out what happened to her sister, Olivia. I got the part! Terrific. I'll leave you two to it. Very nice to meet you. You do know that the chances of finding anything after all these years is very remote. I have faith in Mr Brodie. Really? Amelia looked a lot happier the other day. That's not happiness, that's hysteria. Has she ever had therapy? That's not really Amelia's style. Have you ever had therapy? I'm from Yorkshire, it's illegal. Poor Amelia. I sometimes think she wishes she was taken, not Olivia. Do you think she blames herself? Her life's been on hold since that day. I hadn't realised quite how much until now. What was she like growing up? She always said she was the least loved daughter. And was she? I think she probably was. You're a woman, Julia. I knew you'd noticed. I met this woman, name of Michelle, been in prison and hasn't seen her daughter for 17 years, and begged me not to find her. Do I believe her? You asked my opinion. Yeah. Well, does she want to be found? Yeah, good question. I didn't ask you to find Michelle! She's Tanya's mother, don't you think she's got a right to know you're trying to find her daughter? She gave up that right the day she killed Tanya's father! If she killed Tanya's father. Look, Keith's dead. Nothing's going to bring him back. Michelle has done the time, society's had its pound of flesh. Listen, my sister is a very devious person, Jackson. If she's spun you some line... Tanya's trying to find you, isn't she? Get in touch with you, isn't she? What? You heard me. I think you want me to find her before she finds you. What are you talking about? I think you're worried some junkie's going to ruin your new life, new marriage. You're mad. You're a liar, a selfish manipulative bitch. You think I'm going to help you. Why are you following me? Hey, why? I'm not. Then why are you running away? You were chasing me. Don't lie. Why are you following me? Piss off! You're not going anywhere. I want an answer. Why are you following me? Tell me. Why? I wasn't following you, I was following her! Shirley Manning? Yeah. Tanya...? Are you? I started off being fostered, but it didn't work out. Then care homes. Did you know what your mother had done? They thought that was well funny. Your mum's a murderer and even she don't wanna see you. And then you came to Edinburgh to find your aunt? What do you make of her? Dunno. What do you make of her? I don't know either. Let's not do anything for a while. We'll think on it. So... what's it to be in the meantime? Lily Rose or Tanya? Lily Rose. Lily Rose it is. Shirley Manning phoned and said she doesn't want to speak to you ever again. Result! Mrs Rain's solicitor phoned again... and said if you don't start returning his calls he's going to subpoena you. I made that last bit up. But it is urgent and he does want to see you. Brodie! Stand up straight, man! Superintendent Marion Foster. Ma'am. My God. Is this what you've become? Get the Superintendent a coffee, Deborah. Black, two sugars. Actually, I was just finishing some... Now. Please. Ummm... Right, yes, Sir, Ma'am. Olivia Land? Were you ever close to catching anyone? Briefly. We thought it was an opportunistic snatch. A couple of neighbours had seen a strange man hanging about the place. But his alibi checked out. What about closer to home. Did you consider the family? I was present at the interviews with the Land girls, but I doubt I've got anything to add to what you already know. Tell me about the father, Victor. Oh, he was a cold fish. Controlled and controlling. The rest of them were a mess, the mother, the girls. I've forgotten their names now. Sylvia, Julia and Amelia. They were strange little girls. Sylvia was the weirdest, although it was quite a contest. In what way weird? She would start to disassociate if you questioned her too closely. She's a nun now. Hmmm. The father just died and I found this in his possession. Blue Mouse! I asked you not to come here again. I showed Blue Mouse to a retired police officer today, very experienced, seen it all. Do you know what happened, Sylvia? My name is Sister Mary Luke. She was shocked and deeply moved. But when I showed it to you... You know nothing about me. Nothing. You must have been very angry at your God, Sylvia. He's not my God. He's the Everlasting Father and I will not have you using His name in vain in this place. SIT DOWN! Please leave me alone. Nothing good can come of... I saw it in your sisters' eyes the first time I met them. The horror of not knowing what happened. Of blaming themselves for not saving her, destroying themselves. And poor little Olivia. No grave her anyone to pray over, nowhere to bring her flowers on her birthday for all these years. Please... Amelia is broken, you know. Julia's lost. And you have it in your gift, Sister Mary Luke... to heal. Binky Rain lived next door to us. We used to sneak into her garden and tease Olivia she was a witch. My father was not everything he appeared to be. On his desk, he had a statue of Saint Joan. He started looking at Olivia in the same way he looked at me. Olivia. Olivia. Get up, come on. Ssh. Don't wake her. I'm the oldest, I should have been here with you. You don't need slippers. Just feel the wet grass between your toes. Come on, quickly this way... I want to take you to see someone. Come with me quickly. You don't have to do everything Mummy and Daddy tell you. Especially Daddy. Except me, because I'm going to protect you. I don't want to go to the witch's house. Don't be silly, Mrs Rain isn't really a witch, that's just a game we play. Joan. Behold, Olivia. OLIVIA SCREAMS Shut up, Olivia, you'll wake up Mrs Rain. What do I do? Sylvia. What's the matter? Oh... I'll get Julia. It wasn't your fault, Amelia. Sylvia did this? No one needs to know. So, it was just instinct that made you look there? Uncanny isn't it? It's a gift. And a couple of things Marion Foster said. And you have no idea how she died or who killed her? No. Can I go? You did a good job, Jackson. By the way, I investigated your Quintus Rain. And? Mrs Rain told him that he was being cut out of the will and being replaced by you. That's insane. Not really. You see Binky Rain was worth a bit, it turns out. And Quintus was right to be worried, you see, Binky changed her will only last week. In your favour, Jackson. How much? Two million pounds... goes to the Edinburgh Cats And Dogs Home. But she left you her most precious possession, "to Jackson for his kindness". CAT MEOWS She doesn't know that we're coming, does she? Course she doesn't. That's it... right there in the left. Is that her? That's your mum. What's she like? I don't really know. She made a big mistake once a long time ago. I thought she was all right. What do you want to do? We could go over and meet her? No. No, I'm not ready. OK. Shall we go? Are you all right, darling? Yes. Yes, I am. KNOCKING Just checking up on you. Well, come in. Amelia. You're beautiful. I want to talk to you... about Henry. I know, you want to get back to him. I understand. He doesn't exist, Julia. You were always banging on about all your men and about me being left on the shelf, so... I made him up. Amelia. There is no Henry. There is no anybody... never has been. Shall we go? Thank you, Mr Brodie. You found our lost girl. Take the whole pack. SHOUTING Francis. Francis!
