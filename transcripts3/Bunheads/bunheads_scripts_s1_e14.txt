We know people who planned their kids' college - At kindergarten. - That's a sickness. You're supposed to leave your keys. I parked my own car. After running it through the valet area. Is that why all those chinese guys Were staring at me? - Hey, claire. - Hi, guys. - Hey, ginny. - Hi, mr. Segal. Where's alice? She's down for the count. She's got this awful cold. Mom has a cold? Can I get you something to drink, claire? I'd love a drink. You just muddle some mint leaves and some lime With cane sugar and orange liqueur And then you add some ice and some rum And you top it all with apple juice. It's a chinese restaurant, mom. They don't do gay marines. White wine is okay, I guess. I'll have whatever you have on tap. White wine is actually great. You're in a chipper mood, claire. I am. Because... I am not gonna let it get me down. Let what get you down? Here we go. Hello, ginny's father is marrying faye mendelson In less than a week. Yeah, we're going. You are? If that's okay? Oh, of course it is. I want you to go, dougie, Really I do. So how's the real-estate business - I hear it's, you know-- - have you seen... That insane wedding blog that they have? - No, not me. - Yes, I have. Many times. Faye mendelson is chronicling their whole stupid life With photographs and diary entries. Gil is surfing now And the man is 45. He's starting to surf. He likes it, mom. And all those photos of faye Cuddling her dog like that, It's just bestial. Call the spca. ( chuckles ) What's so funny? Nothing. I guess. Mom. You're being busted by the valet police. Bring 'em on. Come on, claire. Let's go give them your keys Before this becomes an international incident. All right. You're really going to the wedding, dougie? I mean, I know you knew him first, But he's changed so much. - Wow. - She's on that blog night and day Commenting anonymously. The website blocks dirty words, Or there would be some saucy things Written about those dogs. Believe me. Oh, check this out. What is that? A box? That's my bridesmaid dress. - This has got to be a mistake. - It's not. It's a giant rectangle, why? Because every time I go to my dad and faye's place, Faye stares at my boobs. She told my dad that they remind her Of my mom's boobs and she doesn't want to be reminded Of my mom's boobs at the wedding. So she's forcing me to wear a dress Shaped like a shower curtain. Cruel and unusual. ( sighs ) I don't want to look at it anymore. So where have you been? What do you mean? I mean where have you been? I never see you anymore. I see you every day at school. You're skipping ballet. You don't answer my texts. Dad's got me touring colleges. - Really? - We just got back from driving around U.C. Santa barbara. - Really? - Yeah. Okay, well at least answer my texts. Some of them are even important. I will. I promise. Here. While you have a shot. Good thinking. ( laughing ) Of all the gin joints in all the towns In all the world, she has to walk into mine. "casablanca." I know "casablanca". - Okay. - I've seen "casablanca." I can spell casablanca. I've been to casablanca. I was just trying to be cute. I thought "hey there" would be boring So I thought I'd throw in a-- Never mind. Starting again. - Hey there. - Hey. - For me? - Yep. - Guilt gift? - Yep. I like the wrapping paper. It's my 2004 tax return. Nice. "finding nemo." See? It's the perfect thing for us 'cause you're an expert on the ocean, And I like talking fish. Very nice. Thank you. Sorry for what I said. No worries. I talk, therefore I am. Not always a bad thing. Can I buy you a drink? Yes, you can. Something with bourbon and an umbrella. ( laughing ) What are they celebrating? Tuesday. My favorite holiday. - So guess what I did? - Safer not to. I went online and read your thesis. - You're kidding. - No. ( chuckles ) I'm impressed. Well, don't be. I only understood About 1/10 of it. Plankton. I got that. And your name. And I think you mentioned orca And I did see that movie. Did I mention I didn't finish high school? Points for trying. Guess that alcohol buzz is starting to wear off. Yep. Now they all get tired. And the one on the diet eats every cold french fry She can find. They'll probably leave soon. And then you'll be all alone. Might as well just close. With the whole night ahead of you? How will you fill the time? And then I got into this whole thing With the lady I was understudying 'cause I started dating her husband. They were separated-- well, he said they were separated, But I should have known something was weird When he never let me come over to his house. I had to go to the corner of sixth and 53rd And get in line at this halal cart Till he showed up and dropped a note in my purse Telling me which hotel to meet him at. And since I didn't have a phone number for him, If he was late, I just ordered, And if he still didn't show I had to eat 'cause otherwise I'm weird. Whatever. The point is she finally found out, Got mad and then never missed a show Plus I smelled like garlic sauce the entire run. That is not a true story. Okay, fine, you're right. It was a mr. Softee truck. - ( chuckles ) - scotty? You have flower pots? Who gave you flower pots? What are you doing here? You kill flower pots. And they fling themselves off windowsills. I can't believe this. Are you a lounge singer now? Long stories to have beer by. Wow, I just-- Oh, sorry. This is my brother scotty. Scotty, this is godot. Well, hello, young man. I'm so glad to see you. Come in, come in. Oh boy, I-- It's okay. Another night. It's good to meet you. You too. Seriously? Even mrs. Robinson's Giving you a weird look right now. I thought you were in madison. Well, a funny thing happened on the way to madison. So, madison. Right. So I was on my way to madison And I stopped at this diner And there was a hostess. Not even a waitress? A hostess is a step up from a waitress. No. You're a waitress first and then a hostess. - It's a promotion. - Not at all. Well, she was a redhead So one thing led to another. Oh no. You got married again? - Never made it out of tupelo. I know. I know. How many marriages does this make? - Four? - You're asking me? No, four. This makes four. Oh my god. But you know, she was different. - How? - She spoke very little english. Perfect. But she had these eyes that were epic. I felt if I could just stare in this woman's eyes For the rest of my life, I would be a very happy man. So what happened? Ooh, cake. Well, the first month was great. And then we started fighting, And then we got engaged, Then we fought some more, And then I found out she wore Colored contact lenses. That's when I realized, big mistake. What else was there to think? I'm standing at the altar in my rented tux And she's hurtling down the aisle Like a giant crinoline comet, And I'm thinking to myself, "I have got to get out of this." - So you bolted. - Yeah. - When? - Right after "ymca." Well, you don't want to miss that. So I wrote her a note, I grabbed you some cake, And I exited stage left. Can I give you a piece of advice? If you keep getting engaged to perfect strangers And then bailing on the wedding night, You have to buy a tux. I keep marrying the wrong girl. You keep marrying mom. Well, that's not too disturbing of a statement. Well, if the creepy psychological profile fits. You mind if I crash here for a few days? Couch is all yours. Thanks. Well, so, this is the new pad. It's not what I pictured at all. No? What'd you picture? Something less decorated and without a roof. You're hilarious. How long do you plan to be here? Why, you gonna have your mail forwarded? Just asking. How attached are you to your toothbrush? There's an extra one under the sink. I don't know what problem you had with this girl, But boy, could she pick a cake. I know. I can't imagine what that must have felt like. Hey, I grew up with him. No one knows how flaky he is better than me. Hey, what'd you do to the coffee guy? He hates your guts. Yes, absolutely. Send it all c.O.D. Toss it in a box, tape it up and ship it off. Throw some bricks in 'cause they charge by weight. What are you doing? Getting your stuff. Oh good. I mean, seriously, it's not even remotely heartfelt or poetic. And it just makes him seem way smarter than he is, trust me. Hey, get my purple sweater back. - You have a purple sweater? - It's a very nice purple. - Michelle. - It might make her feel better. Just get the sweater. Mandy, there's a purple sweater? Oh really?

Well, get back out there. Where the hell have you been? - Just out. Why? - Why?! This is not a time to go john gotti on me, melanie. This is a time of emergency. - What's this? - Guess. The bridesmaid's dress. It's a tank with wings and a rumpus room. What's it doing here? If my mother found it, she might chablis-up And take a knife to it. Then you wouldn't have to wear it. - I have to wear it. - I know. Now listen. Why aren't you answering your phone? - Must be off? - Flake city, - I won't have it! - Okay, sorry. You cannot have your phone off From now until the wedding. - It's crisis time, get it? - Got it. Faye mendelson has gone into a total defensive posture. She moved the photo shoot up a week To keep my mother off the scent. Aren't you supposed to do the photo shoot The day of the wedding? When everyone's already there, yes. But faye's not taking chances. Oh, she is going to great expense To make sure my mother doesn't show up. And she's brining a trampoline. Why? I don't know. You'll come with me to the photo shoot? Help with the dress, the makeup, Maybe suicide assistance? Absolutely. Hi, everyone. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. ( cellphone ringing ) Hello? Mom? Okay, how do you know Faye mendelson is getting a massage And left her dog in the car? Are you following her? What does "kind of following her" mean? You're either following her or you're not. No, mom. Hey. - Hi, cozette. - Oh, we're talking. - Yeah, sorry. - No worries. No, she will know who it is If something happens to her dog. She will know. I get what's going on. Group dynamics are naturally resistant to alteration. What is that, like physics? Madonna. So why don't you skate for the team? I thought that's why you gave me the flyer. My brother and I do the music. When you saw me the other day, we were getting our Set list together. The dog is innocent. He's an innocent party. Do not touch the dog! You need a name, you know. For what? A skater name. Everyone's got a name. Oh, yeah. I haven't really thought about it. We'll think about it. My brother and me Named half the team. Leave it to us. So you're walking down the street Away from faye mendelson's car And the dog is fine. Okay. Go home. Chablis-up. I'll see you later. ( phone beeps ) We should get downstairs. Right behind you. I don't think you understand what it's like. Your parents are normal. They do normal things and eat normal food. And even though your mother counts the peas I think that's thoughtful. More thoughtful than wandering the house At night like lady macbeth. You did not forget your shoes. I drove you off. I drove her off just like my mother Drives everyone off. "we mock the things we are to be." You know who said that? Mel brooks. He was talking about how we make fun of our parents And then we grow up and turn into our parents. And that line popped into my head yesterday So I started looking through old photo albums of my mother Trying to figure out exactly when her crazy set in So I can be prepared. I think it started around college. That's the first time I saw her do that Really wild-eyed thing she does. So I guess I've got about three to four years Before I go barking mad Which is good. Now I'm ready for it. I can plan ahead. You know, have a lot of rounded corners in my house. Wear soft, bouncy clothing. Stock up on tissue, ice cream, - Voodoo dolls. - Are you dutch? - What? - Dutch. Are you dutch? - I-- - your face reminds me of a vermeer. It does? "the milkmaid." I drink milk. Michelle: All right, everyone. Butts to the barre. Well, I should get this over there. Hey. Genius is often touched with madness. That's what makes it fun. - Tick, tock. - I guess so. Ow. Come on, let's go. Move move move. Up up up. Come on. There's no one in here you can date. I just thought I'd come watch my sister Shape young lives. I'm just teaching a class. You are just teaching a class. - Stop. - What? You're being a little bit douchey. Of authority before. Except that year You dressed up like angie dickinson for Halloween. Ha ha. Go away. I'm not gonna disrupt anything. - Scotty. - I'm just gonna sit right here And watch you teach. I think it'll be interesting. And possibly hilarious. All right, everyone. First position. ( piano playing ) Demi, straight. Grand plie. Nice. Beautiful. Next group. All right, four turns are not better than three if you fall, dude. Cozette, so good, but I need that hold Before you float through. I'm sorry? You have to hit that arabesque strong. And then square everything off. Then leading with the chin, Arm up and then float through, okay? Ahh. Like this. Yes. Great. Perfect. Nice. Pointe shoes on, everyone. Wow, that cozette, she's very-- - Intense? - And weird. I mean weird in a good way, - But who the hell is she? - Beats me. And why does she bring that sketch artist with her - Everywhere she goes? - That's her brother. Oh, okay. Yeah, not any less weird. Who brings their brother with them everywhere they go? Oh, hey, scotty. This is my brother scotty. Nice hoofing. Making michelle look good out there. Thank you from the president of "I have no coordination Incorporated." So seriously, how is she as a teacher? - She's good. - Really? Accept the answer and go sit down. It is so weird to see you as a teacher. I know, right? Thanks, matisse. You guys have to understand, When michelle was a kid, She hated her ballet teacher. Okay, we're in the middle of a class here. No, it was like a deep deep hatred. An obsessive hatred. And then one night she saw this movie. And it had... Margaret o'brien, - Remember? - No. So, margaret o'brien was this ballet student And she idolized this old ballerina. She wasn't old. She was older And then one day, this other ballerina comes to town And steals the lead in "swan lake" From margaret o'brien's ballerina. So she decides to sabotage the new ballerina By turning off the stage lights, But she opens a trapdoor in the floor by mistake, And the ballerina falls into it. Oh my god, what happened? Paralyzed, wheelchair. To you. To michelle, it was inspiration. So michelle decides to cut a hole in the floor Of her ballet class So that old lady vinshtick Would fall in and paralyze herself. I did not. She breaks in in the middle of the night And tries to cut a hole in the floor with-- With safety scissors and a grapefruit spoon. It didn't go very well. Wow. Okay, shoes back on? Great. Back to the center. Go. - Nice kids. - They sure are. So how much longer you got here? I'm thinking dinner. Don't know. Class, some bookkeeping. You might be on your own tonight. Oh. Echappe, echappe, echappe, pas de chat. Five, six, seven, eight. ( piano playing ) Sonic youth segueing into little richard totally worked last night. As predicted. Lil' wayne segueing into brad paisley did not. Did you know he was country? The paisley thing threw me off. You blending in? - Me? - Yeah you. Trying to. The name will help. Just gotta think of one. - We already did that. - You're gonna like it. But you don't even know me. Yo! Cleo-smacktra, get in here. Cleo-smacktra? Cool. That beaver. He's evil. There's evilness in that kid. At least I'm not late to class today. Good. The hand of lucifer has touched that child. No time for the dressing room though. He played us against each other. How did we let him do that? He caught us at a bad time. I would never call you doo-doo head. You thought I would call you doo-doo head. I didn't know what he was saying, okay? I didn't know what to think. He's bad. I mean, he's just a bad one. And we fell for it. Why did we fall for it? - We're tired. - I'm exhausted. Class is an hour. You and the kids stay in the vicinity, okay? But I thought you were going to bring them all in with you. Carl, I can't. I have class. Well, I've got something too. Something? What something? You don't have work today. I'm going to the gym. The gym. Yeah, it's been, like, forever. You're not going to the gym. I am going to the gym. - No. - Yes. Okay, fine. But I won't be here when you get back. I haven't had time to myself in a week! You knew that kids were a commitment. These aren't our kids. You know what I mean. Carl, please. Fine. I'll skip the gym. But if I lose definition in my glutes, You're to blame, okay? Carl, please don't be mad. Let's start class, losers. Just need to stretch a little first, - Okay, jordan? - Absolutely not. You three, you're my first group. We're starting with pirouettes. And tendu. Fourth, spot spot spot. Two? Two and then you stop.

Ralphs has punch, And vons, and albertsons, Your local pharmacy stocks many punch products To throw on people. Punch is very easy to obtain. Ginny, I am so sorry. I should have told you why I haven't been around. But I got caught up in all this stuff, And I'm sucking at school And my dad is putting college pamphlets on my pillow, And under my breakfast plate, and in my sock drawer. And he keeps going on and on about the s.A.T.S And what I'm gonna major in And what I'm gonna do for a living And what retirement home I'm gonna end up in. And I found this, this... Skating thing, And it made some kind of stupid sense. And I'm just so... So sorry. Say something. You should have been there. Where are we? What is this? It's roller derby. Roller derby? You're in roller derby? I'm cleo-smacktra. ( stammers ) How did this enter your world? That night at the oyster bar, When I pulled the chair out from underneath godot. Godot got you into this? Not godot. She gave me a flyer. She? You! Hi? Should you run? You stay out of this. You're ruining everything! I don't know who you are or where you're from, Or why you know french, or why you're so close with mitch alvarado, But melanie is my friend! And it's the four of us. And you need to stay the hell away! And I'm norwegian! Does she skate? ( whistle blowing ) ( knocking on door ) - Is everyone decent? - Yep. I was yelling your name for 20 minutes. - Didn't you hear me? - What do you want, scotty? I just need a key to get in your place. What happened to the key I gave you yesterday? I don't know. Misplaced it. Is there like a paradise lost and found somewhere? Oh. You're suddenly acting like every other woman in my life. Michelle? You told me the ukulele was lost. You told me to my face that it was lost. It wasn't lost. You had it the whole time. - Who cares? - I do. I wanted my ukulele. - That was like 20 years ago. - Is that your excuse? Oh jeez, I'm sorry. You know, if you missed it that much Maybe you should have just bought a new one. Eddie vedder just did a whole ukulele album. That's how out of ideas he is. - I'll get it for you for christmas. - You're undermining me. Your cracks, your jokes in front of the girls. I'm being funny. It's humor. It's what sets us apart from the apes. That whole margaret o'brien thing. - That was funny? - I can't-- You basically told them to cut a hole in the floor I didn't tell them to do it. I told them that you wanted to do it To your teacher. I thought it was a cute story. - You were planting ideas. - I told them the plot of a movie. I did not write the movie. How the hell am I the bad guy in this? This is my life now, scotty. This is my home. This is my job. Those are my students. Oh boy. You have snapped many many caps, my friend. I'm an authority figure now. - They look up to me. - They're isolated kids. You're this strange exotic creature. You're a mermaid. You're tinker bell. So that's why you're here? To crap all over my new life? I worked hard for this life. You got drunk and married a guy. - Hard work. - Hey! What? I've done it too. No judgments. - You're living in a guest house. - What does that mean? It means, it's a one room guest house. - For a guest. - Oh, so square footage is the measure of stability now? What's your square footage, scotty, huh? Enjoying your six feet of my couch? - Matt johnson. - What? Matt johnson. He was my best friend in school, You dated him, and as soon as you guys broke up He wouldn't talk to me anymore. You said you never took anything from me? You took matt johnson. I have no memory of matt johnson. Oh, come on, michelle. Matt johnson? He was my best friend. The two amigos? Do you mean eric johnson? Yes. Eric johnson. - Wow. - Doesn't change what happened. He was so important to you Perhaps I blacked it out. Too much trauma. - Take some responsibility. - What does that have to do with-- You never take responsibility for anything. Oh, says the girl who set every float on fire At the fourth of July parade with a cigarette And blamed it on rap music. Why didn't you make me graduate high school? - You did graduate. - No. - I was there. - That was the ceremony. I didn't have the credits to get the diploma. Oh, bummer. It was your responsibility to make sure I was prepared for life. - Why me? - You're my big brother. All I was supposed to do was make sure you had beer. Why is this funny? Why are you making this funny? Because all I wanted was a key. That's all. And suddenly you're freaking out And you said ukulele like 60 times And I don't even know why we're having this argument. Don't do that. That is so mom. She starts stuff, and then while you're standing there Yelling and screaming and pulling your hair out, She says "I don't even know why we're having this argument" When she knows damn well why you're having the argument. She's the one who started this argument in the first place. How did we suddenly get to mom? - You brought her up. - I did not bring her up. Well, by being like her, you brought her up. You don't even deal with mom. I deal with mom. Mom needs money, I deal with it. Mom needs to move, I deal with it. Mom needs help hiding out from the jehovah's witnesses, Why was mom hiding out from the jehovah's witnesses? It's a long story and they're a very Non-violent organization so it takes a lot To get them to the point Where they are someone you have to hide out from. Well, that's your choice. I washed my hands of all that a long time ago. Yes, I know. How long's it been - Since you talked to mom? - 12 glorious fun-filled years. Oh, very mature, by the way. Not much has changed. Your address, you go to a job every day, - But not much else. - You don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, it took me way longer to figure things out than it should have, But look at the road map I had to follow. The birds ate all those breadcrumbs, hansel. And boy, do I not want to hear about all the stuff You have to put up with with that crazy woman. Because I've dealt with more than a lifetime's worth of crap from her. Her obsession with her face and her looks, And my face and my looks. And her completely fictional take And if you choose to continue having negative influences In your life, then you have to prepare yourself For the consequences. You know who told me that? Fanny, my mother-in-law. She told me that you make your own family. You make your own destiny. And there is nothing you cannot change If you are completely committed to it. And I am. I am completely committed to it. And it doesn't matter if you believe it or not, The address has changed and my life has changed. - Fine. - I can do this. ( tuning ukulele ) ( strumming ukulele ) â™ª I know I know you belong â™ª â™ª to somebody new â™ª but tonight â™ª you belong to me â™ª although we're apart â™ª you're a part â™ª of my heart â™ª but tonight â™ª you belong â™ª to me â™ª way down â™ª by the stream â™ª how sweet â™ª it will seem â™ª once more â™ª just to dream â™ª in the moonlight â™ª my honey, I know â™ª I know in the dawn â™ª â™ª that you â™ª will be gone â™ª but tonight â™ª you belong â™ª to me â™ª just to little old me. No! Do it again, jordan! No. Again. You're better than this, jordan. Come on. Yes. I'll be better after a banana.
