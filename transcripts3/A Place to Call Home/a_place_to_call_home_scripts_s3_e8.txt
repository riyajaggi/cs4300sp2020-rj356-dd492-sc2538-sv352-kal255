 ♪♪ synced by KoalaNL - with thanks to Phazed-101 ♪♪ Did you sleep with my wife? How could you. I don't want some sordid arrangement. I want you ! I've given some thought to what you said, postponing the christening. No please, you were right. James will return. Is James here? I gotta go to work at Carlo's. Again ?! Yeah, I promised. You're too kind Gino, it's every day now.

 The vines, they're not growing like they should. Gino, what do you mean? They should look healthier. There was a frost this morning. You are a thoroughly modern woman, Carolyn but.. Sir Richard's an old fashioned bloke. Sir Richard is a pussycat. I can handle him. Gimme a kiss. I said NO ! No one says no to me ! The only thing you need, to make you unbeatable, is the right wife. If I may make a suggestion? Remove the tie. I've been speaking to Patrick Kelly.

 He's THE best neuro surgeon in Sydney. The risks are too great. I'm going to have the operation. A remarkable man. He was. And surely, he can be again. Not without this operation, Elizabeth, which could kill him. Roy is out front to take you to the station. I'll see you very soon. You need to take action, George. This new candidate, could be a serious threat to the election. I'm not to concerned about him. He doesn't have any more experience.. He has a blond, pretty wife and all the blokes turn up at the rally, just to get a look at her. It hardly matters. And the ladies turn up, to see what she's wearing. I understand my situation isn't ideal. Then make it ideal, man ! I've no doubt, you could have your pick. Oh, forgive the interruption, Sir Richard. No interruption at all. I've said my piece. The bi-election is not too far away. It's gonna mean speeches, campaigning, shaking hands, kissing babies. You need someone to arrange your schedule. I'll get an assistant. Or a wife. It certainly would be more economical. Would you like to stay for lunch? Or join us at the church, for my grandson's christening? Lunch sounds tempting. Church however, is bad for my health. - I'll see you downstairs. - Mrs. Bligh. Any word from James? No. I left another message at the Australian, this morning. It's gone on long enough, with your campaign about to begin in Ernest. Well, I'm sure, he won't do anything to cast a shadow on that. Miss Olivia? Please, go away. I'm sorry. A parcel arrived for you. I don't want it. No return address. I thought it might be from.. From James? Would you like me, to help you get ready, this morning? Not right now, thank you. "I will always remember you" Lloyd. Please Rose, just leave me be ! Olivia? May I come in? Of course. Forgive me. Are you going to start dressing soon? I can't. Olivia, there's no such word as "can't". How will I stand there? In front of everyone, without James? Everything's fallen apart. Oh, sweet Olivia. This is not your fault. James is treating you most thoughtlessly. Only because I hurt him. Well, whatever was said, it will pass. He'll be here, you'll see. When? But today, is our little Georgie's day. Sorry caro, I just had to finish that chapter. What's happened? They're all dead. Every single one of them. How? We've.. we've been so careful. It's my fault, I'm a fool. No darling, there must be something that we can do. We planted too late. We can buy more. And we can plant them next spring. With what, Anna? We put everything into this. It's over. Everything I worked for. It's alright. Excuse me, could you tell me? That woman's husband? You mean Mrs. Nordmann? Do you know her? I'm a friend, from Inverness, a dismal place, very tiny. She hasn't left that seat, since her husband went into surgery, poor woman. My heart does go out to her. Could you tell me, the moment the operation is finished? I don't want to trouble Sarah, at a time like this. But we are so very concerned, back at home. For the inconvenience. Oh, I couldn't. What was that about? Politics, my personal life. Seems, the two can't be separated. However, for the rest of the day, I just want to focus on my grandson. Yeah, nothing else matters... .. today. You're the nurse, that brought George Bligh in. Oh, yes. I'll never forget your ingenuity. It was most impressive. Are you alright? Eh, yes. My husband Rene, Dr. Nordmann He has been in neuro surgery for hours now. Ah, yes. I saw the name Nordmann on the surgery list. I did wonder. Your husband is in very good hands. Patrick Kelly is one of the best neuro surgeons in the country. It's awful, isn't it? The helplessness, when someone you love is ill. It seems somehow harder for us, when we're so used to saving people. I'd do anything. I don't know your husband,  Mrs. Nordmann, but it seems to me, he has everything to live for. It's half the battle, sometimes. You're not alright. I haven't eaten, that's all. Yes, well, cafeteria food is appalling. But it is possible to survive it, if you know what to order. I have the nurses bring you something. Please, you don't have to do that. I insist. I've laid out your suit, and I've ironed your shirt. For the christening. We can't go to Ash Park, we'll have to head straight to the church. And what am I gonna say to your family, huh? You don't have to say anything. So, pretend everything is alright? No, but.. It was our dream, Anna. We have nothing. I have my trust-fund. That's your money. It's OUR money, and we could invest it in the vineyard, maybe try again and hire some help. We could talk to father about it, at the christening. And say what? I can't provide for you. No Gino, we're in this together. We should talk to him, and.. No, no, no, I would not beg your family. Okay, Anna, we're not going. I'm going to my nephew's christening, Gino ! And how's that gonna look, huh ? Like I'm alone ! Aunt Reggie. Bombs, strikes. News is so very dull these days, don't you think? And what brings you here, this morning? I was hoping, you'd given some thought to our talk. I can't go back, not now. If you need to save face, tell them I dragged you to the car, and tied you to the roof. You won’t give up, will you? And neither should you. One step at the time, my dear. That's how we'll get through it. Here's the little prince-ling. Fed, changed, dressed, ready to go. Thank you Rose. Is the parcel you received, the good news you'd hoped for? It was a christening present. That's all. For all the little ones, who never got a blessing. Has Anna arrived yet? Not yet, perhaps she's meeting us at the church. Two Bligh's missing. It's a wonder, you're not off gallivanting somewhere. Is that what you think of me? Oh, forgive me, I'm... I'm just used to thinking of christenings as being joyous occasions. We're all doing our best, mother. Shall we? Actually I don't think I can.. I can't do this. We're all here, by your side. Are you ready? - James ?! - Oh, at last. Not too late, I hope? Just in time. My sincere apologies, father. We'll talk later. I am so glad you're here. I missed you. Thank you. I assume, you're going to change? We'll wait. I told you it would be alright. Sanctify this water, to the mystical washing away of sin. and grant that this child to be baptised therein may receive the fulness of thy grace. and ever remain in the number of thy faithful.. I baptise thee, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost And I mark thee with the sign of the Cross. Amen. No champagne? Let me fix that immediately. Oh, sweet James. I'm not certain, I'm welcome here. Well, it's my son's christening and I say that you are. To family. To you. Congratulations Mrs. Bligh, on a beautiful baby. Thank you. He's such a mix of his father and you. Yes. And are those long lashes from your side of the family? Ehm, they must be. If you'll excuse me? Isn't it gracious of the Bligh's, to invite us to such a happy occasion? Hmm, what do you reckon, they call this? That a devil on horseback. I don't know whether they eat it or ride it. I want to thank you for bringing James home. He wanted to return. I only reminded him of that. I knew how important it was to you. I'm grateful. Thank you. You don't have to tell me, what you're doing in Sydney, if you don't want to. How long are you going to punish me? I thought you would find that a relief. A relief? The longer I stayed away. Not at all. I will still honor my duties at Ash Park. You don't have to worry about that. Wasn't it lovely? - What? - The christening. Oh, yes. I suppose it was. Anna. To be late for the ceremony. And where is Gino? I'm sorry grandmother, but the whole world doesn't revolve around the Bligh's. For goodness sake. I hear the surgery went well, no complications. They tell me, they won't know his mental state until Rene wakes up. Unfortunately we don't understand the brain nearly as well, as we do the heart. Surgically speaking. You should go home, get some rest. My place is here. There's nothing like a new generation to emphasize how quickly time passes. Thankfully Andrew is in no hurry to make me a grandmother. It must be such a relief to know that Ash Park's future is assured. And that the Jew is out of the picture. If only I can keep George out of Regina's clutches. Is no one good enough for your first born? He simply doesn't see her, for who she is. You must feel some sympathy for her? I mean, Charles was a brute and... ..to have a husband die so violently. Your husband knew the Standish's quite well, didn't he? Yes, he worked for Charles in the diplomatic corps. You know how I feel about gossip. Oh Prudence, I know you're the soul of discretion. Regina never had a shortage of suitors. When her husband fell ill, the rumours were plentiful. I didn't know Charles was ill. Oh yes, gravely ill, the last few months. It was quite a mystery, Even specialists didn't even know, what to make of it. Sarah. Rene. I'm here. It is me. Everything is going to be alright. Yes. Thank you, nurse. I appreciate the call. I think you should slow down. I only meant... This isn't like you. Perhaps I'm not me. Carolyn, what's going on? Christening. There's obviously something you're not telling me. Don't, just don't. Excuse me, Dr. Duncan. There's a telephone call for you, Sydney hospital. Thank you. Oops, sorry. It's alright, no harm done. Carolyn, this is unseemly behaviour, for a godmother. Ow, I'm celebrating my nephew's christening. You're drunk. Quite. A word of warning. The last time you tried to meddle where you weren't wanted, you almost lost everything. What would George say, if he knew you were back to your old ways? If I find something out about your past that I think George needs to know, I shall tell him. Well I wish you luck. There's nothing to find. Excuse me ! Everyone ? If I may have your attention. I'd like to propose a toast, to my grandson, George Lewis Bligh. To George Lewis Bligh ! George, a word? It's too early to tell if it's a full recovery, but he's lucid and his memory seems in tact. Well, they must be relieved. Everyone's found their rightful place. Good news from Sydney, I gather? Yes, Dr. Nordmann's operation was a success. I know that must be bitter sweet for you. If it were me, I might have trouble, wishing my rival well. He's not my rival. I couldn't agree more. He doesn't hold a candle to you. - I'm sorry I overstepped. - Don't mention it. We both have things in our past, George. Regrets, missed opportunities. But you have the chance, to change the lives of everyone in Inverness. Yes, indeed. Regina. I was hasty. It's clear, you would never do anything to hurt James. Your exile is over, if you'd like it to be. You want me to return to Ash Park? With my entry into politics, I must admit I found your... .. your guidance most helpful. Nothing would make me happier. 120 over 80. Couldn't ask for better. Model patient. We'll go home soon. Home? Paris. He only cried for half of it. Shall I put master George down, for his sleep? He must be exhausted. Thank you, Rose. Goodnight. It was a lovely day, after all. It was. I was happy, weren't you? I was wrong, to blame you for what you did. You were going to do it eventually, I see that. It was a stupid mistake. And it will never happen again. Of course it will. How could either of us continue? Livvie, we both want more, than the other can give. What are you trying to say? We're a family, we have a son. Nothing will change that. But we must have our own lives too. I think it's best, if from now on we slept in separate bedrooms. And if I were to tell you, that's NOT what I want? I'll be coming and going so often. Between running Ash Park and trips to the city, I will only disturb you. This way, you'll get your rest. Goodnight. Carlo. I'm sorry Carlo, Gino is not here. Oh, ehm, is it true, the vines are dead? Yes, unfortunately. Frost. I'm a simple man, uh, I was happy to help, but I don't have money lying around, to.. to throw away. I don't understand. Gino tell me, he know what he was doing. And he does, he'll be home soon. If there is to be no wine, I want my money back. Tell Gino we need to talk. Mind you don't scratch the leather. George, may I come in? George? Wake up ! Wake up ! You need to sober up. I'll bring you up some tea. We can't have anyone see you like this. - Where have you been? - The pub. Carlo came here, looking for you. Something about money you owe him. It's an investment. In the winery. So you take money from him, but not from me? - Oh. - Where are you going? Gino, talk to me, please ! Now we're in debt, and we don't have to be ! This is MY decision too ! So, how was it? The christening? It was fine. Did you tell them I lost everything? Did you tell them your husband's a hopeless fool, who... gambled everything he had on a dream and.. .. gone. How much do you owe Carlo? I must have got the dosage wrong. It's forgotten, no one else will know. I trust you're settled? It's strange, how quickly I've come to think of this place as home. Your kindness... has made what I have to say... all the more difficult. I'd hoped, never to have to tell you this. but honestly, I don’t think I can.. stay silent any longer. What is it? Perhaps I can help. I lied to you, George. I lied to everyone. That day, Rene Nordmann shot you, what I told the police, wasn't the truth of what happened. What is the truth? I went riding to clear my head, when I saw you. What are you doing? He was pointing his gun at you. Point that gun away ! Put the gun down ! NON ! I knew I had to stop him. I tried so hard to stop him. It was intent. He wanted to kill you. He almost DID kill you and the thought, that he will never have to pay is almost too much for me, to bear. Why did you lie? I'm not blind. I know how much Sarah means to you, how much you value her happiness. If I told the truth, Rene would still be in prison or... ..worse. I thought it's what you would want. Regina, what you did, shows such loyalty. - No. - Yes, of course. I didn't do it out of loyalty. I didn't do it, to spare Sarah Nordmann pain. Can't you see it, George? I did it because... ..I would do anything for you. Brought you something to eat. And some coffee. Thanks. Ah Bella, leave it please, I'll do it. I can help. Visiting hours are over. I'd rather stay, if that's alright. The patient needs his rest. I understand, but.. It's hospital policy, I'm afraid. I won't bother anyone. I need to check on Mr. Nordmann's progress. I make us a cup of tea, I won't be long. - You wanted to see me? - Yes. How are you feeling, this morning? Much better, thank you. And thank you for your discretion last night. - Please. - And your honesty. And now, I would like to be honest with you. Your loyalty to this family, is genuine. I know that, I know that your feelings toward me, have guided your actions in the past. I also know, that you'll stand by me, no matter what. - It's all true. - Please, let me finish. This may not be the future you want, but I would like to propose, a partnership. You know what it means, to have a political life. You know what you be getting yourself in to. What exactly are you suggesting, George? A marriage... .. of sorts. Sir Richard is right. I need to declare myself as a man with serious intentions. The sooner, the better. So, is this a proposal or a business deal? Both. And I believe, we'll both benefit greatly. We'll be partners. - Partners? - Politically. We can take on this challenge together. For the good of the country. You'll be my right hand. That's all? Sorry, I know it's not the most romantic of proposals. Regina, we've both been married before. And where did love get either of us? Well George, you've taken me quite by surprise. I don't know. I have to think it over. Of course. What is it ? Shall I set a plate for you at the breakfast table, Mrs. Standish? Yes, thank you. I'm ravenous. Sister ! - Stay back. - No, let me help. Doctor’s doing everything he can. Let me go there ! There's no pulse. He must have haemorrhaged. Pupils aren't responding. He's gone. No,, Rene ! GET YOUR HANDS OF ME 1! Please don't leave me now. Please Mrs. Nordmann. Please, it's no use. He's gone. Are you sure? Thank you, nurse. How very sad. I'll let Mrs. Nordmann's friends here know. Forgive the interruption. Not at all. I've given a lot of thought, to what you said. And? You need someone by your side, when you launch your campaign. The female voters will want to see, that you're stable, committed, married. I want to stand beside you as your wife. That's wonderful news, Regina. Thank you. I don't need a big wedding. Let's do it quickly, so we can focus on your campaign. Together we can give the new candidate a run for his money. You see, already you're making it clear, this was the right decision. George, what's all this about? I appreciate your support, in my recent endeavours, and I hope, you'll support me in this one too. Regina and I are to be married. Congratulations, both of you. Thank you son. Yeah, that's wonderful. It won't be anything grand, just a civil ceremony, for the family. And the press, of course. Sir Richard has smoothed the way for us. Dear Dickie. Everyone in this family has lost their minds. George, I should like to speak to you, in private. Of course, mother. I will NOT allow this to happen. Mother. Is she blackmailing you? Please calm down, your heart ! We're getting married, because we both want to. Sir Richard wants you to. And he's right. If we wait until later, it will appear contrived. We've received a special dispensation, we are to be wed tomorrow. Well then, Carolyn is right, you have lost your mind. If that's how you see it, that's your choice. George, can't you see? You are being manipulated ! Give me some credit ! I'm not an imbecile. I know you're not ! This is MY decision ! I would like you at the wedding tomorrow. But if you can't be there to support me, then so be it. You can't marry her. You don't love her. - Love isn't everything. - Of course it is. You're young and happily married. I hope you never have to understand what it means to... .. be practical It'll be a small wedding, no pump and ceremony. If you'd like to be there, you'd be most welcome. Goodnight, both of you. We'll find a way, won't we? We will. I should never have let you go through this. And now, we are apart, once again. It's time, sorry. Time? - To take him downstairs. - What for? For the autopsy, so the surgeon can determine.. No. - It needs to be done. - I don't care. - I understand you're upset. - You're NOT taking him. I'm SO very sorry. If there's anything I can do? I lost him once before, and I grieved for him. I don't know how to do it, a second time. I can't even imagine. No autopsy. We're Jewish. He needs to be buried as soon as possible. I'll let them know. How will I find you now? He isn't going through with it, is he? It seems that he is. What are you going to do? I don't know. Seems we're not as in control of life... ..as we'd like to think. - Are we, mother? - No. But it's how we respond to life's surprises, that counts. I do hope that eventually, you'll tell me what's bothering you. One day, perhaps. Darling, whatever it is... .. have courage. You've always been such a brave woman. More than I can say for myself. Not so brave. Of course you are. More than you know ! I know he's in, I have to see him. One moment, please. Sir Richard, Miss Bligh is here to see you? Yeah, alright. He wants you to go in. Good to see you, sit down. Now, did you bring the proposal? I think it's a bloody good idea. I don't care about my proposal. Well, what am I paying you for? You're not, I resign ! Don't be such a dill. You won't get away, with what you did to me. And what exactly is it, you think I did? I imagine, the police will call it rape. Hah, don't be such a bloody child ! Excuse me ! Well, you invite me into your apartment... ..drunk, wanton. If you've changed your mind, that's not my problem. That's not what happened, and you know it ! But you're hardly the Virgin Mary, I didn't do anything, you haven't done before. I will go to the police. The press too, if I have to. Who will believe you ? Who will take your word, against mine? They'll call you a tramp. Drag your name through the mud. Ruin your brother's career into the bargain, hmm? Why don't you go back to Inverness? Back to your country doctor. You're not gonna make it here. Ash Park. Good afternoon doctor Duncan. I think he's just leaving, I'll go and fetch him. Mr. Bligh, a telephone call for you, from Dr. Duncan. I'm afraid, we really don't have time. Ah yes, tell him I'll call him back, when I return. After the wedding. Yes, Sir. Drive quickly, I cannot wait to become the next Mrs. Bligh. I call upon the persons here present, to witness that I, George Robert Bligh, take Regina Margareth Standish to be my lawful, wedded wife. I call upon the persons here present, to witness that I, Regina Margareth Standish, take George Robert Bligh as my lawful, wedded husband. Congratulations, I now pronounce you man and wife.
