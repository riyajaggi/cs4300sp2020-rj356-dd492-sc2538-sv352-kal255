 You've made me believe in you. Really? You're engaged. Do you think I'm gonna let some wop farm boy have her? I thought I'd have to work to get you. I did love you. And I loved you. I don't care what it costs. Find something that will rid us of her forever. I used my body. They used it. How can I marry without telling him? See, he's a man. Don't risk destroying this.

 What could be found? The full story of what happened to me at Ravensbruck. To hear it from anyone else would be the end of us. I got through it by going somewhere in my mind. Somewhere far away. I feel as if it happened to someone else. But it happened to me. I feel so... I should have told you before. It has to affect how you see me. I won't let it. I won't. I'm so sorry. I've come to terms with it... ...within myself. Well, it seems rather poor timing, I must say.

 It's for one night, and he'll check on James before he goes. And the reason for this gathering? It's my annual pre-Christmas bash for glorious misfits. The reason for Jack to go? It may help him understand James. He'll certainly see that his kind come in all shapes and sizes. Well, I think it's a marvellous idea. Sarah agrees, don't you? I don't see it can hurt. Avoiding facts does more harm than facing them ever does. George. Sorry? I'm interested in your opinion. I'd rather not discuss it. Fear not, Mother, I'll send Jack home unsullied. Have you known men like James, Miss Adams? I have. Oh. So you've mixed in the demimonde? Not really. They're found in all sorts of circles. I'm aware of that. Well, perhaps one day you may enlighten us about your clearly colourful past. Do I detect a certain tension between yourself and Miss Adams? Stay out of it... please. James. James, wake up. It's alright, darling, it's just a nightmare. You're home. You're here. You're safe. It was dreadful. I was hitting him. Who? Again and again with my fists. I was hitting our son because he's like me. It was just a nightmare. If it's a boy, my grandfather and me, William on your side of the If it's hereditary... You're upsetting yourself. What would you do if you knew before he was born? How would you feel? Stop it! I would love him like any other child. Really? How could I not? He comes from our love. Lie down. Sleep. Doris is on a decorations frenzy. I'm getting out before I end up draped in tinsel and holly. Problem? I'm here to help with yours, I hope. I'm sure everyone's asking for time off over Christmas. I'm juggling it. Just. I'll take as many extra shifts as you need. Won't you be expected at Ash Park? Well, given my faith, I'd rather be with my patients. Surely George wants his... He understands. Well, his loss is my gain. Yes. I want you to drink all of it. Well done. Excuse me. I love you. That will never change. I-I don't want to, but I keep seeing you... I can't keep these images out of my mind. You can't imagine what it was like. I'm sure. But I see you... with all those men. There was no pleasure. There was only violence and horror. I feel such anger. But I will come to terms with it. But can you marry someone with that in their past? I can't let you go. Don't come back until you're sure. This is too painful. So what do you reckon, Mrs Bligh? Oh, well, you certainly have the wherewithal for a real schoolro Thank Mr Bligh from the men. We're very grateful you've offered to teach them. I do hope Mrs Duncan doesn't mind us taking your spare time. Ah, there's no Mrs Duncan, ma'am, just footloose and fancy free me. Then we don't have to worry. Ah, we know that it's mostly your doing. So thank you, ma'am. I'm glad for the chance to be as busy as my husband is with the property and his affairs in the city. Good day. Ah, Mrs Bligh, before you go. Merry Christmas from the men. Oh. You said that roses are your favourite. I don't think you've got one like it. Thank you, John. I have just the spot for it. It's Jack, ma'am. To most. It's a beautiful rose. It is. A fine hybrid. However, I suspect you're not here for a lesson in horticulture. No. I thought you should know I'm moving into the hospital over the Christmas period. I'll be doing double shifts. Oh. I see. I know what you're doing. And I've told George the worst that can possibly be told. Nothing Regina unearths can hurt us if we weather this. Merry Christmas. When we settled on your three months with us, I foretold that you would decide its outcome. I'll only be gone a short while. Will you? How may I help you, Mrs Duncan? I apologise, being a total stranger and all, um, but I didn't know where else to turn. It-it's about my Jacky. He's named after his father. I know things didn't end well here with Jacky's dad. It was a long time ago. It was. I've gotta tell you, though, he often spoke of you, and well. Things have been hard since he passed. Ah. I'm not looking for a handout, not for myself. But Jacky's a real clever lad, and he'll go far if he can stay at school. I don't have the money. John always said that you cared about that sort of thing, so I... I understand. And what would you like to do with your life, Jack? A clerk perhaps. What if you could do anything? I reckon a doctor, ma'am. A few more days and James should be back to rights. Good. He's following conversation again, he's stopped drifting. Thank you. I'll give him another once-over as soon as I'm back from Sydney. Please don't return spouting any of Carolyn's nonsense. If she and Miss Adams had their way they'd see James in some bohemian menage. Well, what if that's what he wants? He's a married man expecting a child. He's chosen to embrace his family duty. Fair enough. Hmm. No doubt that woman's been in your ear already. What, Sarah? My best efforts have been met with paranoid ramblings. Any tensions are of her making. Have you two had a stoush? Jack, if we discuss it, we'll disagree. I don't like it when we disagree. You never have. No. Come on, I've got your Christmas present in the car. Oh. Don't think you've got one like it. What? Oh, your timing is... Thank you. It's been a tough year. It has. Look at us, eh, still friends. Oh. Always. Merry Christmas, Jack. Is that...? Taken from last year's gift, yes. Thank you for all the work you've been doing with the men. They've made wonderful progress. We've done well, haven't we? Yes. You don't have to do that. Well, you can't leave everything strewn about. Oh, Jack. It's OK. You know how I feel about you, you must. I... You feel the same way. I know you do. It's wrong but you do. I can't give you what you've got but I could make you happy, and you're not. Come with me. Come away, Elizabeth. That's Mrs Bligh. How dare you presume to know what constitutes my happiness! You will go to the overseer, Mr Duncan, and offer your notice, or I'll go to my husband and have you flogged off this property You love me. You know you do. Go. Now! Grandmother? Is it James? No. Me? No. I know I've disappointed you. Whatever our differences you know I'll always love you. Well, that is a comfort. What is he doing here? I invited him to join us for Christmas. How could you? Anna, you've never given him a proper chance. Promising start. Gino, it's not fair. Anna, don't cry, please. I don't want to go to Darwin. At least you get to see your papa. I'm not allowed to see mine. Why did they lock him up? 'Cause he's Italian. You should go. I'm going to marry you when I grow up. Don't be so soppy. Andrew Swanson's here. And he's staying for Christmas. It now makes sense why she made us delay the announcement. There's no need to be jealous, she's just making mischief. He should know the truth. Maybe it's time he did. Why she'd invite him under the circumstances is beyond me. He knows you've been unwell. He won't be curious. I meant the circumstances with Anna. Oh. Some sort of last-ditch effort. Sure you're up to this? It's a good test. Andrew. Olivia. Radiant as ever. We are so pleased to have you with us. A great improvement on dinner for one. Mother's with an aunt I can't abide. There's nothing worse than being alone at Christmas. Good to see you on your feet, James. It's good to be on them. Father speaks well of Dr Stewart. Certainly dried him out. Not that I'm implying... Oh, of course not. How is Sir Henry? In London, trying to outrun the scandal. And there we shall draw a veil over unsavoury matters. Sarah's not joining us? She's at the hospital. George's intended. I met her at the engagement party. Of course. Well, Christmas means little to those of her faith. I hope we're not late. Welcome back, James. Uh, Anna says you've been sick. I'm much improved. Thank you. You know Gino, Andrew. You've met. Not in person. How are you, old boy? What happened to you at the engagement party? You disappeared. Andrew has difficulty focusing on any one thing for too long. Anna. It seems your granddaughter has me pegged. There are exceptions, though, when I find something worth focusing on. Well, I'm afraid to say that dinner is about to be served. Gino has come with an invitation for us. This year Father Joe would like to invite all faiths to our midnight mass. Our family would like to invite your family to share it with us. I'm going. I think we all should. Well, thank your parents, but I think not. What about you, old boy? I've always wondered what sort of blood sacrifices you papists get up to. You can't let him go on his own, Grandmother. As I said, dinner awaits. There must be an extra chair for my fiance, surely, even without his generous invitation. That's one piece of news I hadn't caught up on. We're announcing it after Christmas, but as we're all here en famille... I see. Nothing like a long drive to give a man an appetite. - Shall we? - Yes. I'm just not playing her game anymore. Very well. As long as it's done with respect. James, when you're up to socialising again I must show you both some hospitality. Well, it might be some time before we're back in the city. When you are. Well, thank you. And for being so kind to Livvy while I was unwell. She's fine company. Perhaps you could join us. We'd love to. Wouldn't we? We would. Perhaps a visit to the cinema. I'd love to see one of the new widescreen films. CinemaScope. I find it rather like peering through the slit in a letterbox. Well, you'd know, Andrew. I've become rather a fan of the foreign film lately. The last one I saw, oddly enough, was called 'Anna'. Oh. Italian. How intriguing. The story of a dancer torn between two men. Full of murder and cruelty. Crazy lot, you Italians, if your films are anything to go by. Passionate. The main thing I've learned from Italian films is that when an Italian gives his heart, he gives it truly. Such a hopeless romantic. Hopeless. Was that exhibition absolutely necessary? You brought it on yourself. You don't understand, do you? He could do your reputation irreparable damage if he so chose. In the world of debs and tea parties maybe. That's not my world anymore. It never really was. The irony of your rebellion. I wouldn't mind all this nonsense, Anna, if you were fighting for true independence, but you're simply tying yourself to that boy's stove to dutifully deliver new little Polettis on an annual basis. Foolish, foolish girl! If you'd prefer your privacy, sir... I don't understand. What? Why you're still interested in Anna. She's engaged. It hasn't been announced. It will be. I'll throw in the towel if you prefer. It's not up to me. I simply don't see the possibility of your success. We shall see, sir. Yes. I hope you don't mind. As a matter of fact, I do. The time for games is over. So, Anna Bligh... ...would you do me the honour of becoming... Andrew, stop it. ..of becoming my wife? What? Get up. Stop being silly. I thought you'd appreciate the romantic approach. I'm engaged. Come now. You don't love me. You interest me, which is more than I can say of anyone else. You've run, I've chased. Now you stop, I catch. I've been caught. The joke is wearing thin, Anna. It's no joke. You can't be serious. Yes, I am. A good soldier never retires from the field. Keep it. I won't change my mind. You won't marry him. You won't dine with a monkey at your table every night. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle... ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the... ♪ Your behaviour has become impossible to ignore. I didn't ask you to come after me. You're not driving like that. None of your ruddy... Let's get you to bed. You're not my mother! I did not give you everything to stand back and watch you turn into this. You don't know. Well, how can I help you if you won't tell me? Tell me! Bloody Japs. Bloody Japs. Oh, God, what did they do to you? Jack, trust me. Take my hand. Take it. Now stand up. Come on. I refuse to see you in the gutter. This is going to stop and it's going to stop here and now! You be a man. Just a tick. Yes. I just need your signature on these and then you're free to go. Do you have everything you need? Yeah. Even packed my feather boa. Hmm. Then according to Elizabeth, you'll be right at home. What? Oh... maybe I should stay. James might need me. James will be fine. I can't imagine you won't be enlightened in some way. And entertained. Yeah, I guess it does give me something to talk about over Christmas pud. There you go then. Sarah. Moving in here? It's temporary. I hope so. ♪ I know a gal A wonderful gal ♪ She's the sweetest gal in town ♪ You can search for miles around ♪ But no-one can be found like this one ♪ She has a smile that will open your eyes ♪ With a certain little way ♪ And every time that you get near her ♪ You look at her and say ♪ A red-hot momma ♪ A red-hot momma ♪ You're the one I need... ♪ I was starting to think you'd lost your nerve. ♪ A red-hot momma, a red-hot momma ♪ Yes, indeed... ♪ Hope I didn't interrupt anything. Harold? Oh, I'm not his type at all. Oh. Not like that. He likes the dusky ladies. Right. They, on the other hand, do like men, dusky or otherwise. Carolyn, darling, a triumph. Brian, this is my dear friend Jack. Pleased to meet you, Brian. Oh, no, no, no. Tonight, darling, it's Mary. Mary Christmas. Nice? Excuse me. Oooh! It's one thing to have an eye for a bloke, but why do they have to act so bloody flamboyant? Let's broaden your horizons. George, your unhappy mood is becoming obvious to our guest. You invited him. Miss Adams has confided in me that you and she are grappling with certain revelations that she's made. I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't express my hope that it will bring this misalliance to an end. It won't! Jack, Charles. Charles, Jack. Jack's a doctor from Inverness, my dear friend. Charles is a divorce lawyer. He does all the best people. In the nicest possible way. Ah, Elva darling, meet Jack. Jack, my wife, Elva. And you are? Gorgeous, aren't you, sweetheart? You're married. In the nicest possible way. One win, three losses. Disappointing performance. Don't worry, we'll get them next time. Doubt it. You can't blame Solomon for the loss. The poor bloke was ill. Taking on the Saffas with crook guts is madness. He's too young to be captain. I bet you weren't saying that when he scored that try at the death against Fiji last year. That test was a nail-biter, alright. I'll never understand the fascination you lads have with football. Not all football. Just rugby. Anyway, that's me done. Look me up when you're next in town then. Caro's got my address. Yeah, will do, Wally. Good on you, mate. Don't get your hopes up. Hmm. Bye-bye. What's so funny? You just made a date. He's not. He is. But he just seemed so... normal. All shapes and sizes. Were you tempted? No. So no matter what they want you to be you are who you are. Of course. That's exactly the way James feels. James wants to change. Only because he's been told he should. He should be free to live his life without shame. What, like Mary Christmas? Like all of them. I don't think Elizabeth would ever forgive me if I got James waltzing around like Carmen Miranda. But it's his choice to make. Although maybe not the bowl of fruit on his head. You're serious. Olivia deserves better than a compromise. Any woman does. Yeah. What? Nothing. It's late. We used to stay up much later than this. Yeah, well, we're not that young anymore. We're not that old either. Carolyn... The way I felt back then... it hasn't changed. Not a day's gone past... OK, I should go. What just happened? Nothing. Was it what I said about James? No, no. It was something. Just forget it. There's a perfectly good bed right here, Jack. Merry Christmas. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jack? Wait! James, aren't you supposed to be sleeping? 'Jungle Man' - I should have known. He could beat all the rotten old Japs, Mummy. Daddy will keep us safe. We don't need him. You've been very good today, haven't you, little one? No kicking to disturb Mummy. Did you hear what Andrew said? Hmm? He said I looked as if I'd stepped out of a nativity play. What's that? I was testing myself, seeing if it nauseated me. And did it? Quite the opposite, actually. Brought back some happy memories. My mother used to catch me reading comic books by torchlight. My favourite weekly was 'School Friend'. I would devour it as soon as it arrived. Under the covers? Only if I hadn't finished by bedtime. You see, no-one wore a loin cloth in 'School Friend'. I'm sure. I do feel like Mary in a way. I'm carrying all the hopes of our little world inside me. That sounded very silly. Not at all. Goodnight. Soon it will all be like it was a bad dream. That's what Father said. There's something we need to do. With Father. Tomorrow. Is this really necessary? Yes. I don't mean to be cruel but something needs saying and I need to say it here. In Olivia's condition... I'm fine. If it helps. I hope so. All my life I've been running and I want it to stop. This is where I kissed Harry. James... I wouldn't be saying this if it wasn't necessary. We've put all that behind us. No, we haven't. That's the point. We can't until you both accept who I am. No more talk of... of bad dreams. No more sweeping it under the carpet to avoid the fact that I will always be this. I tried changing. I can't. Then how do we proceed? As husband and wife, I hope. As parents. As father and son. I made marriage vows, I'll never betray them, but if I did, you have to accept it would be with a man. Oh, son... The only way I can move forward is by facing the truth... ...and then moving beyond it. Then we face it. Father? And move beyond it. Yes.
