 Douglas Goddard telephoned. Seems he's trying to chase you down. Well, if you're not doing anything this evening, perhaps we might have dinner. Can you write? Why don't you show me what you can do? Write me a critique, a review. I wanted to thank you for today but, I am a happily married woman. How often do they have to be watered? Every day for the first month. Why were you working at Carlo's? Lie down. I've changed my mind! Linda's very sick, Nancy. She needs to go to the hospital. Hysterectomy at 15. The uterine wall's perforated.

 The man was a butcher. He should be struck off. I don't know how I'm going to tell Rene about the baby. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. You can't avoid me forever, you know. If you had any decency, you'd leave. Is that what you want from me? Decency? I have a husband. You do. Darling, the portrait. Truth be told, I'm not convinced the artist is a good fit for us. His style, I'm worried it's too modern. Well, I think Lloyd's a decent chap, and I trust Aunt Carolyn's recommendation. He makes me feel uncomfortable. Darling, it's natural to be shy.

 Besides, I want a memento of this happy time, so I'm afraid I'm putting my foot down. Acceptances are flooding in for the little prince. Whom, I believe, needs changing. Rose, would you mind? Come here, my handsome lad. Hey. Bye-bye, Georgie. Bye-bye. Bye. Ah. How's my bonny boy this morning? Good morning, George. Good morning. Good morning. Morning. I trust you slept well? I won't take any this morning. But the doctor... Is not here and I'm sure would agree I'm in good health. Besides, I want to have my wits about me from now on. I've seen the flyers in town. Mrs Collins has been very thorough. No telegraph pole left untouched. It's not premature? You haven't received the official nod yet. The emphasis on 'yet'. It's a forum, not a political speech. If I'm to represent the district, I want to know their concerns. Spoken like a true statesman. I don't want a nurse. I want a wife. You have a wife. Rene, please. It's been days. I know this is a difficult situation, but I can't change what's happened. We're having a baby. No! No, you are having a baby. I thought you were dead. Jules Manet, he saw you shot in the head, trying to escape! You did not wait for me! I did! I went to the station every day, searching for you, for news of you, mon amore. Don't you dare question my love for you. You have no idea, the things I did, to survive, to be with you again. I wish you had never found me. Thank you. A politician. You must be so proud. Well, there remain a number of hoops to be jumped through. Not according to Sir Richard. A little birdy tells me that you've been giving private recitals at Douglas Goddard's soup kitchen. Refuge. And, yes, music does have proven benefits, as you could witness for yourself, if you paid a visit. My dear, I'm run off my feet selling tickets to the ball. But how Bolshevik of you to roll up your sleeves and muck in. I intend to propose to the committee that we raise funds for unwed mothers next. Well, aren't you the suffragette. Look at you, you're wearing purple. Next you'll be throwing yourself under horses. Can't you smoke around the back with the rest of the staff? Well, you'd know all about the tradesman's entrance. Aren't you chirpy! Let me guess, George managed to look at you without retching. So, how is your precious country doctor? A little unsettled? The poor creature did pale somewhat, digesting news of your sordid past. It's not surprising, really. Your cavalcade of ex-lovers would make a streetwalker blush. If you cross me when it comes to Jack... Indeed. That's how I feel about George. Sweet James. Such a sensitive boy. What are you saying? I think it's clear. He's so vulnerable to scandal and innuendo. Carolyn? Carolyn. He's busy, Carolyn. Carolyn! Good morning. There is something that you need to know... He's still recovering. Be quiet! Regina is using James's secret as a weapon to ensure her continued presence at Ash Park. She is threatening to expose him. It sickens me and I will not tolerate it. How could you say such a thing? Do you deny it? Is this true? George, you know I love James. I would never do anything to hurt him. Is it true? I don't deny the charge. But you must hear the context. Without, the words are monstrous. What I said about James, it was that terrible night I sought refuge here after that... brute raised a hand to me. What are you talking about? Don't believe her, George. Let her speak. You saw me. I was petrified. I was not in my right mind. I regret saying it now but I was sure you would turn me away. This never happened! You know how much I adore James. I am ashamed I said such a disgusting thing. It was a hollow threat, born of terror. I'm so very, very sorry. George, this is lies. She made the same threat to me only two minutes ago! She has always hated me... Enough! You know that I would never deceive you... That is enough! I will never presume to come between blood. Carolyn is your sister. You must stand with her. I will return to the farmhouse. That would be your decision. I stopped by the Kirkpatricks'. And I want to pop in to the Aboriginal mission. Tilly Harrison's having her fifth child. I'm concerned she's hypertensive. Do you remember that bastard's address? The one who butchered Linda. Jack. The thought that he is doing it again, right now, to some other poor girl... You did everything you could. And you've lied on Linda's death certificate. To protect her honour. And by doing that, I'm protecting him. I know. I'll just sign paperwork, shall I, while another dozen girls are dumped outside Crown Street, bleeding to death. Oh, Gino! Look, it's our invitation to the christening. How lovely. We're not going, Anna. If this is about James... I told Carlo I'd help him with the harvest. Why is his farm more important than ours? Bella, trust me, what I'm doing here, it's for our future. You said it wouldn't be like this. Like what? Like your parents. Working all the time. I'm so tired, Gino. If you weren't up all night, writing your novel... That's the only chance I get! Why are you getting like this? Huh? You knew you were marrying a farmer. I am black and blue, thanks to your incompetence. You found every pothole between Ash Park and this godforsaken dump. If you think you're getting a tip, then you're more stupid than you appear. Excuse me! A long-distance call, please, Mildred. M2248. Sir Richard Bennett. Mrs Poletti to see you. I was just thinking about you. Tea, please, Rose. I hardly see you now you're Mrs Poletti. Anna, what's wrong? Is it Gino? He's not unwell, is he? Oh, I wouldn't know. I never see him. Oh, come and sit. He would be so angry that I'm here, but I didn't know where else to go. Angry? Why? Livvie, it's just all such a mess! We fought tooth and nail to be together and now it's as though we've turned on each other. Surely, it's not that bad. No, it's worse. Something always needs chopping, or scrubbing, or watering. And Gino spends more time at Carlo's farm than ours and I have no idea why, and I just wonder if our marriage is cursed! Ever since Andrew Swanson and that loathsome letter. Letter? No, I didn't come to talk about that. Anna. What letter? It was just Andrew being hateful. What did he say? He just made up the most horrible story about you and baby Georgie. That he isn't yours. That he was bought at the hospital. Oh, Livvie, I'm so sorry! Please, just forget I said anything at all. I know that you were close to Andrew, so this will come as a shock but... Please, Livvie. Oh, darling, look at me. Oh, god. Thank you, Rose. We can manage. Are you sure, ma'am? It's no bother... That will be all. Thank you, Rose. Does James know? Olivia! You... you don't know what it's been like. Please don't judge me... How could you do such a thing? I did it for James. Our baby... Our baby didn't live. And... I couldn't tell him. The thought of being a father was the only thing that saved him in that dreadful clinic. It was the only thing that kept us together. Olivia, you must tell him. Anna, I can't. James adores baby Georgie and you. He will forgive you. No, he won't. Nor will his father, nor will his grandmother... Olivia! You need to tell them. You don't understand. You couldn't wait to free yourself from the Bligh name but for James, it is the most important thing in the world, and this would destroy it. I know I have committed a gross deception. Introducing a bastard child... Don't! Oh. Oh, Anna, I'm sorry. I... If you have any regard for me, for your brother, I implore you, say nothing. You've seen how happy Georgie makes him. Anna, don't put his health at risk. I don't know what else to say. If you could just find it in your heart to forgive me. If you can't... James is at the stables. # Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross # To see a fine lady upon a white horse # With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes ♪ She shall have music wherever she goes. ♪ What's that, Georgie? It's the horsie. The horsie. What does the horsie say? Horsie goes 'neigh'! Look, it's Aunty Anna. Georgie says 'Dada' now. Don't you, little man? Livvie says he's blowing bubbles, but Daddy knows better, doesn't he, Georgie? Can you say 'Dada'? Da, da, da, da, da. Da, da, da, da, da... I didn't tell him. Thank you. How do you do it? Keep such a secret? I honestly don't know. Do you even know who his mother is? I am. Anna. You won't... you won't tell Gino, will you? Did she leave alone? She didn't take any staff with her? She's always alone, isn't she? That woman has no friends whatsoever. Certainly no female ones. Have I put James at risk? Well, there's a chance of winning George's affection, however slim, I don't think she'll play that card. But tread carefully, Carolyn. You've stirred a rattlesnake. That ought to hold her. You should have a spare, but. Thanks, Roy. Mind you, a pair of the wife's best stockings tied together'll do the trick in an emergency. I used to get Larry-Do when I did that, though. Your wife would yell at you? Too right. But she knew who was head of the house, right? Oh, yeah, and it weren't me. Really? Mate, when you get to my age, you learn not to take things too seriously. Yeah. Anna, she doesn't understand. I want to make a good life for her, and our family, God willing. Speak of the devil. Hi, Roy. G'day, Miss Anna! It's lovely to see you. Would you like to come in, have a cup of tea? Nah, I'd better get a wriggle-on, thanks. I'll see youse directly. Thanks, Roy. Where were you today? You know where I was. I was at the vines. After that? Anna. I was at Ash Park. I went to see Olivia and to see baby Georgie. What's wrong? Ah, bella. We'll have a baby of our own one day, just like Olivia. Gino... You cannot be serious. Thanks, Bunny. You're welcome, sir. You're a girl about town. You know what I'm talking about. Sexy young bohemians doing sexy young things. But we discussed that I was to do art pieces. This is a bloody art piece! I want to know what happens in the bars and the alleyways after the exhibitions, not boring waffle about the damn paintings. And give me the dirt on those boozy openings of yours, without getting me sued, of course. And if I refuse? Our arrangement is terminated... which will make a certain member of your family very happy. Regina. Ain't she something? Oh, hello. Is it Monday already? I'm not coming on Monday, or any other day. And yet, here you are. Come in. Your behaviour is utt... James, what are you doing here? I'm having my sitting. Now? Yes, now. I must have my days muddled... Oh, join us, if you like. I normally only do one of you at a time at this stage... No, no, I'll leave the two of you to... Sorry to interrupt. So, James, how about a drink, my good man? Oh, this'll work fine. No. I can turn that out there into a bit of a sleep-out. So there's plenty of room, if that's what you're worried about. Thanks, Roy. Still early days. Yeah, course. Well, that's enough of me rabbiting on. I'll leave youse to it. You can just tell Jeeves to turn out the lights. Goodnight. Goodnight. There's a new hospital, the Prince of Wales. Word is, they're looking for nurses. Why don't we move? Start again, just the two of us. It's not like you to run. I'm not running. I'm trying to do what's best for us. Why add to the strain, by living so close to... Say it. "To George." It's no strain. We both know I'm not well. My head. I could die... Don't. Living here, when I'm gone, you'll be cared for. Don't talk like that. Don't talk of death. This... this baby is life. Remember how much we wanted a family? Rene, look at me. I'm having this child. But if you can't learn to love it, then we have no future. Darling, I know I mentioned this earlier but... the portrait. I really do think we should inquire about another artist. Just admit it. Admit what? You don't trust me alone with him. That is not true. Isn't it? Of course not. Oh, come on. Why were you there? Because I don't believe you forgot what day it was. A message for Lloyd, from Carolyn. Some party or other. It wasn't important. Just stop lying. Fine, then. I was thrown to see you there. You hadn't mentioned it. Why should I mention it? It's a family portrait. Last time I checked, I'm a member of this family! You are deliberately goading me. It's better than being disingenuous. You would know all about that! Are you accusing me of duplicity? What am I supposed to think? I have worked so hard, behaved beyond reproach! You've concealed things from me in the past. I can't believe what I'm hearing. It always comes back to that, doesn't it? No matter how much you say it's behind us. You are the one who is being defensive, James. Because you're stalking around in the bushes, spying on me! Now you're being ridiculous! Do you know how embarrassed I was? How humiliated? Don't speak to me about humiliation! Humiliation is having a husband who can't stand to touch me! James, wait. Don't leave. James! James! Take him to the nursery. Yes. I thought you might like a cup. I let it steep for a good while. How's Georgie? Still asleep. He's been grizzling on and off. I think he might be teething. I'll keep an eye on him, Miss. I don't mind. He's such an angel, even when he's cheeky. You do so much already. It's no bother, really. I'll be downstairs if you need anything. May I? Darling, of course. I'm so sorry. So am I. James... It's not true. That I can't stand to touch you. Not like this. You wanted to see me? It's from Nancy Brent. She thanks us for all we did. It meant a lot to her that you were with Linda at the end. Give me his address. I've got nothing on today that can't be moved. Promise me you'll let the police handle it. I will. And don't use your name. I'm not stupid. Sarah, I need to see this bastard is taken off the streets. I'll cancel both our appointments. No, it's too dangerous. Jack, I know the address. And I'm the only one who can identify him. You were right. Lunch is a much better idea. I don't know what I was thinking, inviting you out to dinner. Oh, I see there are a number of new additions to the menu since I last dined here. One should always be up for new experiences. Too early for champagne, hm? Oh, tea will suffice. Hm. A few minutes more. And some tea, in the meantime. And a bottle of your '36 Pommery. Two glasses. Certainly, sir. Ah, excuse me, ma'am. You can't go in there. Sorry, sir, she... You're late. You needn't bother firing me. I know the outcome. Alice was her name. How long ago did she die? October 28, 1921. Same day my son, Frank, was born. Same time. Hm. Raising a child alone is no easy task. Shames me to say, I was never very close to the boy. I...I blamed him for his mother's death. To be honest, I all but abandoned him. Well, children can be very forgiving. It's never too late, surely. Frank died in Borneo. A week later, the Japs surrendered. I never realised what he meant to me. Perhaps that's why you were moved to open the refuge. You see your late son in the men. I reckon there's something in that. Police! Open up! There's no-one there! Been empty for years! Thanks, love. Must have the wrong place. This is the house. Why don't you break the door down? Why don't you stop wasting our time? This is the right address, I'm sure of it. They're in his pocket. Hey, come here! You're not goin' anywhere. Let me go! Is this the guy? It's him. He's down here! You bastard, that's assault! Arrest him! Oh, let me go! The police are refusing to arrest this man! He's been performing abortions and women have died! I know you. Alright, clear off! I haven't done anything! I have to cuff you, Don. Let me go! OK, settle down. Calm down. I haven't done anything! See you in court! I spent most of my life trying to control my children. I didn't want them to grow up. But I put order and discipline first. Carolyn essentially severed all contact with me for years. George has displayed a surprising capacity for tolerance but, I've, um... I've hurt him terribly. Is that why you're at the refuge? Doing penance? Perhaps. Oh, dear, aren't I a cheery companion? You're a fascinating woman, Elizabeth. Please don't presume to know me. Will you consider the piano a donation? I must go. Thank you for lunch, Mr Goddard. Goodness me. A house call. Spontaneous appointments, the latest in modern medicine. How terribly unconventional of you. How is my Lois Lane? Oh, you'll be pleased to know that I've just handed in my first and last piece to Sir Richard. It won't see the light of day, but it was immensely satisfying nonetheless. Best explained over a cocktail. So, does this mean I'll be seeing more of you? You'll be sick to death of me before the week is out. Never. I'll make sure you're too busy to miss the city. She's gone out for lunch. You're back! So it would appear. Hello, Elizabeth. Hello. What brings you to the city? Uh, a seminar. Everything alright? Oh, just a slight headache. If you'll excuse me. Of course. Cup of tea? Forgive me, Papa. Good day, George? Oh, it's just fine. Thank you, Gino. I appreciate this. Good to see you, Gino. James. Darling. Reggie. Regina. I...I won't intrude, but if I may make a suggestion? Remove the tie. Hate to say it. Yeah, she's quite a turnout. Old Doris. When she does something, she does it right. You can wait in the truck if you like, if you feel more comfortable. Hello? See? You are beautiful. There's so many. Yes. I, uh... I got a little carried away. What is this? Oh, it's you. I would never pose like that. Wouldn't you? You have bewitched me. As some of you may be aware, I hope to represent the Country Party in the upcoming election. Now, my family has lived on this land for generations and the soil is as familiar to me as... as my own sweat. Not very familiar, then, eh? You are right to be sceptical. I...I was fortunate to be born into wealth. Tutto bene? Why not share it round? I intend to. But let's start with improving the infrastructure in this district. Those roads. They're impassable after the rain. It makes it impossible for any of us to get our stock to the markets. If I'm to be your representative, I will bring Inverness into the modern era with the introduction of the latest farming methods. So, I want to facilitate a farm bank where we combine our resources to purchase the latest farming equipment and we share in their upkeep and use. Well done. And the loss of our young men to the city in search of work - this has to be stemmed. And it can be stemmed, with the creation of local factories. Now, some of you may have heard of the Fletcher Jones model, where workers own shares in the company. Therefore, they directly benefit from the company's success. Now, why can't we have one of those here for the future of our own sons and daughters? If I win this pre-selection... What was I thinking? What? James will be back any minute. It's alright. It is not alright. It's fine. Nothing about this is remotely alright, or fine. Oh! Where are my shoes? Come here, alright? Lloyd, this is... What have I done? Where is my damned shoe? They're probably where you threw 'em. Now, admit it, Carolyn. You're disappointed your journalistic career's at an end. Would have been nice to see the views of a woman validated in print, for once. I really don't want to talk about it. How was lunch? I really don't want to talk about that, either. Well, I might go for a walk. Need anything? Ah, 'The Chronicle', if you're passing one. You're upset. You like him, don't you? It's neither here nor there, since our acquaintance is at an end. You don't have to repeat history, you know. You do have choices. We all do. Carolyn, please don't patronise me. Whisky? Hmm. I'll try to be him again. The man I was. I see you, my love. I do. I don't believe it. He's published it! "'Beware the Friendless Female', by Carolyn Bligh. "We've all met them, those carefully painted women who seem to care. "But, ladies, look closely. Does she have any female friends? "I mean, real girlfriends, "the ones who take you out for a night on the tiles when he breaks your heart? "Dig a little, and you'll find she's completely alone. "Not a female friend in sight. "Because behind that eyeshadow lies a calculating mind, "obsessed with only one thing - getting that chap at any cost. "And don't think she'll stop at just the man. "There's the family estate, his cars, his horses, his staff. She's insatiable, ladies." Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
