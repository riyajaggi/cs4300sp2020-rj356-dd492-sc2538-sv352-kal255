 A Place to Call Home (2013–2018): Season 1, Episode 5 - Day of Atonement - full transcript 
 With a religious occasion approaching, Sarah performs a spiritual cleansing in the local creek that's unfortunately witnessed by Doris Collins. While Sarah finds it hard to deal with Doris' reaction to her nudity, it is Sarah's own personal demons that she is struggling with most.

 It's too much. It is a very generous gesture. Sir Henry has a son. Quite the golden-haired child. And? Perhaps they're looking for the right girl. Anna? Do women really have such thoughts? Yes. Doesn't mean that we should do them. Before we got married, I was in love with someone.

 Someone totally wrong. What could have made him love someone who is so wrong for him? I need to see who she is. That woman made a promise to James, and to me! She saved his life. And now she threatens to ruin it. My husband was Jewish. Rene died... in Dachau. Anna's gone out, of all days! Mother, will you stop fussing? First impressions, George. Can't we just enjoy the weekend? Well?

 Apparently she's out riding. Oh. You made it. How was the journey? Long. I must say, the roads around here... I know. I know. Now, you see, if you were a local member, George... Oh, darling, you promised. Incorrigible. It's been too long. It has. And finally, we get to see Ash Park. Not before time. And James. Oh, my goodness. All grown up. And married! My wife, Olivia. Lady Swanson. Prudence, please. The reports weren't wrong. An English rose, indeed. Andrew, what are you doing in there? Can I answer that in polite society? He will have his little jokes. Nothing more sinister than needing a refill. So... you, I'm guessing, would be Anna. No. Unfortunately, Anna's been detained. Charity work. At the hospital. Your mother won't be happy. I'm making a point. I think you should go back. You don't want me here? It'll seem rude. I'd much rather be here with you. I'd much rather you were here, but... Look who it is! The dago hound dog! Whoo! Sure you want a real Aussie? Looks like dago hound dog's got the scent of a pedigree bitch! Whoo! Do you know him? Bert Forth. He used to work for you. Did he? Your dad fired him. Why? Why do you think? Alright. Don't go picking a fight. After what he said? Please. Gino, promise me. I promise. Think I should have made my point by now. I'll let you know how it goes. Good luck. Alma said you wanted to see me. Sit. Close the door. Look... As doctors and nurses, the human body is something we deal with every day. There's nothing shameful about it. You were seen... swimming in the creek. I wasn't swimming. But you were naked. Different actions have different meanings in different contexts. Do you always have to be so mysterious? Do people always have to jump to the wrong conclusions? It's a country town, Sister. People talk. All too often out of ignorance. Would it help if I explained to the offended party? I'm not sure it's a party you're inclined to explain to. Mrs Collins. Miss Adams. I was hoping to speak with you. Yeah? Look, I know we didn't get off to the best of starts. Perhaps we can forget all that and begin again. What's brought this on? Tomorrow is Yom Kippur. For people of my faith, a time for various rituals. One is seeking atonement from God and our fellow man. Oh, so this has nothing to do with being spoken to by Dr Duncan about swimming nude in broad daylight? It's one of the rituals. It's a Mikveh. A what? It's a ritual cleansing, like a, um... Well, it's like a baptism. Nothing like any baptism I've ever attended. Well, if it caused any offence, please accept my apology. Let me offer you some advice. Next time you feel the need to indulge in one of your strange religious frolics, do so somewhere more private. I'll keep that in mind. Good. Thank you. Good. Ah, thank you, Amy. You didn't have to do this as well. Yes, the gramophone was more than generous. Prudence. Sir Henry. Thank you. I had a hand in it. Thank you all. More records. There's little point giving someone a gramophone with only one record to play. Can you... buy records in this part of the world? I rather assumed not. Mother. I think we all grasped your intention. Inverness is still without a music store of its own, so thank you. It's mostly good music. Plus a few contemporary ones. Hank Williams. Andrew. You heard of him? I told him to leave that one out. Don't be so stuffy. Well, it's inappropriate. May I? 'Your Cheatin' Heart'. We give them 'The Anniversary Waltz' and he gives them a song about infidelity. I call that poor taste. He thinks I'm old-fashioned. Could this be your daughter? Greetings, all. My darling. Finally. Ah, Henry. Good morning, my dear. And Prudence! Sir Henry and Lady Swanson. And you must be Andrew. Pleasure to meet you. I've heard so much about you. I've heard so much about you too. Darling, wouldn't you be more comfortable out of those riding clothes? No, I like trousers. Oh, good. I'm parched. All that charity work? So exhausting. How long have you been sitting there like that? Not long. You look a bit down in the dumps. I'm just thinking. About forgiveness. Righto. No, thanks. Aaahhh. Aahh. That's the doctor. Has it got anything to do with your Yom Whatchy? Yes. Let me see if I've got this straight. You go around apologising to anyone you ever done wrong by, and from sundown tomorrow you do bugger-all. You don't eat or drink, and you're just meant to pray and feel miserable all day. That about it? In fairly broad terms, yes. I got that from Isaac Gold. I doubt he'd put it quite like that. What it boils down to. It's the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Seek forgiveness. Seek to forgive. You just tell me what I have to do and I'll do it. Anything to help. Someone who acts as if it's vaguely normal. If it makes sense to you, it makes sense to me. I guess it makes you feel close to your hubby too, eh? Yeah. Like Anzac Day does me the boys. Rene and I were working for the Resistance in Paris. It was just before Yom Kippur that we were arrested. 1942. That was the last time I ever saw him. Is that beer still going? I'll get you a glass. # The way a fool would do # Madly # Because you held me tight # And stole a kiss in the night... ♪ Please, James. Take it off. # Heart and soul # I begged to be adored # Lost control # And tumbled overboard # Gladly... ♪ We have guests. They gave it to us. They're waiting. Thank you. I've been thinking. About? Our child. His name. I thought we decided, assuming it's a boy. I'm not sure William is appropriate. It was your idea after your father. And my brother. Do you mind if we don't call him after William? Darling, whatever name makes you happy. Better check what my errant sister is up to. So you're not intent on the name William? I said so, didn't I? You look exquisite. You can't be serious. Why? What do you mean? Honestly. It's an old favourite. No, it's just old. And you're not being the least bit subtle. One can't please everyone. Grandmother will see right through it. Mmm. It'll make her even more determined to bring you to heel. It was bad enough being dragged around London like some trophy. I'm not going to let her start that here. She sees it as her job. This is Australia 1953, for goodness' sake. And she's manning the barricades against change. Why? So we women can continue to have dismal choices forced upon us? Andrew Swanson is hardly dismal. That dress, however, is. What happened to making your own choices? He doesn't seem that bad. That's all. Come on. It won't be the first time the royals have visited our shores. But she'll be the first reigning monarch. The festivities around it will be marvellous. She's so radiant. So young. They're not coming until next year. He thinks there's something wrong with being excited about seeing one's queen. I didn't say that. You would have been there for the coronation. Oh, it was splendid. You attended the abbey? Hardly. Olivia's parents were there. Of course. They're related. Yes, they are. Distantly. We'll go in to dinner as soon as... Ah, here they are. Well... Aren't you a sight to behold. I believe I'm on your arm for the evening. Shall we lead the way? Please. I'm going to kill her. I'll take that as a compliment. Sorry. I've been living on me own too long. Thanks. Suppose you'll be wanting to get a place of your own now you've decided to stay. Suppose so, yes. You are staying, aren't you? If I'm not run out of town. By Doris Collins? Among others. She probably thinks we're living in sin. No doubt. Doesn't bother ya? She already thinks I'm a pagan. Bugger the lot of them, I say. Why not stay on here? Permanent. Ray, that's a very kind offer. I didn't say rent-free. Not much of a palace, but... Lucky seems to like it. Anyway... you think about it. No rush. Oh, aren't the flower girls divine? Olivia's nieces. Six and four. Oh, charming. Oh. And the best man. Do I see a family resemblance? My brother. So handsome. And you met James through him? She did. Oh, so romantic. I'm sorry. Would it be rude of me to retire early? You're not unwell? Simply tired. Oh, you mustn't stay up on our account. We'll see you in the morning. Sleep well, my dear. The first 12 weeks. Yes. What is it with old men and cigars? What is it with young men and cigarettes? No, thank you. Horrible things. Have you always lived here? No. I was a boarder in the city. Before you went to Europe? Yes. But you prefer it here? I should get back inside. You know, I loathe these silly games as much as you do. A ride before breakfast? Why not? Amy? Yes, ma'am? Has anyone risen yet? Yes. Mr George and Sir Henry are out walking. And Miss Anna... Where is she? Out riding... Oh, for goodness' sake. With young Mr Andrew. Oh. Ah. Ma'am? Yes. Someone here to see you. Miss Adams. This is ridiculous. She said she's happy to wait at your convenience. Show her in. Tea for two? For one. I can't imagine what brings you here at this unreasonable hour. I hoped to see you before work. I would like to clear the air between us. I'm not your only apology of late, I hear. Some sort of religious rite, am I correct? I assume you mean Mrs Collins. I did speak with her yesterday. I'd prefer an expression of genuine regret, rather than a ritual obeisance at the time of year for atonement. This is genuine. Your timing, however, is suspect. So tell me why exactly you broke your promise to me. At the time, my intention was to return to the city and... But you did promise to keep what happened to James strictly between ourselves. Quite solemnly, as I recall. What does your religion say about that? Mrs Bligh... Why did you come here? A few ritual platitudes and you're away, with your conscience salved. It seems to me your atonement is rather a hollow affair. A life is more important than a promise. I was worried for James. He had my shoulder to lean on. He still does. He needs his father's too. He has that now. I don't know if it's to do with your faith... but there's something very lost about you. A wandering Jew can clearly be a very dangerous entity. I should leave. Yes, you should. Are you alright? It's nothing. Perhaps you should sit down. It's nothing. Go! Now! Where's Mr Bligh? At the sheds, I think. See to Mrs Bligh. Did she ask for me? She needs you. 10,000 head. Impressive. You can see why I don't have the time to spare for politics. The next time you're in the city, let's have dinner at the club. There are some matters I'd like to discuss that are best got into away from the frivolities of the ladies' romantic machinations. Mr Bligh. Excuse me. Ah, another one of the local distractions. I'll keep walking. Sarah. My visit's upset your mother. She seems unwell. She should see Dr Duncan. Thank you. Mr Bligh. Ah, George. Reverend Green wants us to select the hymns for the service. I just saw Sarah. She thinks we should call Jack. She's wrong. No, really. I took a pill. I'm feeling much better. No thanks to her. She's worried about you. She came here to ask for forgiveness. The Jews, honestly. I know they gave us the Old Testament, but some of their ways... It is Yom Kippur, Mother. It's all Greek to me. Elizabeth, George. I'm told Andrew and Anna were up and away early. Riding. Oh, isn't that nice? How is she? Oh, she seems fine now. I know you have guests. Don't let her take on too much. Thank you. I'll try. Not many in your position... would care what happened to her. Well, I'm partly to blame. For apologising? She took it as a ritual gesture. I doubt anything less than a full acceptance of blame will satisfy her. She'll never have that. I didn't think so. So I'm going to have to be somewhat discreet... if I'm to see you without giving my mother conniptions. Wouldn't it be better if... I am there to visit the dog, though. Ah, the dog. Yes. I'm finding our guests somewhat wearing. How about tonight? I'm at the Goldbergs and then no pleasure until sundown tomorrow. I am flattered. You consider my visit a pleasure. Of course I do. Tomorrow night. I'll look forward to that. Good. So this is your eastern boundary. Just down there. Whose grapevines? Italian family. After the war when they were freed, Father gave them some freehold. Freed? Enemy aliens. Of course. Any good? They're lovely people. The wine. Oh. You ever tasted any of it? Some. Not that our local wines compare with Europe's. No. Not yet, anyway. Is that the maker? I might like to have a word with him. No, we're late for breakfast as it is. I thought we agreed to enjoy ourselves. He's not the maker. His father is. I'll race you back. Andrew. You play well. Oh. It was considered an essential skill when I was a young girl. Does Anna play? Times change. Well, goodnight, then. Oh, stay. I was just about to retire. Please. We haven't had a chance to speak all day. How was your ride this morning? We raced. Anna won. Both ways. I didn't mind at all. Of course. I like her. I'm pleased to hear it. But I don't respond well to being... played any more than Anna does. So we should step back and let nature take its course? Yes. And that course might be? Is there anyone else? Another man? No. Oh, trust me. The field is open. There isn't anyone around here remotely suitable for her. I thought there might be. It's the way she's attracted, but holds back. I often find that in attached women. Absolutely not. You sound quite the Lothario. I've lived. Are you trying to shock me? I'm just being honest. I will keep in touch with her. Who knows? And you. Do you play? The piano. I retired when I was seven, having mastered 'Chopsticks'. Ah! Pull up a chair. You may regret this. Nothing like a good duet. He's awfully handsome. Sorry? Andrew. If you say so. Don't pretend you haven't noticed. Not particularly. You men. I certainly have no problem admitting another woman's beauty. Unless she's competing for the same prize. Andrew isn't competition to you, is he? I didn't think so. Then why be so coy? Darling, I'm trying to read. My brother never had that problem. In fact, I distinctly recall his reaction upon meeting you. "Charming and handsome." Those were his words. Now I'm beginning to think he is. Is what? Who? Andrew. Competition. Come here. Darling... there is no-one in the world more beautiful or charming than you. It's time to sleep. Goodnight. Gino! Gino? Come on. Take a rest. Waited for you all day yesterday. Well, I couldn't get away. You been having a nice time? Hmm? Well, it looked like you were. We were discussing the vineyard. He's interested in winemaking. Should have introduced us. Well, he's not stupid. He would have sensed it. Us. Oh? Smart as well as rich, hmm? Your nonna's chosen well. I make my own choices. But he likes you, hmm? And you like him. No, not especially. Not especially. No, not at all! You're being childish. I'm speaking to you. Well, at least he has manners. What you reading? Oh. Sorry. I didn't mean to pry. No, it's fine. Poems. I think I might go for a walk. Mind if I have a squiz? A bit of a poet meself. Of course. Lorca. He and Rene were friends. He was shot during the Spanish Civil War. Whoo! Hey! The dago hound dog! Hey, Gino! How's it going, mate? Well, that's not very friendly. Hey, how's that little bitch of yours? She still on heat? What'd you say? I said, "How's that little bitch of yours? Is she still on heat?" Come on, mate. Come on, mate. Come on, dago. Have a go. Oh, you need a bigger target, mate. Ohh! One more for luck, hey? Hey, Gino. Gino. Smile for me, buddy. Stop it! Ah! Are you alright? Bert, can you hear me? What happened? Get out of here! Hey. You just got beaten by a girl. Shut your bloody gob! Crazy bitch. Who started it? I wasn't there. It doesn't matter. Still reckon you should report it. If he doesn't want to. Finished. For now. No hard yakka, at least for the rest of the day. You should have seen the way she downed him. I'll be out in a moment. Just as well Doris wasn't there. Skinny-dipping, now public brawling. Believe me, I didn't want to. Taking on Bert, though. Where'd you learn how to fight? I got lucky. Really? Yeah, well, you watch Bert. Doubt you made a friend there. Almost time to break the fast. Almost. How'd you go with your forgiving? How'd you go with the poems? Oh, what do you reckon? That's Spanish, hey? Yes. Can you read that? Yes. What about you give us one? In English. This was Rene's favourite. Righto. "Tell my friends that I've died. "Tell them that I'm out here in the sky, my eyes wide open. "My face covered up by this endless blue shroud. "That I've gone off, empty, to the stars." Rene used to say it reminded him of his friend. Now it just reminds me of him. Excuse me. There you are. Just finished. It's time to dress for dinner. I got lost in this. Yes? Telegram, sir. For Mrs Bligh. Were you expecting something? No. They're not all bad. Open it, please. I'll take it. What is it? James? It is bad news, isn't it? No. It's... it's marvellous. It's William. He's engaged. To whom? It doesn't say. Um, details to follow. I should dress. Do I really have to go? You most certainly do. Our guests would be insulted. Andrew won't care. It's true. And with his mother around, it's not as if I'm needed to keep the conversation going. That's enough. My apologies. I couldn't find my prayer book. Oh. A gift from my grandmother. Printed in 1842. Among my most cherished possessions. Seem to have left mine at home. Oh, where's, um... Ah. Olivia sends her apologies. She's feeling off colour. All the excitement, I expect. Last night's news. Perhaps I should stay and keep her company. I'm sure that won't be necessary. You'll be returning for lunch, won't you, before you go home? I believe that's the plan. I'll see you back here, then. Anna. Oh, settle, Grandmother. Anna. Enjoy the service. Livy! James said that you weren't feeling well. I lied. Oh. Well, if you need anything... I'll call Amy. I'll be fine. Really. Thank you. I thought I might find you here. What happened? It's nothing. I was being stupid. Just fooling around. No, I'm the one who's been stupid. I'm so... It's you that I want. I do want you. I'm off to get my dose of religion. You could do with it. When I lost my boys... at first, I couldn't forgive the bastards that done for them and I wanted to get over there and kill every one of them with me bare hands. But at the end of the day, something didn't sit right about me being here and them not and it was myself I had to forgive. There's no shame in survival, lass. Right. Well, it's been a while, so I better not keep God waiting. Roy... My aunt gave me a, um... a welcome mat to put out when I found a place to call home. If you wouldn't mind... I'd be honoured. I'd be honoured to wipe my boots on it. # Amazing Grace # How sweet the sound # That saved a wretch like me # I once was lost # But now I'm found # Was blind, but now I see # Amazing Grace # How sweet the sound
