 It's for you. Some woman. She wouldn't give her name. H-hello? Jack, it's brandy at the club. I'm sorry to call you like this, But t.J. Is here, and he's talking crazy. All right, I'll be right there. It's a work thing. ♪ Hey, there. Welcome to pinter's. I'm looking for brandy. Thanks. We're just passing through. ♪ Ready to fall Mr. Karsten. Brandy? Yeah. Where is he? ♪ Think I'm ready to lose it all ♪ ♪ keep me running, you keep me running ♪ Gentlemen... We're gonna need this room. Why did you call them?! I didn't want you to do that! He's not allowed to drink. I thought everyone here understood that. He shouldn't mix alcohol with his meds. I'm not sick! I'm fine. The police want to question you about your uncle's murder. You're obviously in no shape for that. Am I in trouble? But you need to sleep this off and get your head straight. We need to get you ready for their questions Before they bring you in. We'll put you up in a hotel. No. I'm not going into a hotel. T.J. I won't! He can come to my place. I don't think that's such a good idea. You can trust me, mr. Karsten. You know, it may be safer. It's more off the radar. Okay. All right. Just between us, okay? Come on, t.J. Let's go. ♪ Keep me running, you keep me running ♪ We're gonna need a criminal lawyer, jack. Well, not yet. Let's keep this low profile for now. Bunch of people sniffing around karsten allied. They find out about the missing money, It's gonna look like a motive... Enough to make them think T.J. Might actually have killed lou. It won't come to that, all right? I-I've got a guy. I'll talk to him and see what the police have got. This needs your focus, jack... All of it. Thanks for putting her to bed, marie. Have a good night. Your place is very clean. Oh. I-I got you a present last week at navy pier. They had this... Shooting game, And I-I-I won. What's going on, t.J.? You could tell me anything, you know? It's a bunny. It... it reminded me of you. Probably 'cause I'm thinking about you all the time. Oh. I can just see it, Living here with you guys... A happy little family. You have a family. Not like this. Jack. Orestes. Sorry to get you up so early. You been busy, huh? You got anything for me? Bunch of rambling messages t.J. Left on the dead guy's phone. Possible eyewitness on the scene... some valet, Maybe an I.D. Of the kid's car driving away, But no murder weapon. No d.N.A. All right, what about, uh, connie mrozek, lou's widow? It's a dead end. She gave 'em nothin'. Now, it's not enough for an arrest, but... This prosecutor's a hotshot with a thing for karsten. His name's drew stafford. Don't know him. Smart, young, Good-lookin', the kind of guy that makes it easy to hate him. He's out to make a name for himself. Thanks. You ain't gotta do all that. I'm already on the payroll. A little extra. That police pension's skimpy. Yeah. Morning. Where were you? Wait. Don't tell me. A karsten crisis that I really don't want to know about. Well, if you ever change your mind about that, Just say the word. Well, I promise you, The day you stop working for my dad, I'm gonna greet you at the door with a martini And ask you all about your day. Val: Where is my phone?! I honestly have no idea. No, where is it? I don't know. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Slow down. He took it to look at pictures of my friend jess Hey, no, no, no. And now he says that he forgot where he left it. Not a crisis, val. Call the phone. It'll turn up. Vic, I'm pretty sure jess is not into guys who steal phones. And why are you both not in school? We're helping mom set up her restaurant When I told you that I needed your help, I actually meant that, So you need to go upstairs right now and get dressed. When did this happen? You mean when did we become the parents of teenagers? I have no idea. They're like wild gorillas. With cellphones. Are we up for this? I think so. Mmm. Wait. The kids are upstairs. Yeah, but... The kids... Are 16, So they're either on the phone. They're on the computer... So they really don't care about boring... Old... Us. ♪ Do you remember this song? This... this was the summer that we got married. At the cabin? ♪ Hey, I... shh, shh, shh. So let's just be 16 for a minute. Let's just be completely oblivious To everything except right here And right now. ♪ Chained ♪ we're chained ♪ we're chained ♪ we're chained ♪ chained ♪ we're chained ♪ chained ♪ we're chained ♪ chained ♪ we're chained ♪ chained ♪ we're chained ♪ chained ♪ we're chained ♪ chained ♪ we're chained Look. Woman: Morning, sara. Hey. Did you bring something for the bake sale? Oh, I completely meant to, but I forgot... my mom doesn't bake. Not a lot. Cake mixes are totally fair game. To grind your own wheat or anything. Although I did try that once. I made some amazing pancakes. Okay, well, see you after school, monkey. Love you all the way to mars. Jupiter. Saturn. And I won't leave until... I know. Okay. Hey, kate. Yeah? Are you running the fund-raiser auction? Yeah. Bethany weber Was in charge of the auction, but, um, She's going through hell... With the divorce and everything. Oh, wow. Um, well, I'd like to help. I want to get more involved with the school. I was thinking that I could donate A family portrait session or something. Oh, wow. Wow. People will go crazy for that. Okay, great. Oliver: Mom! Okay. Um... I'll, uh, I'll... I'll try and do some baking later on. It can't be that hard, right? I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's be real. You've got no murder weapon. No one can I.D. T.J. Karsten at the scene. Who saw a guy with brown hair 200 feet away. It's not enough. Look, I went back over the widow's statement. There's more there. She's holding out on us. Drew, listen. Karsten and his cash built half this city. Don't make an enemy that you can't handle. I just... Crap! Look, for 30 years, this guy has spooked The entire state's attorney's office Into turning a blind eye, But he's not a king. He's a dinosaur. He doesn't scare me. He's a t. Rex, All that's driving this thing is some rabid prosecutor. If t.J. Can hold up on the questioning, We should be okay. That's quite an "if." Look, if all else fails, We can always bring up t.J.'s... Cognitive deficit. That's irrelevant. There is no deficit. Hi, jack. You went to the club that night. No, I told you. I-I went... T-to see lou. But if anyone asks, you went to the club. You were with brandy. That's what I say? Yes, t.J., that's what we all say. Okay? Yeah. All right, so the night lou died, Where were you? I was at the club. Are you telling the truth? Yes. Tell me the truth. Where were you? I went to the restaurant to see lou. No, t.J., the club. The club! But he said... where were you?! I... Went to fix things. It's useless. I don't understand. You asked me... L-listen, babe. You were with me... All night at the club. You found out about lou when you went home. And whatever anyone says, That's what you tell them. Hmm? That's the new truth. Keep it down. My daughter's sleeping. Sorry. So, did you see lou the night he died? I was at the club. What time did you leave the club? I was at the club. Did someone tell you to tell me that? I was at the club. This isn't gonna work. We have to keep trying. Sometimes I think we underestimate him. Okay. So... He stays here for the time being, Hidden from the cops. There's someone I want to talk to. I'll do some more digging. Drew: Hey, you. What's going on? Nothing. I just wanted to say hi. What are you up to? I'm, um, baking. Ah, well, will you get me Some beef jerky and toothpaste while you're there? What are you talking about? I'm covered in flour. Also, could you get some of those stain-remover... Wipe things? Spilled espresso all over my shirt. I'm hanging up now. Me, too. Probably won't be home till late. Bye. Drew: We as a society came up with a set of mandates That declare we respect the rights of others. It's a common contract that precludes us From just killing each other, like wild animals. So here's the thing. A man was murdered, And whoever committed that crime broke that sacred contract. So you'll have to forgive me for not worrying About inconveniencing your client. Well, I'm simply suggesting you broaden your investigation To other potential suspects. T.J. Karsten has absolutely no motive And a rock-solid alibi. Then why not present him for questioning? Look, you seem like an ambitious guy. Did you know that in the last 30 years, There hasn't been a mayor elected in this city Without thatcher karsten's support? What's your point? My point is... Hey. Sorry to interrupt. Hey, babe! What a surprise. I wanted to bring you a clean shirt... Drew: Thanks. Meet my beautiful, unpredictable wife sara. Hi. Nice to meet you. Uh, I-I should... Let you get back to it. Bye, babe. Where were we? Oh, I know! We were at the point where you insinuate... Some kind of political favor If I go easy on the karsten kid. Uh, I'm sorry. You know, I've... I've, uh, I've got another meeting, but thank you for your time. Thank you, jack. Sara. What the hell is going on? Hey, sara. Hey. Your husband's a slave driver. Yeah, I know. This is insane. I know. I can't believe... What was this? Was everything Some twisted kind of legal strategy? What are you talking about? Listen to me. Let go. I promise you, I had no idea... look, I don't... I don't know who you are Or why you'd do such a horrible thing. This is over. You understand? Never happened. We're done. Michael. Yeah, I hear you. I hear what you're saying. I don't care what corporate is saying. I am not running an ad With a 9-year-old girl in a corset. It's gross, and as a parent, I simply won't sign off on it. Fine. You will. Uh, bye. "as a parent"? Sometimes an almost-dead plant counts as a child. I'm trolling for an assignment. Well, I don't think we have anything up your alley. Just a... Piece on three days in chicago With photos in millennium park. I'll take it. Sara, I know you. When you are jumping at the chance To shoot dogs in sweaters at millennium park, Something's wrong. I'm good, thanks. I don't know. I'm just... I'm feeling like I need to... Well, sounds like you might be doing a little too much yoga. I just... Want to be... I want to be better. I wanna be better... Better at work, Better as a mom, better as a wife. Honey, who doesn't want to be better? You want a real existential crisis? Try going to the weddings of three different ex-boyfriends In a 6-month time span. Now, that is a hot mess. Take the quiche around while it's hot, And then come back for the prosciutto, okay? Just take... Thatcher: Lou always used to say to me, "everything essential is invisible." Ah. That's a quote from a book He used to read to the kids. Really? But it's true, isn't it? Love, trust, Loyalty... They're all invisible, And also the most important things in life. I put another $50,000 In your granddaughter's college fund. I wish you wouldn't do that. Connie, you're family. It's the least I can do. Please don't. There's no need. Uh, I need a minute. It's about t.J. I'll be right back. What's going on? He just called from the police station. Vic: I'll take one. What do you think you're doing? I'm participating in a sacred polish death ritual. Don't even think about it. Connie. Did you see these amazing flowers? They came this morning. My, who from? Frank perkins. Lou's partner? Is he here? No. He's in hong kong on business. He... Sends his regrets. May I? Where's jack going? Work. Yeah. What else is new? Well, is t.J. Coming? No. He's still too upset. So you let him stay home, play video games all day? I didn't let him do anything, elaine. He chose not to come. He was afraid he couldn't keep it together. You treat him like a child, dad, And that's why he behaves that way. You always were quick to judge, But then you're not the one who has to live with him, To take care of him, To fix things when he screws up, ever since... Since what? Since the accident? You can't even say it. Listen, you call it taking care of him, And I call it stunting him forever. Look, trust me. He could not be here for any number of reasons. Just... Leave it at that. If something is going on with him, I deserve to know about it. Hey, jack. Hey, thanks. See you at the game. Are you under arrest? No, he's not. What the hell's going on here? Mitchell: While monitoring the residence, We came across mr. Karsten Is that so? Well, he declines to answer any questions At this time. Actually, he doesn't. It's okay, jack. No, no, no. It's not okay. I'm not gonna let you talk to these guys. I-I want to help them find out who killed uncle lou. I can do it. I'm just gonna do what I always do and tell the truth. Okay, great. Perfect. A bit higher, billy. Yeah, great. Was there any problem between uncle lou And your family? I was at the club. Is he not right? Is there something off about him? He's not your guy. You should broaden your investigation. And did your father have any kind of beef... With your uncle lou? Lou was family. We all love each other. Elaine: Why would the police be looking at him? Why would you think, elaine? He's my son. It's me they're after. Drew: The night lou died, what were you doing? I was at the club. Is that the truth, t.J.? Ask brandy. Did somebody coach you? Did they tell you what to say? No. I was at the club. I can check to see if you were at the club. I can get closed-circuit tv from pinter's, Eyewitness reports, guest lists. I can find out if you're lying to me. Do you know what happens if you lie? Your nose gets long. It's a crime, t.J. You can go to jail. Well... Well... I don't want to lie to you, then. That's right. You don't want to lie to us. So Let's start over, okay? Okay. Thatcher: Connie? Are you leaving? This was lovely, but I'm tired. Of course you are. You've been through hell. I kept quiet about t.J., But they're gonna come back to me. I'm sure they will. And when they do, I need you to do something for me. Maybe you could remember something new. You want me to risk everything I have To protect your son, who might have killed... Connie. For 25 years, I carried lou And your family, Despite the fact that he was a bumbling incompetent Who was also probably stealing from me. So... I want to make this perfectly clear. Everything you have, I gave you. And it can go away... Just like that. I saw lou at the office, And then I called him a few times on the phone. And you were angry. No. Not angry. No, no, I just... I wanted to, you know, fix things. Is that what you did, t.J.? Did you fix things? Did you go to see your uncle lou? Yes. I-I did. I did see him. Okay, so you're admitting that you did see your uncle. Yes. Yes... I saw... A picture of him on the tv On the news after my dad told me what happened, After I got back from the club, Where I had been all night with brandy. If you don't believe me, you can ask her. All right. Well done. He should get an oscar. Why don't you focus on a legitimate suspect Instead of continuing to harass my family? I've read up on you. Parents came over from ireland, right? Died when you were little. Construction accident... On a karsten site, no less. And then, lo and behold, The little immigrant orphan boy Gets adopted into a mighty chicago clan. What a lucky guy. Well, my family is committed to finding The real killer of lou mrozek in any way we can, So you call me, counselor. You know... To wonder... Is this the life that your parents imagined for you... Their only son growing up to be an errand boy For thatcher karsten, A bagman for a gang of crooks? When you were a kid, jack, Is this the life you dreamed of? You need to leave. You can't be here. I'm sorry. I know this is awkward. How did you even find me? I called the magazine office. They said you were on assignment here. Hasn't any of this hit you yet? You were at my husband's office this morning. I'm working, jack. I'm trying to work. Five minutes. Just so I can explain. We owe each other that. Just not here, okay? Yeah. Um, hello. Can I help you? You drew stafford? Yeah. Who are you? Serena sanguillen, fbi. I've been running point on a federal investigation To thatcher karsten. Wow. We should... Definitely get to know each other, then. Please, have a seat. I promise you, until today, I-I never knew who your husband was Or that I'd ever have any legal matter with him. "legal matter"? It's a murder trial. It's got nothing to do with us. It has everything to do with us... Who you are versus... What happened was a mistake, and I'll never forgive myself For getting lost in some stupid schoolgirl fantasy. It isn't like that. It's not some... Why should I believe anything you say? You fix things. You maneuver situations. You manipulate people. You're a professional liar. Apparently, a very good one. Yeah, I am. Except when I'm with you. Elaine: I'll get it. Can I help you? Hello. I'm a.S.A. Drew stafford. I was hoping to speak with constance mrozek. It's been a long day, And my aunt is exhausted. She's already told the police everything she knows. For over three hours? But they got absolutely nothing. I think this family's been through enough. Honey... The last thing that we need And drag my aunt through this all over again. Could you excuse us, please? It's okay. Okay. I'll call you later. Okay. My brother didn't hurt anybody. He's not capable of that. She's protective. I understand. You're family. You'd do anything for each other, right? Is there something you want from me? Thatcher karsten thought your husband Was stealing from him. He wasn't. Lou mrozek was the most honorable man I've ever known. And yet after 27 years of honesty, Hard work, and commitment, Karsten had no problem believing Embezzled a million dollars from the company. That's why lou did the right thing And he went to the feds, and that's why karsten Sent t.J. To take care of him. No, t.J. Would never... T.J. Is being raised Under the iron fist of a tyrant. He didn't have a choice. Mrs. Mrozek, I know where you come from, I'd never ask you to betray that code, But you need to ask yourself this... Who, if not you, Will be loyal to your husband? Do this for him. Tell me the truth about that night. I come here whenever life gets a little crazy. Sit at a bench and look out at the river. Searching for buried treasure. I should really get back. Look, I know you're trying to get me out of your head. That's what I've been doing, too. But I can't. Yeah, it's messy and complicated and risky, But... We can't pretend that it didn't happen Or that it doesn't change everything. There are things that I could say right now, Things I wish I could say, But talking won't help. Just make things more confusing. I'm not confused. How can you say that? You're not making any sense. I do make sense. This... This is real. My next setup is ready. Well, come back after. I-I-I'll wait. I can't. Look... Meet me just one more time. We'll figure out what this is. If you don't come, I will never bother you again, I swear. Tonight, 8:00, here. The trip to dune acres was fruitful. I saw the proofs. The sushi pictures look gorgeous. Oh, thank you. I, uh, I ran into someone there... Someone I just met. What a coincidence. Was it? What exactly is a coincidence? Okay, are we gonna need a bong? I mean, if two years ago, I hadn't gone to the ruscha exhibit On that exact day at that exact time, Gone to lunch first or the el had broken down, Then I would never have met you And never gotten this job And never be sitting here right now. So a random meeting has had this huge impact On my life. Was that just a coincidence? It scares me. How do you know if you're living the life You're supposed to live or... The one that just... Happened to you? You think if you were an hour later at the museum And that we never met, That you'd end up like a truck driver Instead of a photographer? I don't believe that we are victims of fate. We shape our own lives. So... The path we're on Is the path that we want to be on, The one that we're meant to be on. Yeah. Except when a bear is chasing you. Then you get the hell out of the way. Get enough to eat? Oh. That t-bone was like something Out of "the flintstones." I'm very proud of you, son. Maybe I haven't given you enough responsibility. I'm gonna fix that. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Yeah, I would. Okay. T.J.? T.J. Karsten, you're under arrest. T.J.! Don't run! Unh! Aah! Unh! I need backup at hubbard and wells. Suspect in custody.
