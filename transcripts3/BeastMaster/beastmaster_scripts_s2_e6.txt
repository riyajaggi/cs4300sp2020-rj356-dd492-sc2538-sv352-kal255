  WATCH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I WANT IT ALL IN ONE PIECE. THERE'S NO HARM DONE --  IT'D TAKE A BATTERING RAM  TO CRACK THIS OPEN. OR ONE KNOCK  FROM YOUR HARD HEAD. BUILD A NEW ONE BY FIRST LIGHT. REMEMBER YOUR PLACE, TRACKER. LESSER TRIBES DON'T  COMMAND NORD WARRIORS. VODEN ORDERED EVERY TIGER  IN THIS FOREST CAPTURED. OUT OF MY WAY. YOU THINK KING VODEN  CAN'T DO WITHOUT YOU.

 BUT WE CONQUERED  THE WORLD FOR HIM. DON'T INSULT THOSE WHO  ARE BETTER THAN YOU ARE. BETTER? AT WHAT? ARINA? IS THERE A PROBLEM? THE CAGES NEED TO BE STRONG. THE TIGERS THIS BEASTMASTER COMMANDS WILL EXPLOIT ANY WEAKNESS AND TEAR  THEIR CAPTORS TO PIECES. CREATURES AFTER MY OWN HEART. PERHAPS THEIR FIRE WILL HELP ME UNDERSTAND  THE ONE BURNING IN YOU. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT FADE ONCE  WE'D CRUSHED THE TERRONS AFTER THEY SAVAGELY DESTROYED  YOUR NAMIB HOMELAND.

 BUT IT FLARES EVEN HOTTER NOW. I'M JUST FOLLOWING  YOUR ORDERS. YES, FATE MAKES  SLAVES OF US ALL. FATE...AND THE WILL  OF THE MIGHTY. BUT EMBRACING ONE'S DESTINY  ALSO BRINGS GREAT REWARDS. WILL THIS BEASTMASTER UNDERSTAND THIS? HE'S NOT LIKE OTHER MEN. BUT STILL A MAN,  AND ALL MEN HAVE A PRICE. ONCE HIS BEASTS ARE MINE,  HE WILL SERVE ME. HE DOESN'T LIKE ANIMALS IN CAGES. YOU RUN THE RISK OF MAKING HIM  A DANGEROUS ADVERSARY. BUT ONE WHO  FIGHTS FAIRLY, ARINA, AND THAT'S WHAT  GIVES ME THE ADVANTAGE. IN A FEW SHORT DAYS,  THE BEASTMASTER WILL BE MINE. DAR! DO YOU SEE ANYTHING? SHOULD WE BE MOVING, OR...  SHOULD I COME UP THERE... OR WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? THERE'S PROBABLY AN EASIER  WAY TO COME AND TELL ME. I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT. [ GROWLING ] WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW.  HE SAID HE'D TELL US LATER. -DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?  -SOME PEOPLE CAMPING IN THE NO, WHOEVER IT IS,  ISN'T AFRAID OF BEING FOUND. PRIESTS... THEY WON'T BE SATISFIED  UNTIL THEY KILL US ALL. I'VE NEVER KNOWN  ANGER LIKE THIS. WHEN I WAS UNDER  THE CUTTING STONE, ALL OF MY FEAR  TURNED TO HATRED. A MAN WHO CONFRONTS HIS ENEMY  IN ANGER IS ALREADY DEFEATED. I DON'T FORGET ANYTHING.  I KNOW THAT. I ALSO KNOW THAT FEAR  MAKES YOU WEAK. YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT EVIL,  NOT RUN FROM IT. I'M NOT GOING TO REST UNTIL I DRIVE THOSE PRIESTS  OUT OF XINCA. TAO, YOU'RE ONE MAN, AND YOUR  PEOPLE AREN'T A WARRIOR RACE. YOU COULD HELP. YOU COULD SEND IN RUH AND  SHARAK. SEND IN 100 TIGERS. ANIMALS KILL FOR FOOD,  AND THEY'RE NOT WARRIORS EITHER. WHEN I LEFT MY HOME... MY SOLE PURPOSE WAS TO SPREAD  THE KNOWLEDGE OF XINCA AND FIND MORE TO BRING BACK. AND NOW, IT'S JUST... EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. IF YOU'RE MEANT TO,  YOU'LL FIND A NEW PURPOSE. -WHAT DOES HE SEE?  -SOME MEN HAVE  TRAPPED A TIGER. -RUH?  -NO. LOOK AT THIS TROPHY. VODEN WILL BE PLEASED. PUT YOUR ROPES AROUND ITS NECK.  CHOKE THE FIGHT OUT OF IT. HERE, CATCH! I'M SURPRISED SHE DOESN'T  TRY TO JUMP ON HIM. [ WHISTLING ]  YOU BETTER  WATCH YOURSELF. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... WHO ELSE WOULD RISK  HIS LIFE FOR AN ANIMAL? I WOULDN'T DO THAT  IF I WERE YOU. HE'S THE BEASTMASTER,  THIS FOREST'S FULL OF ANIMALS THAT  WON'T LET YOU DO THIS. WHAT BUSINESS  IS THAT OF YOURS? WELL, HE'S A FRIEND, AND  I'M A SEEKER OF THE TRUTH. AND THE TRUTH IS,  THAT TIGER THERE AND TIGERS GET VERY UNREASONABLE WHEN YOU HARM ONE OF THEIR OWN. SHUT THE FOOL'S MOUTH. [ SCREAMING ] -RUH'S HURT.  -I'LL GET MY HERBS. DAR, I'VE, UH, APPLIED SOME HEALING HERBS,  BUT HE SHOULDN'T WALK ON THE LEG. WHAT'S GOING ON? -IT'S RUH'S MOTHER.  -MOTHER? TIALA.  WHAT'S SHE DOING  SO FAR AWAY -FROM THE MYDLANDS? -SHE'S LOOKING FOR THE ARCHWAY. THE ARCHWAY OF THE SPIRITS,  WHERE TIGERS GO TO DIE. -WELL, MAYBE I, I  HAVE SOME HERBS--  -NO... NO, IT'S HER TIME. DUTY AS A SON TO TAKE HER,  BUT NOW THAT HE'S HURT, -HE'S ASKED ME TO DO IT.  -UH... WHERE IS THIS PLACE? WHERE ARE WE NOW? HERE. IT'S THERE. THAT'S NEAR XINCA.  WE CAN'T GO BACK THERE. WE'RE NOT READY.  WE HAVEN'T GOT A PLAN. YOU DON'T HAVE  TO COME WITH US. UH, NO... YOU ONCE TOLD ME THAT EVERYTHING  HAPPENS FOR A REASON. RUH'S ABOUT TO LOSE  HIS FAMILY; I'VE LOST MINE. MAYBE I'M SUPPOSED TO DO THIS. TAO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.  I CAN DO THIS BY MYSELF. YOU MIGHT NEED MY HELP. I WAS VERY HANDY  TODAY -- SCARED... BUT HANDY. BESIDES, YOU WON'T  BE MUCH USE TO YOUR ANIMALS IF YOU GET  CAUGHT BY BLOOD PRIESTS OR -MORE WARRIORS LIKE THOSE.  -YOU TWO... COVER RUH'S TRACKS.  THOSE WARRIORS MIGHT RETURN. OH... AND MAKE SURE HE  STAYS OFF THAT LEG. YOU HAD THE BEASTMASTER IN YOUR  GRASP, AND YOU LET HIM GO. I FIND FAILURE FASCINATING. DOES A MAN FAIL  BECAUSE HE'S OUTMATCHED, OR SIMPLY BECAUSE HE CAN'T FIND THE CHARACTER  TO OVERCOME HIS ENEMIES? HE SENT EAGLES AT US, AND TIGERS. BEASTS HE SHOULD COMMAND FOR ME. THIS SERPENT COULD  BE SLAIN WITH ONE BLOW. BUT THE BEASTMASTER COULD MAKE IT A WEAPON  THAT WOULD DESTROY YOU. WHY, YOKEN? IS IT HIS STRENGTH  THAT TRIUMPHS, OR IS IT YOUR OWN WEAKNESS? BECAUSE A KING  HAS TO KNOW THESE THINGS. I'M ONLY AS STRONG  AS MY WEAKEST MAN... FOR THE WEAK GIVE  HOPE TO MY ENEMIES. I WOULD WALK THROUGH FIRE FOR YOU, MY KING, YOU KNOW THAT. WOULD YOU? WELL, LET'S NOT  GET TOO DRAMATIC. IT'S A SMALL TENT. IT COULD GO UP IN NO TIME. COME. BARE YOUR SHIELD ARM. PROVE TO YOUR KING THAT YOU ARE WORTHY. A WALL OF ICE GRINDS INTO OUR KINGDOM... I FIND NEW TERRITORIES FOR YOU. ARMIES OUTNUMBER US... I CREATE WEAPONS  TO ANNIHILATE THEM. THERE IS NOTHING I CANNOT OVERCOME. I WILL NOT BE DENIED  THE BEASTMASTER. FOR HE WILL BRING US BATTALIONS OF TIGERS, SQUADRONS OF EAGLES, TROOPS OF ELEPHANTS TO STRIKE FEAR INTO THOSE  THAT STAND AGAINST US. THEY WILL CONQUER ALL AND LEAVE ME AN UNSCARRED ARMY  TO RULE THE WORLD. AHH! I THINK WE'LL NEED  YOUR FIRE FOR THIS MISSION. BRING BACK  THE BEASTMASTER ALIVE. TAKE THIS ONE AND TEACH HIM  WHAT OBEDIENCE MEANS. WHAT HAPPENS TO A TIGER  WHEN IT REACHES THIS ARCHWAY? A GHOST OF  THEIR ANCESTORS ESCORTS THEM TO  THE FORESTS BEYOND. THE FORESTS BEYOND? YOU SEE, EVERY TIGER HAS TO  MAKE THE PASSAGE TO ENSURE -THAT THEIR KIND LIVES ON.  -DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? WHAT I BELIEVE DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVE. IT'S A PILGRIMAGE... LIKE THE ONE THAT HOLY MEN  MAKE TO THEIR SHRINES. THE JOURNEY  SIGNIFIES THEIR FAITH. IS THAT ALL SHE HAS TO DO?  JUST GET THERE? SHE MUST CROSS A RIVER TO GIVE  THANKS FOR THE WATER THAT TO CLIMB A MOUNTAIN TO HONOUR THE GROUND ON WHICH SHE HUNTED. AND FINALLY, SHE MUST SPEND HER LAST NIGHT SHELTERED  ONLY BY THE STARS. SEE, THAT WAY SHE WILL ACCEPT HER SMALL PLACE  IN THIS UNIVERSE. FORDING A RIVER,  CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN? SHE'S ILL, DAR,  SHE'LL NEVER MAKE IT. SHE HAS TO. WHERE ARE THEY HEADED? ARE THE TIGERS WITH HIM? ONE OF THEM...BUT THIS ISN'T THE ONE HE CALLS HIS FRIEND. IT'S OLD. THE PRINTS ARE UNEVEN. AS IF EVERY STEP IS PAINFUL. GOOD...WE'LL BE ON THEM SOON. AND THIS WOUND CAN BE AVENGED. DO I NEED TO  REMIND YOU THAT WE ARE TO TAKE THE  BEASTMASTER ALIVE? I CAN STILL BATHE THIS WOUND IN THE BLOOD OF HIS  MOUTHY LITTLE FRIEND. THAT'LL TAKE OUT  SOME OF THE STING. NOT HAVING TO FOLLOW YOU AROUND  WILL TAKE OUT THE REST. VODEN WANTS THE  BEASTMASTER ALIVE. DON'T OVERESTIMATE  YOUR VALUE, TRACKER, HE'LL USE YOU AND DISCARD YOU LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE OWNS. SHE THANKS YOU. HER BONES ARE OLD. IT'S HARD FOR HER  TO BEND DOWN TO THE RIVER. WE'LL CROSS WHEN SHE'S RESTED. THOSE MEN  YOU FOUGHT, WHERE'D THEY  COME FROM? SAME LAND AS ARINA, I THINK. THEY HAD THE SAME WEAPONS. -WHY ARE THEY HERE?  -I DON'T KNOW. BUT THEY WENT TO A LOT  OF TROUBLE TO TRAP A TIGER. AFTER THIS IS OVER,  WE'LL RETURN, FIND OUT. GREAT...IF WE DON'T RUN INTO  BLOOD PRIESTS OR GHOST TIGERS, WE HAVE WELL-ARMED  KILLERS WAITING FOR US. HOW FAR AWAY  IS THE ARCHWAY? A DAY, MAYBE TWO. IT'S UP TO HER. SHE'S GROWING WEAKER. THEY KNOW WHEN IT'S  THEIR TIME, DON'T THEY? WHY DON'T WE? MAYBE WE DO,  BUT WE JUST... DON'T ADMIT IT. HAVE YOU EVER SENSED DEATH? DID YOU SENSE IT COMING  FOR YOUR TRIBE, KYRA? IF I HAD, I WOULD  HAVE DONE SOMETHING. REALLY? IT'S TAKEN YOU  THIS LONG TO TELL ME. NO, OH, IT NEVER CAME UP. -WHAT'S HIS NAME?  -KIM. HE LEFT XINCA A YEAR  BEFORE I BEGAN MY QUEST. WISH I KNEW WHERE HE WAS. IS HE A THINKER,  LIKE YOU? NO, HA, HA, HE'S MORE LIKE YOU. STRONG-WILLED AND SINGLE-MINDED. HE WOULD HAVE TOLD THOSE PRIESTS TO... TAO, WHATEVER HAPPENS-- HAPPENS FOR A REASON -- I KNOW. GOOD. SHE SAID THAT "HUMANS SPEND  TOO MUCH TIME TALKING," "AND NOT ENOUGH TIME KNOWING." [ LAUGHING ] LET'S GO. ARINA'S TRACKING US  WITH A WARRIOR. TIALA'S TOO WEAK TO FIGHT. IT'S THIS WAY.  WHERE WE GOING? WITH ANY LUCK  THEY'LL THINK WE CROSSED. THESE ARE FRESH. THEY'RE CLOSE. THEY CROSSED HERE. LET'S GO. ONCE AGAIN, I OWE YOU MY LIFE. WHY ARE YOU  SO CLOSE TO XINCA? DON'T YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS IT'S BECOME? DANGER ISN'T HIGH ON DAR'S  LIST OF CONCERNS RIGHT NOW. SHH...COME ON.  STAY LOW. I'M GOING  TO GET TIALA OUT OF HERE  BEFORE THEY RETURN. SO, WHY WERE YOU  NEAR THE RIVER? I'M CAMPED NEARBY.  WE MUST MOVE QUICKLY. THIS PLACE IS  CRAWLING WITH PRIESTS. CRAWLING? IT'S EIRONS WHO CRAWL -- LIKE THE VERMIN THEY ARE. SEIZE THEM! -WE MUST HELP HIM.  -IT'S 3 TO 1, IT'S ABOUT EVEN. LIKE I SAID -- ABOUT EVEN. LET'S GO. TIALA'S GOT A RIVER TO CROSS. IF YOU'VE LOST -THE TRAIL...  -I HAVEN'T LOST IT. WE'VE BEEN ALL OVER THIS BANK. THERE'S NO SIGN THEY  LEFT THE WATER. AND WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? THEY COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN  WE WERE BEHIND THEM. HE HAS OTHER WAYS THE SUN'S SETTING. WE'LL NEVER  FIND THE TRAIL AFTER DARK. IF YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING,  WE WOULD'VE HAD THEM. MAKE CAMP. WE'LL PICK UP  THE TRAIL IN THE MORNING. WHY DOES VODEN LET  YOU GET AWAY WITH SO MUCH? BECAUSE I'VE NEVER  DISAPPOINTED HIM. ONE DAY, YOU WILL. ONE DAY, HE'LL REALIZE THAT FALLEN TRIBES  LIKE YOURS WERE DEFEATED BECAUSE YOU WERE  INFERIOR PEOPLE. THEN HE'LL REALIZE WHAT YOU REALLY ARE -- ANOTHER BEAST HE CAN USE  TO HIS PURPOSE. WHAT'S SHE DOING? ASKING FOR A SIGN  THAT SHE CAN CONTINUE THE JOURNEY. IS SOMETHING HAPPENING? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN? DID YOU SEE SOMETHING? NO...BUT SHE DID. THE WARRIORS CALL THEMSELVES NORDS. EVEN THE PRIESTS KNEW BETTER  THAN TO RESIST THEIR BOY KING. BOY KING? HE'S VERY YOUNG TO WEAR  A CROWN, BUT VERY DANGEROUS. -WHERE ARE THEY FROM?  -THE FAR UPLANDS. AND THEIR WEAPONS? MADE FROM ELEMENTS THEY MELT. THEY BOAST OF WIPING OUT  THE TERRONS IN ONE NIGHT. YOU MEAN ZAD'S DEAD? SOME SAY HE FLED  TO THE MOUNTAINS, OR HIDES WITH A SORCERESS. HOW DO YOU  KNOW ALL THIS? THOSE OF US HIDING,  SHARE WHAT WE HEAR. YOU'VE FOUND  OTHER EIRONS? WHO? WHEN XINCA BROKE APART,  THE ELDERS ARRANGED SECRET PLACES TO LEAVE MESSAGES. WELL, DO ANY  OF THEM MENTION WE DON'T USE NAMES IN OUR  MESSAGES. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. YOUR FAMILY, THEY COULD BE IN THE FOREST, BUT... WHERE ARE YOU GOING? MAKING SURE WE'RE SAFE.  DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. REST. WE'LL LEAVE  AT FIRST LIGHT. SHH... HA, I SEEM TO REMEMBER BEING  IN THIS POSITION ONCE BEFORE. JUST CAN'T STOP  FOLLOWING ME, CAN YOU? I'M FOLLOWING YOU BECAUSE A  GREAT KING SEEKS YOUR COUNSEL. WHY? HE CAN EXPLAIN BETTER THAN I. AND HE MEANS YOU NO HARM. THEN WHY DOES  HE HUNT ME? HIS CAMP ISN'T FAR. ASK HIM. ARE YOU PLANNING ON STAYING  IN THAT POSITION ALL NIGHT? OH, THAT'S RIGHT, I FORGOT. YOU'RE THE ONE  WHO LIKES TO BE ON TOP. WHY ARE YOU HELPING THIS KING? BECAUSE IT SERVES MY PURPOSE. AND BECAUSE HE HELPED ME  DEFEAT MY ENEMIES. YOU WOULD BE WISE TO MEET HIM. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE  I HAVE TO DO FIRST. SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT  THAN THE WILL OF A KING? HE'S NOT MY KING. THE TIGER SLOWS YOU DOWN. SHE'S OLD AND TIRED. WE'LL CATCH YOU BEFORE  THE NEXT SUNDOWN. IF I AGREE TO SEE HIM? -WE CAN LEAVE TONIGHT.  -NO. I'LL GO WITH YOU --  BUT NOT UNTIL I GET THE TIGER WHERE SHE MUST GO. HOW DO I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU? YOU DON'T. BUT I'LL FIND YOU.  I ALWAYS DO. -IF YOU LET ME DOWN--  -I'D NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF. THERE MUST BE A WAY TO RETAKE  XINCA FROM THE PRIESTS. IF WE COULD DISCOVER  WHAT BROUGHT THEM-- WHAT BROUGHT THEM? YEAH, DID THEY COME TO TRADE? TAO, THE BLOOD PRIESTS ARE EIRONS. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S TRUE. AS XINCA GREW  WEALTHY, MANY TURNED TO  A THIRST FOR PLEASURE AND POWER. EVERYTHING BEGAN  TO FALL APART. THE PRIESTS PROMISED  A RETURN TO ORDER. AT FIRST, THEY KILLED ANYONE  WHO HAD BROKEN THEIR LAWS. BUT SOON THEY CAME AFTER ANYONE  WHO DID NOT SERVE THEM OR THEIR GOALS. THAT'S IMP...  IT CAN'T BE. EIRONS RESPECT LIFE. THEY DON'T TAKE IT. EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO FAST. NOBODY COULD STOP IT. THE CORRUPT QUICKLY  EMBRACED THE DARK SIDE. AND THE REST-- HIDE IN THE FOREST LIKE GHOSTS. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I GOT UP EARLY. HAD A LOOK AROUND ON MY OWN. YOU'VE BEEN GONE  A LONG TIME. I HAD A GOOD LOOK. THEY WENT THIS WAY. YOU'RE SURE THIS TIME? YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE  WHO CAN READ TRACKS, YOU KNOW. GOOD, MAYBE WE'LL  FIND HIM TODAY. ARE YOU SURE YOU  WANT TO FIND HIM? OR CAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO ANOTHER NIGHT SLEEPING  IN THE MUD? PUT ME IN CHARGE -- AND WE'LL SPEND A HUNDRED NIGHTS IN THE MUD IF THAT'S WHAT GIVES VODEN WHAT HE WANTS. I LEFT MY NAME  ON A MESSAGE TELLING THE EIRONS TO COME TOGETHER. AND THEN WHAT? WE'LL FIND EACH OTHER.  STOP BEING GHOSTS. CAN'T FIND YOUR FAMILY  IF YOU'RE HIDING FROM THEM. I'LL VISIT AS MANY PLACES  POSSIBLE TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE. IT WOULD BE SAFER  TO STAY WITH US. I'LL TRAVEL MORE QUICKLY ALONE. I'LL FIND YOU AGAIN. I PROMISE. LET'S FIND TIALA  HER MOUNTAIN. COME ON. YOU KNOW, DAR,  I'VE BEEN THINKING. I'LL TAKE THAT  AS A SIGN YOU'RE  FEELING BETTER. YES, I AM, NOW  THAT WE HAVE A PLAN. I'VE BEEN THINKING  ABOUT AN OLD SAYING. IT DOESN'T MATTER  IF A MAN FALLS, SO LONG AS HE  RISES AND GOES ON. I LIKE THAT. IT'S JUST LIKE TIALA,  IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH SHE HURTS  OR SHE STUMBLES, SHE GOES ON. SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW  IF SHE'LL MAKE HER GOAL. BY FOLLOWING IN HER  FOOTSTEPS, I KNOW I CAN RISE AGAIN,  AND SO WILL MY PEOPLE. JUST DON'T FALL HERE. THIS GROUND LOOKS  A LITTLE UNSTABLE. WE SHOULD LET TIALA REST UNTIL WE FIND A SAFER WAY DOWN. [ SCREAMING ] MAYBE I SHOULD FOLLOW YOU. MAYBE I SHOULD BE BEHIND  IN CASE YOU SLIP. BETTER PLAN. AHHH! DAR, I CAN'T HOLD ON. TRUST ME, IT'S  A BETTER CHOICE THAN LETTING GO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IF I CAN WEDGE MY STAFF  INTO THE ROCK, I CAN PULL US UP ONTO THE LEDGE. -GIVE ME YOUR HAND.  -WHAT? I CAN'T PUT MY STAFF  TOGETHER ONE-HANDED. -I CAN'T HOLD ON WITH ONE.  -WHY NOT GIVE UP, LET GO? COME ON, YOU CAN DO THIS. TAO, GIVE ME YOUR HAND. GIVE ME YOUR HAND. I GOT YOU! [ PANTING ] ALL RIGHT. THIS IS MY WIFE, ALAU.  WE FOUND YOUR MESSAGE SCROLL. WE HEARD THE ROCK  FALL AND SCREAMS. JUST A MOMENT. THANK YOU FOR HELPING US. WE SHOULDN'T  STAY HERE. OTHERS MAY HAVE HEARD  YOUR SCREAMS. COME, QUICKLY. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. THE BEASTMASTER WAS IN YOUR  GRASP, AND YOU LET HIM GO. YOU PLANNED  TO LEAD ME IN CIRCLES UNTIL YOU COULD CLAIM THE GLORY  OF HIS CAPTURE FOR YOURSELF. SANE ENOUGH TO KNOW  A TRAITOR WHEN I SEE ONE. BIND HER... AND PUT HER ON A LEASH. SO YOU CAN LEAD US  LIKE THE DOGS THAT TAUGHT HER TO TRACK. MY MOTHER USED TO MAKE THESE. HER NAME'S LANA,  WIFE OF SAN THE TEACHER. DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THEM? DON'T DESPAIR. THEY  MAY WELL BE SAFE. THERE ARE MANY IN HIDING. WE'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR  SOMEONE TO GIVE US HOPE THAT XINCA'S GREATNESS  COULD BE RESTORED. NO EIRON  IN XINCA HAD EVER STUDIED  THE ARTS OF WAR. WE WERE DEFENSELESS  WHEN THE PRIESTS ATTACKED. -I DON'T KNOW THE ARTS OF WAR.  -BUT YOUR SCROLL... I THOUGHT,  IF ENOUGH EIRONS COOPERATED LIKE THE COUNCILS DID,  A PLAN WOULD FOLLOW. HOW'S TIALA? SHE'S FADING FAST. WE'LL SLEEP UNDER THE STARS  TONIGHT. LEAVE AT DAWN. STAY IN THE FOREST.  SOMEONE WILL SEE YOU. I HAVE NO CHOICE. YOUR BEASTMASTER TRAVELS  WITH AN EIRON WHO PLOTS AN INSURRECTION. THIS ONE WAS HIS MESSENGER. WHEN YOUR WARRIORS CAPTURE  THE BEASTMASTER, WE WANT HIS FRIEND. DOES SHE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE? YOU'LL FIND EIRONS DON'T TALK UNTIL THE CUTTING STONE  IS AT THEIR HEARTS. LEAVE HER. SHE'LL TALK TO ME. BUT SHE'S TOMORROW'S SACRIFICE. IF I'VE FINISHED WITH HER  BY THEN, YOU CAN HAVE HER. NO ONE WILL FORCE YOU TO TALK. BUT YOU WILL TALK. I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED. AND I KNOW HOW MUCH IT HURTS. BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE UP NOW. WILL SHE MAKE IT? IF SHE SURVIVES  THROUGH THE NIGHT. YOU SEEM MORE CONCERNED  FOR HER THAN YOUR OWN FAMILY. I'D LIKE TO KNOW  ONE OF THEM HAS A FUTURE. WITH ALL THE DANGERS,  YOU'VE NEVER ONCE WAVERED FROM YOUR PROMISE TO RUH. A GRACE AND AN HONOUR  THAT NO OTHER HUMAN HAS. I'VE LEARNED A LOT  ON THIS JOURNEY. SIMPLY COMPLETE THE SENTENCE  AND YOUR TORMENT ENDS. THE BEASTMASTER TRAVELS TO... MARTYRS INTRIGUING -- THEY HOLD  A CAUSE SO DEAR THAT THEY DIE FOR IT, BUT IN DYING, THEY LOSE ANY CHANCE OF MAKING IT SUCCEED. I MIGHT WIN TONIGHT'S BATTLE  AND STILL LOSE THE WAR. BUT IF YOU SUCCEED, YOU DIE...AND NEVER  SAVOUR MY DEFEAT. SURELY YOU DON'T WANT YOUR LIFE  TO HAVE BEEN THAT POINTLESS. WE FOUND HIM. HE CAMPS WITH  A HELPLESS OLD TIGER. IF YOU HAD YOUR WAY, WE NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND  HIM SO VULNERABLE. TONIGHT I REGAIN MY PLACE  WITH VODEN, AND YOU DIE. YOU DON'T HAVE  A CHANCE, BEASTMASTER. -DO THE SMART THING.  -I AM.  -KILL IT! [ GROANING ] HAS SHE PASSED THE LAST TEST? SHE'S DONE WHAT WAS NEEDED. NOW, LET'S GET TO THE ARCHWAY. [ CAWING ] THERE'S MORE WARRIORS. -TAO, CARO'S WITH THEM.  -IS SHE ALL RIGHT? SHE SEEMS TO BE. THERE'S A MAN ON A WHITE HORSE. THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY. ARINA... I COULDN'T ASK YOU TO STALL HIM? HE'S SMARTER THAN THAT. ALL RIGHT, TAO,  GO AND HIDE YOUR PEOPLE. DONT' WORRY, CARO'LL BE SAFE  UNTIL THEY GET TO ME. THE BEASTMASTER'S GONE. AND I WOULD BE TOO,  IF I WERE YOU. VODEN WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. YOU COULD KILL ME,  BUT THESE ROPES HAVE LEFT MARKS HE'D UNDERSTAND. I'D TAKE MY CHANCES BACK HOME WITH THAT WALL OF ICE,  IF I WERE YOU. YOU'LL PAY FOR  THIS, TRACKER. I DON'T THINK SO. WHAT IS IT? I KNOW HOW TO FACE  THEIR WEAPONS. WHAT ARE YOU  TALKING ABOUT? WATCHING DAR FIGHT...  IT'S SO SIMPLE. USE YOUR ENEMYS' STRENGTH  AGAINST THEM. -THAT'S OUR ANSWER TOO.  -I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE CAN'T FIGHT THE PRIESTS  USING WEAPONS. WE DON'T KNOW HOW --  WE CAN INFILTRATE THEM. USE KNOWLEDGE TO DISCOVER  WHAT THEIR STRENGTHS ARE AND TURN IT AGAINST THEM. WE STOP LIVING IN FEAR,  BEING GHOSTS TO ONE ANOTHER. WE'LL PASS THE MESSAGE TO  OTHERS AND SEND YOU WORD. I KNEW YOU WERE OUR ANSWER. DAR, LOOK. RUH, HOW DID  HE GET HERE? I DON'T THINK MUCH  WOULD HAVE KEPT HIM AWAY. SHE WILL MAKE IT, WON'T SHE? YES, SHE IS. [ VODEN ]: BEASTMASTER, A WORD, IF YOU PLEASE. CARO. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS. REST EASY, BEASTMASTER. I MEAN YOU NO HARM. -PERHAPS NOT TODAY.  -PERHAPS NEVER. IF YOU WERE TO JOIN ME, IT MIGHT MAKE LIFE  EASIER FOR US BOTH. YOU HAVE LOYAL FRIENDS. THIS ONE DID NOT BETRAY YOU. FORTUNATELY, LIKE YOU, I HAVE EYES EVERYWHERE. WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOUR FRIENDSHIP, YOUR HELP. I APOLOGIZE FOR...OUR INTRUSION. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU COME HERE WITH WARRIORS. YOU TURN AWAY. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER MET  ANYONE LIKE ME BEFORE. I'M NOT A MINDLESS BRUTE  LIKE KING ZAD. I LEAVE YOU WITH YOUR TIGER, YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR LIVES, FAVOURS WHICH SHOULD  PERHAPS BE REPAID. COME SEE ME IN XINCA. -THE PRIESTS WILL KILL US.  -NO. THE PRIESTS WON'T HARM YOU.  I PROMISE. NOW, I BELIEVE YOU  HAVE A TIGER WAITING. WE'LL TALK ANOTHER TIME. GO, AS FAST AS YOU CAN. COME WITH ME. SOMEDAY WE'LL BE  TOGETHER IN XINCA. GO! LET'S GO. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WE COULD TAKE HIM NOW. HE HAS A DEDICATION  TO HIS CREATURE'S WHICH WILL TAKE SOME EXPLORING. IT TAKES GREAT SKILL  TO TURN DEFEAT INTO NEW PURPOSE, ARINA. A TRAIT OF POWER WHICH YOU  WOULD DO WELL TO LEARN. AND YOU'LL KEEP  YOUR WORD? UNTIL I KNOW  WHAT WILL BREAK HIM. BACK TO XINCA. WHAT'S SHE DOING? SHE'S ASKED FOR PASSAGE  TO THE FOREST BEYOND. -HE'S COME FOR HER.  -YEAH. SHE'S HOME. YOU CAN SEE? DAR!  [ GROANING ] I FORGOT SOMETHING. THOUGHT YOU  WERE ON THEIR SIDE. SO DID I.
