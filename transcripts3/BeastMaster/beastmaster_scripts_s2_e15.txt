  SOUND THE ALARM! SOMEONE'S STEALING THE HORSES! OVER THERE! WHAT'S HAPPENING,  HJALMAR? THIEVES, MILORD.  THEY'VE STAMPEDED THE HORSES. WHERE WERE  THE GUARDS? NO ONE SAW ANYTHING --  THEY SWEPT IN OUT OF THE DARKNESS  WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND. THEY DISAPPEARED...LIKE GHOSTS. GHOSTS HAVE NO NEED  FOR MY HORSES, HJALMAR. FIND THEM.

 YES, MILORD. HORSES. THERE'S MORE OVER HERE. FRESH. TAO? A SMALL HERD, GRAZING, I'LL BET. THERE'S PLENTY  TO EAT AROUND HERE. THESE ARE EXCELLENT  FOR SORE MUSCLES. UH? WE'VE DOING  SO MUCH WALKING LATELY, MY FEET AND LEGS ARE KILLING ME. SO WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED  IN THESE HORSES? TRACKS ARE DEEP.  THEY CARRY MEN. NORDS? THEY'RE THE ONLY  PEOPLE I KNOW

 WHO ENSLAVE HORSES. ENSLAVE? DAR,  I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, BUT SOME WOULD SAY  THAT A FRIENDSHIP CAN BE FORMED  BETWEEN MAN AND HORSE. ONE IS FREE AND THE OTHER ISN'T.  THAT'S NOT A FRIENDSHIP. [ GALLOPING ] -HORSES.  -THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY. -THEY'RE ALL AROUND US.  -WE'LL STAY HERE. I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY THAT. THERE'S YOUR WEAPON. YOU KNOW THAT I'D LOOSENED IT. DOESN'T MATTER. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE  THE THIEF WE'D BEEN TRACKING. -WE'RE NOT THEIVES.  -WHERE ARE OUR HORSES? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. LAST NIGHT,  KING VODEN'S BEST MOUNTS WERE STOLEN; WE WANT THEM BACK. WELL, I CAN'T HELP YOU. WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. TAKE THEM. DAR! I'LL BE BACK, BEASTMASTER. WHO WAS THAT? TAO? WHOA, WHOA, EASY, EASY, EASY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. LET HIM GO. WHO ARE YOU? THE ANIMAL IS OURS. WE WILL TAKE HIM.  TURN HIM LOOSE. TAKE HIM. YOU COMMUNICATED WITH HIM. WHAT DID HE SAY? THE HORSE WILL BE SAFE WITH HIM. -HE'LL FINALLY RUN FREE.  -YOU SURE? IT WAS EXACTLY  THE SAME FEELING I HAVE WHEN I SPEAK WITH THE ANIMALS. BUT HE'S A MAN. YEAH. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... -YOU LOST TWO MORE HORSES.  -AND TWO MORE MEN. MEN I CAN REPLACE.  HORSES ARE SCARCE. I'M PLANNING  A CAMPAIGN, HJALMAR. EVERY HORSE WE HAVE IS WORTH  ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD. I'LL GO BACK AND  TRY AND TRACK THEM. WHO WERE THEY? MOUNTED ARCHERS,  A MAN AND WOMAN. THEY RODE AS IF  THEY WERE BORN ON HORSEBACK --  THEY USE THE BOW WITH A SKILL  I'VE NEVER SEEN. THEY SURPRISED US WHILE WE WERE  QUESTIONING THE BEASTMASTER. WAS THE BEASTMASTER WITH THEM? NO, HE WAS AS SURPRISED  AS WE WERE WHEN THEY RODE IN. AND YET THEY ATTACKED YOU  AND NOT HIM, WHY? ORDINARY THIEVES DON'T ATTACK  TRAINED SOLDIERS, HJALMAR. THEY MUST BE SOME ADVANCE PARTIES FROM ONE OF OUR ENEMIES. WE'RE SURROUNDED  BY THOSE WHO WISH TO DRIVE US FROM THESE LANDS. SEEMED TO ME, THEY  SIMPLY DIDN'T FEAR US. THEN THEY MUST LEARN TO. DAR, I KNOW WE HAVE TO KEEP  GOING, BUT...WE'RE ON FOOT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH THEM  ANY TIME SOON. HE MIGHT HAVE THE SAME SKILLS I DO. HE MIGHT BE JUST LIKE ME. NO. HE'S WILLING  TO KILL FOR THE HORSES. -CURUPIRA SAID TO RESPECT LIFE.  -THEN WHAT? I DON'T KNOW,  BUT I HAVE TO FIND OUT. [ CHUCKLING ] WHAT IS IT? SHARAK'S FOUND THE ARCHERS.  THEY'RE NOT FAR. -INCLUDING THEIR OWN?  -THEY'RE WAITING UNRESTRAINED. -WHAT'S HAPPENING?  -WE'LL KNOW WHEN WE ARRIVE. BUT WE'RE ON FOOT...  NOT THAT THAT MATTERS. I COULD WATCH THEM ALL DAY. THEY'RE SO PRETTY. THEY HAVE SUCH GRACE AND HARMONY WITH THEIR ANIMALS. YES, WELL, THEY WOULD,  WOULDN'T THEY? WHAT DO  YOU MEAN? NO, I'M AGREEING WITH YOU. HARMONY, CONCORD, PEACE.  NO ARGUMENT. WHAT'S WRONG? THEY DON'T BELONG HERE, DO THEY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE A POWER  THAT IS UNKNOWN IN THIS LAND, A POWER THAT EVEN MUCH  OF TIME HAS FOUND A PROBLEM. WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM? HA, HA, YOU WAIT. YOU'LL SEE. [ SIGHING ] [ GIGGLING ] IT'S SO LOVELY.  SUCH A BOUNTIFUL LAND. SO FULL OF PEOPLE  WHO DON'T DESERVE IT. WHAT LAND IS NOT? [ GIGGLING ] OUR LAND. MAYBE THINGS WILL  GET BETTER AND WE CAN GO  HOME SOON. YEAH, WELL, UNTIL THEN,  WE SHALL JUST HAVE TO LIVE WHAT ABOUT THAT MAN WITH THE  STAFF? HE FELT DIFFERENT. HE'S NOT OF THIS PLACE. HE CAN'T BE. I... I DON'T KNOW WHAT  TO MAKE OF HIM. THEY WANT TO ROAM FREE. [ LAUGHING ] PERHAPS WE SHOULD OBLIGE THEM. NIGHT'S FALLING.  THEY'LL BE RESTING SOON. WE KEEP MOVING,  WE CAN MAKE UP SOME GROUND. DAR, I CAN'T  TAKE ANOTHER STEP. -STAY HERE. I'LL GO ON ALONE.  -DAR, I KNOW YOU FEEL A CONNECTION  WITH THESE PEOPLE, BUT IF YOU FIND THEM, THEN WHAT? TAO, EVERY DAY, THE ANIMALS  I PROTECT, FACE NEW DANGERS. THERE ARE CITIES LIKE XINCA, THERE ARE TRIBES BEING DISPLACED BY GREAT WALLS OF ICE, NOT TO MENTION MEN LIKE ZAD AND VODEN. IF THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE,  SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP ME, THEN IT'S GOING TO MAKE SUCH  A DIFFERENCE FOR THE ANIMALS. BUT WHAT IF THEIR INTENTIONS  WEREN'T AS NOBLE AS YOURS? THEY HAD NO QUALMS  IN KILLING THE SOLDIERS. THEN THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON  I FIND OUT WHAT MY ANIMAL FRIENDS  ARE UP AGAINST. GOOD POINT. [ LAUGHING ] GET SOME REST.  I'LL BE BACK BEFORE DAWN. OHHH. WAIT, DON'T GO! WHAT ARE THEY? CENTAURS. CENTAURS. I'VE NEVER SEEN  SUCH CREATURES. WHY HAVEN'T YOU  TOLD ME OF THEM? AN OVERSIGHT, I APOLOGIZE. THEY'VE BEEN AROUND  ALMOST AS LONG AS I HAVE. WELL, THEN WHY  HAVEN'T I EVER SEEN THEM? THEY KEEP TO THEMSELVES MOSTLY. IN THIS AGE OF UPHEAVAL,  EVEN THEY MUST VENTURE FORTH INTO THIS PART OF THE WORLD. THE WALL OF ICE  HAS INTRUDED ON THEIR LAND. AND QUITE COVERED IT. SADLY, THEY WERE NEVER BUILT FOR THE COLD -- NOR WERE THEY  BUILT FOR THE HUMAN WORLD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, HUMANS COMBINE THE HUMAN  AND THE ANIMAL, THE RATIONAL AND THE INTUITIVE. TO VARYING DEGREES. BUT THE CENTAURS,  DON'T YOU THINK THEY'RE A BIT OBVIOUS, A TOUCH CRUDE? THEY'RE NOT CRUDE. THEY'RE PURE. THEY'RE PERFECT. THEY'RE RELICS, THROWBACKS,  PAST THEIR PRIME. BUT... THEY DO HAVE A POWER  OF THE IMAGINATION, AND THAT MAKES THEM A DANGER. WHAT SORT OF DANGER? THEY TEND TO INSPIRE THOSE  IT IS BEST NOT TO INSPIRE, BRINGING CHAOS  GALLOPING AFTER THEM. -SO YOU SAW THEM CHANGE?  -YEAH. -AND THEY WEREN'T JUST SHADOWS?  -NO, I SAW THEM. THAT'S HOW I CAN COMMUNICATE  WITH THEM. THEY'RE ANIMALS. I'VE HEARD LEGENDS  OF SKILLED RIDERS AND ARCHERS WHO COULD TRANSFORM  INTO WHAT YOU SAW. NOW, BECAUSE OF  THEIR ANIMAL NATURE, THEY DISOBEYED THE NECESSARY  LAWS AND RESTRAINTS THAT MAN HAS PUT UPON HIMSELF, OBEYING  ONLY THEIR ANIMAL INSTINCTS. BUT THEY'RE FREE. AH, BUT MORE FREE  THAN ANYTHING ELSE. IT'S A GOOD DAY FOR HUNTING. YES, MILORD. I KNOW FORTUNE  WILL FAVOUR US TODAY. YOU RIDE ALONE? LESS CHANCE THEY'LL  HEAR ME COMING; MORE CHANCE  I'LL CATCH THEM BY SURPRISE. I DREAMT OF THEM LAST NIGHT,  RIDING LIKE THE WIND BEFORE OUR ARMY,  SHOWERING OUR ENEMY WITH ARROWS, CRUSHING ANYTHING  THAT STOOD IN THEIR WAY. IT WAS MAGNIFICENT. YES, MILORD. DON'T LET THEM KNOW  THAT YOU FOUND THEM. IF THEY'RE THE WARRIORS  YOU DESCRIBE, THEY'D RATHER FIGHT THAN ACCEDE TO MY WISHES. BE CAUTIOUS. THEY WILL BE YOURS, MY KING.  I SWEAR. BREAKFAST? SUCH SERVICE. [ LAUGHING ] AH! HOW SHALL WE SPEND  THIS GLORIOUS DAY? THE ONLY ONES STILL PENNED  ARE THOSE THE WARRIORS RIDE. NOT MANY OF THEM LEFT. ONE CAPTIVE IS  ONE TOO MANY. DON'T WORRY. WE'RE NOT LEAVING UNTIL  WE'VE FREED THEM ALL. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WE MEAN YOU NO HARM. SAGITTO... WE HAVE FOOD. JOIN US. THANK YOU. SORRY I SURPRISED  YOU LAST NIGHT. HOW IS IT THAT YOU HAVE  THE POWERS THAT YOU DO? IT'S A LONG STORY. VERY LONG STORY. WHERE ARE YOU FROM? FAR FROM HERE. AND YOUR HOME? OUR HOME IS WHERE  WE FIND OURSELVES. ALWAYS A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE. AHEM. HOW QUICKLY AN INTEREST  BECOMES AN OBSESSION. I'M NOT OBSESSED.  I'M JUST TRYING-- I'M WELL AWARE OF WHAT  YOU'RE TRYING TO DO, MY DEAR. BUT INTERVENTION  IS OUT OF THE QUESTION. INTERVENTION?  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? EVENTS TAKE THEIR COURSE. THERE IS A TIME FOR ALL THINGS AND A LOGIC, WHETHER  YOU GRASP IT OR NOT. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?  YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU? WHATEVER IT IS MY  SENTIMENTAL FRIEND, THE OUTCOME  WILL NOT BE DECIDED BY YOU. OUR LAND WAS A PARADISE, HIDDEN  FROM MEN'S EYES. THE FIRST YEARS, WE FLOURISHED IN ISOLATION, BUT NOW... THE ICE AGE AND THE MIGRATION. WE WERE OVERRUN. THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH  OF US TO TURN THEM BACK. AND THE ICE COVERED  OUR LAND TOO. SO WE SCATTERED...  TO FIND NEW LAND. AND WE FOUND THIS PLACE,  WHERE THEY ENSLAVE HORSES. I MUST SHOW YOU SOMETHING  YOU MAY FIND INTERESTING. JUST HOLD THIS. A LITTLE INVENTION OF MINE. PUT THE BERRIES IN THE TOP. PUSH DOWN AND THE JUICE... COMES OUT THROUGH  THE BOTTOM THERE. IT'S FASTER. YEAH. NOT AS MESSY EITHER. CAN I TRY? OF COURSE. [ LAUGHING ] -HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS.  -IT'S JUST SIMPLE -MECHANICS, REALLY.  -THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE ARE. WE LIVE BY INSTINCTS,  BY OUR WILL. WE ACCEPT LIFE.  WE DON'T THINK ABOUT CHANGE. WELL, CHANGE  ISN'T NECESSARILY A BAD THING. PERHAPS, BUT HUMANS  ARE NEVER SATISFIED. THEY STRIVE TO CLIMB HIGHER,  TO DOMINATE. ONES LIKE US ARE LEFT BEHIND. HE FEELS SOMETHING. SO DO I. SOMEONE'S APPROACHING. NO, THEY'RE ALREADY HERE. RADIA! NO! HE'S TAKING THEM TO XINCA.  WE'LL GET THEM. -YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.  -THERE'S NO TIME. WE CAN'T SURVIVE  WITHOUT THEM. IF WE'RE SEPARATED  FOR EVEN A FEW HOURS... WE'LL DIE. BRILLIANT STRATEGY. I KNEW YOU WERE WORTHY  OF YOUR RANK, HJALMAR. -THANK YOU, MILORD.  -LOOK AT THEM. THEY WON'T GIVE UP. THEY'RE LOYAL TO THEIR ARCHERS. LET'S JUST HOPE THE ARCHERS  ARE LOYAL TO THEM. THEY'LL COME FOR  THEM, MILORD, I'M SURE OF IT. THEY'VE ROPED THE MARE. THAT'S IT, EASY. EASY. AHH, AHH... OH, WHAT HAPPENED,  WHAT HAPPENED? [ GROANING ] SOME PAIN, AS IF I'D STUMBLED. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. [ GROANING ] IF THAT HORSE HAS BEEN LAMED, YOU WILL BE LAMED...PERMANENTLY! WHAT IS IT? WE'RE AS ONE WITH OUR HORSES. A SINGLE SPIRIT IN TWO BODIES. YES, IF SHE WERE INJURED,  I'D SHARE IN HER PAIN...AHH! I CAN TRAVEL FASTER ALONE.  YOU TWO CARE FOR HER. -I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU.  -TAO CAN STAY. I'LL GO. HE'S RIGHT. GO. HURRY. [ GROANING ] WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. THE CENTAURS  HAVE LOST THEIR HORSES. WITHOUT THEM, THEY'LL DIE. YOU REALIZE THIS IS  PURE SELF-INDULGENCE. I CAN'T STAND BY  AND WATCH THEM BE DESTROYED. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  WE MUST. THERE'S NOTHING  TO BE GAINED FROM BECOMING EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED. HOW CAN YOU BE SO CRUEL? NOT CRUEL, SIMPLY ALOOF. IT'S MY JOB AND YOURS. THEY NEED OUR HELP. THEY NEED OUR ATTENTION.  THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. PLEASE, LET  ME HELP THEM. CENTAURS PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THEIR FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE. IF YOU HELP, YOU TAKE THAT AWAY. LEAVE THEM TO THEIR FATE. IF THEIR TIME HAS COME,  THEN WE MUST WATCH THEIR DEMISE WITH RESPECT. NO. OR IF THEY SHOULD BE SPARED, IT MUST BE IN A MANNER THAT LEAVES THEIR VISION  OF THEMSELVES INTACT. DON'T BECOME INVOLVED. YOU'LL THANK ME THAT YOU DIDN'T. VODEN'S COMPOUND'S INSIDE THE CITY GATES. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A CITY. YOU'RE NOT MISSING MUCH. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,  I COULD TAKE... NO. I CAN KILL THEM BOTH. WHY? WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ENEMY. THERE'S NO REASON  TO RAISE AN ALARM. THERE'S NO NEED TO KILL. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND YOUR ANGER. WE'RE HERE TO SAVE YOUR HORSES. WE CAN'T DO THAT  IF YOU DON'T CURB YOUR INSTINCTS  AND USE YOUR HEAD. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? FOLLOW ME. [ CHUCK;ING ] HAVE OUR SENTRIES  DETECTED ANYTHING? NOT YET. I EXPECT  THEM AT NIGHTFALL. WE'LL POST GUARDS AT ALL -THE GATES AND CORRALS AT DUSK.  -I WIN... DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.  YOU LEFT YOURSELF OPEN. FORTUNE FAVOURS THOSE  WHO DO THE UNEXPECTED. MAKE SURE OUR  SENTRIES ARE ALERT. WITH THESE ARCHERS IN MY ARMY,  WE WOULD BE INVINCIBLE. WE'RE INVINCIBLE NOW. I STILL WANT THEM ALIVE. I MUST SEE THEM  IN BATTLE. UNDERSTOOD? THIS WAY. THERE'S A TUNNEL INTO THE CITY. NOW, THIS SHOULD HELP. IT MAY FEEL A LITTLE BIT  HOT...SOOTHING. -UH, MAY I?  -OF COURSE. AHHH... YES, IT FEELS HOT. IT FEELS GOOD. I LIKE IT. I TOLD YOU... IT'S BEEN  A GOOD DAY. I NEED A HAND  WITH THESE. HEY...THE HORSES ARE NEAR. I CAN SENSE THEM. COME ON. THERE ARE GUARDS EVERYWHERE. VODEN MUST BE EXPECTING US. SEND HIM OFF.  HE'LL GIVE US AWAY. WE NEED TO ACT. THERE IS  NO TIME. RADIA WILL DIE SOON. WE WAIT. GOOD. -STAY HERE.  -WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TRUST ME. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT WORK  THIS QUICKLY BEFORE. -I'VE CHANGED THE FORMULA--  -SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED. THEY FOUND THE HORSES. AH. NO, NO, DON'T YOU SEE --  YOUR BALM'S HAVING AN EFFECT ON MY MARE. OF COURSE. RUB IN SOME MORE? MY PLEASURE. THE HORSES! THE HORSES! THE HORSES ARE LOOSE. NO, THEY'RE HERE. COME ON! THIS IS OUR CHANCE. COME ON. THEY'RE COMING. STOP THEM! DID YOU SEE THAT? AFTER THEM. I SAID GET OUR HORSES. WE'RE GOING AFTER THEM. NOW! YES, MILORD. I MUST HAVE THAT CREATURE. HALF MAN, HALF HORSE. THE IMAGE SETS MY MIND ON FIRE. YES, MILORD. A HUMAN'S SKILL  AND THE SPEED OF A STEED AND APPARENTLY  CHANGE FORM AT WILL. IMAGINE A PHALYNX OF SUCH  ARCHERS GALLOPING DOWN ON THE ARMIES OF OUR ENEMIES --  WHO WOULD DARE STAND BEFORE THEM -- WE MUST  FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE FROM. -WHERE THEY'RE FROM?  =MUST BE A LAND NEARBY. I'LL WAGER THERE'S  HUNDREDS OF THEM. PERHAPS THOUSANDS --  WHEN WE CAPTURE THESE TWO, WE'LL FORCE THEM TO TELL US WHERE THE OTHERS ARE. BUT SUCH WARRIORS  MAY NOT WARM TO YOUR SERVICE, MILORD. WE ALREADY KNOW  WHAT THEIR WEAKNESS IS, HJALMAR -- THEIR DEDICATION TO THEIR HORSES  WILL BE THEIR DOWNFALL. HALF THE BATTLE IS ALREADY WON. SAGITTO. SHE'S GROWING WEAKER. I KNOW. WE HAVE TO HURRY. I CAN FEEL HER GETTING CLOSER. THEY'RE COMING. THEY'LL BE HERE SOON. LIE DOWN NEXT TO ME, TAO. -WHAT?  -LIE DOWN NEXT TO ME. I'M COLD. I NEED YOUR WARMTH. PLEASE. [ GROANING ] THEY RIDE AS IF  BORN ON HORSEBACK. YOUR WORDS WERE WELL-CHOSEN,  HJALMAR. THEY'RE MAGICAL. THEY'RE FREAKS,  MONSTERS FROM SOME BYGONE AGE. BUT DID YOU SEE THE EFFECT  THEY HAD ON THE MEN? THEY WERE TERRIFIED,  AS WERE YOU -- CAN YOU IMAGINE AN ARMY OF CREATURES LIKE  THAT -- NOTHING WOULD BE OUR OF OUR REACH...NOTHING. -SAGITTO, WE GOT TO STOP.  -WE CAN'T STOP. -HANDLE THE PACE.  -THAT'S WHY WE MUST MOVE. UNLESS SHE AND RADIA ARE JOINED,  THEY'LL BOTH DIE. MAYBE IT'S NOT TOO LATE. SHE SAYS SHE CAN MAKE IT. NO, NO, NO, JUST LAY STILL. DON'T TAX YOUR STRENGTH. I WANT  TO HELP, TAO. I MUST TRY  TO FIND MY MARE. NO, THEY'LL BE HERE,  AND YOU'LL BE GONE. THEY'RE COMING.  YOU SAID IT YOURSELF. THEY'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE NOW. JUST A MINUTE. YAH! YAH! THIS IS UNIMAGINABLE CRUELTY. FASTER! MUST WE STAND BY AND WATCH SUCH  BEAUTY ERASED FROM THE LAND? NOT NECESSARILY. BUT WE MUST STAND BY. IT'S ALL RIGHT, TAO. I'M CONTENT. I KNOW SAGITTO IS ALL RIGHT. THIS ISN'T OVER. YOU'LL SEE. WE'VE SHARED SO MUCH, SAGITTO AND I. WE WERE NEVER APART. [ SIGHING ] THAT'S THE HARDEST THING. TAO... TELL HIM THAT EVERY DAY  OF MY LIFE WAS JOYFUL, FULL, BECAUSE OF MY LOVE FOR HIM. WILL YOU TELL HIM? YES. YES, OF COURSE. RADIA. RADIA! OH, RADIA. RADIA. RADIA. RADIA. HEY, HEY, RADIA. RADIA. OH, NO! GET HER ON THE HORSE. IF THE HORSE LIVES, SHE'LL LIVE. RADIA... RADIA, PLEASE COME BACK TO ME. WELL, THAT WAS TOO CLOSE. TOO CLOSE BY FAR. THERE THEY ARE! VODEN. THEY'VE CHANGED BACK AGAIN.  ARE THEY NEVER THE SAME? AS I SAID,  THEY'RE MONSTERS. OUR TURN TO PROVIDE THE HELP. YOU CAN'T OUTRUN  THEM CARRYING US. -WE WON'T LEAVE YOU HERE.  -WE CAN'T STAY HERE. YES, WE CAN. GO AHEAD. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I CERTAINLY  HOPE SO. WHAT HE ALWAYS DOES --  DEFENDING SOME DUMB ANIMAL FROM BECOMING PART OF HISTORY. -NOW WHAT?  -HE WANTS A FIGHT? AND HE'LL GET ONE... THERE HE IS! FASTER...YAH! I'LL NEVER DOUBT YOU AGAIN. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. AFTER THEM, YOU IDIOTS! GO! I HOPE THAT  WASN'T TOO TRAUMATIC. IT WAS, BUT I UNDERSTAND. GOOD, BECAUSE IT WAS  YOUR MOST IMPORTANT LESSON. WHAT WAS PUT IN MOTION  HAS CREATED THE DREAMS AND DESIRES  THAT DRIVE ALL CREATURES. AND WE MUST NEVER  ALLOW THEM TO FEEL AS IF THEY HAVE  NO CONTROL OVER THEIR LIVES. CORRECT -- EVEN THOUGH  THEY DON'T. HA, HA, HA... ANY OTHER REASON  YOU TRIED TO STOP ME? WELL, TO BE QUITE FRANK,  I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU MESS IT UP. YOU TEND TO BECOME  EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED, AND THAT INVARIABLY  LEADS TO MISTAKES. IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING, YOU DO SEEM PLEASED  WITH THE OUTCOME. WHY SO HAPPY TO SEE  THE BEASTMASTER SAVE RELICS AND THROWBACKS? YOU MAY NOT HAVE  NOTICED THIS, MY DEAR, BUT I'M SOMEWHAT  OF A RELIC MYSELF. AND ONE DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE  OLD FRIENDS FAZED OUT. I'D HAVE MISSED THEM. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND YOU ACCUSE ME OF  BEING SENTIMENTAL. IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE. SO WHERE WILL  YOU GO NOW? UH, WE DON'T KNOW. LOWLANDS PERHAPS. WE'VE HEARD TALES OF A PLACE THAT'S GREEN, LUSH  AND SAFE FOR HORSES. THERE WILL BE A HOME FOR US. WE'LL FIND IT SOMEDAY. PERHAPS WE'LL RULE IT  WITH MORE THAN JUST INSTINCT...  IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. I'M SURE OF IT. TRAVEL SAFELY. BYE, TAO.  HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU? ACTUALLY, I HAVE  SOMETHING FOR YOU. HA, HA, HA,  THANK YOU. TAKE THIS AND SOME  FRUITS AND BERRIES. YOU'LL NEED THAT. WHAT IS IT? I'LL SHOW YOU  TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST. WE'LL MEET AGAIN. THANK YOU. FAREWELL. WHAT DID HE SAY? HE SAID THAT FREEDOM  IS WONDERFUL. BUT FREEDOM COMBINED  WITH RESPECT FOR OTHERS IS MUCH MORE REWARDING. [ SIGHING ] CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
