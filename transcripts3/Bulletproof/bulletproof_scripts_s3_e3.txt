 'We're British police, and we are looking for that missing girl.' I'm not sure if I'm ready for another child. Hmm? Five years ago a neighbour reported a domestic disturbance at William and Megan's house. I'll talk to her. Where's the missing girl? I moved the crew to Red Hill. She was still alive. I require urgent assistance at Red Hill. You don't have to do this! There is a little girl in there. We need to get in there now!

 Take her... Is she good? Is she all right? I got her. Check the house. I think it is clear. Yo, guys, with me. Come. Let's go! Hey, buddy. Do you remember me from the beach? Yeah. I've been looking for you with your mum and dad. Are you OK? All right. Nobody is gonna hurt you anymore. Did anyone hurt you? Let's get a medic here?! We got her, boys. We got her. Everything's gonna be fine. OK? Yeah. Get the medic, boys. Get the medic here. Let's take you patched up. Yeah, let's go. ♪ Would you take a bullet? ♪ Would you bite the gun? ♪ I fall on to my knees

All my life I just wanted to be a police officer, so, yeah, and to get an opportunity to work on a case like this, and to help save a life, this has been a dream come true for me, but I'm just doing my job here. No, no, no. Please, don't paint me a hero... If it's heroes you want, you look over there... And their wonderful female Branch Commander Tanner as well, for the record. Sir, can I ask a few questions? No, no questions. Hey, kid. Hi. It's good to be home? Yeah. Do your mum and dad get along? Do my mum and dad get along? I guess they did for at least five minutes, eh? Yeah. No. Just ignore that. You don't know what that means, do you? No.OK. Good. Just pretend I didn't say that, right. What's that? This, this is a little thing I have to take my mind of things sometimes. Y'know sometimes you just get a bit anxious or stressed and you just want to... Hey. Hey, man. I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. I am gonna miss you too. It has been a pleasure. Little one. What's wrong? Are you OK? That... that smell... I remember it. Smells like... Apples... Yeah. Yeah. Bruv, I knew it! Didn't I tell you? Didn't I? I knew it! I never liked him from the off. You know I got a sixth sense about these things. I sensed it was him. I sensed it! I get what you're saying, but there's a small thing we need and that's called evidence. When Kayla smelt the thing, that is evidence enough. You should have seen the fear in her eyes, I was there. I saw it. And how did he get to the safe house before us? We were on motorbikes! Keep your voice down. I am not calming down, no, man, no! I hear what you are saying but that's just a hunch. We need evidence. When we got her, when he looked at me, he knew that I knew. He knew that I knew. He knew. That's all very well, but what do you want us to do? Go and kick down the police station door, say you looked at us wrong and you're coming with us? We need something to pin on him. That might actually work, man. We're in South Africa, corruption is rife, clearly. I am going to check something out. Go and pack, get on your flight unless you hear from me. Why? Where you going? Come on! Where you going? What you doing? Mummy said. Said what? Mummy said to help me pack. The best way to help is to stay out of the way. You got ten minutes. Then come straight back. Flight leaves soon. Ron. Can we talk? You said you didn't wanna have the baby, so there is nothing to talk about, is there? I didn't say that. I just wanted to know what it would look like? Well, he'd look like me, hopefully. Come on, be serious. What would life be like? How would we cope? Babe, do you know that I would do anything to make this work. Like I'll do the school run in the mornings, I'll... Really... I'll make them breakfast. I'll help with homework. Just say yes. Just say yes. I don't know. Come here. Just say yes. Maybe. "Yes, geezer!" Yo. I need you to find someone for me. "Hit me." Yeah, I will if you call me geezer again. Listen, er... date of birth 15th of the 11th, '55. Female. Esme Juniper Lewis. And don't tell anyone about it, all right? "Yeah, sweet. I am all over..." So, does it ring any bells? No. Look, it's from a motel. It was recovered from the crime scene and it should've been checked in for a ballistics report. No bullets were checked in for me, and I'd know cos I am the department. Which officer's responsible? Pike! Where are you?"I am on my way to the airport, what's up?" Pull over and send me a pin. I'm coming to you. Hey.Hey.Oh, listen, I'm so sorry about the other night. I was actually looking forward to it. A pity you're heading back to London now. I was gonna suggest we, you know - Yeah. Shame, but duty calls. You look a bit, erm... Is everything OK? I hate flying. You could always delay it? I don't think so. The bullet I recovered from the motel never made it to ballistics. Yeah, because Dewald fired it maybe? Just before we showed up? He was standing there when we walked in. That could've been us. But he had no reason to kill us. He had every reason to kill Jo though. Jo spoke, the whole five million would've been gone.Yeah. Worth kidnapping a little girl for. So he commits a crime, investigates it, kills his own gang and comes out looking like a hero.Yep. Right, what do you wanna do, check-in closes in a couple of hours. You tell me, bro, I ain't got fuck all else to do. What sort of father would I be if I let these corrupt police get away with murder, man? We know it was him. Let's get the evidence and prove it. "I've got eyes on him, boys. You're clear." Yeah, ma'am, we're going round the back of his house now. Yo. This guy's got two '65 Mustangs, yeah. I don't know anything horses, man. Hey, listen, I thought I'd tell you. Arjana's pregnant. What? Yeah, man. How did that happen? Come on, bruv, I laid her down on the bed... You never laid nothing down, she got on top of you, man. I know who runs that house. I mean, when did you get time to do that? Or are you one of them quick guys? Congrats anyway, man. Yeah, thanks. Heads up. He's on the move. "OK." You're going in my pocket, so if you hear anything weird, ignore it. "OK, but make sure you can hear me." Shit, I think... I think he is going home. Milky. Din-dins. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Shit. Kity! Milky... You're struggling against an old woman. She's strong. Use your muscles, that's what you got them for. How am I supposed to feed the damn cat if you double-lock the bloody door, Gene. Come on. Yeah. I'll boot you through the window. Fucking hate cats. He's almost at the house. Boys, he's outside, get out now! Can you hear me? "You need to get out of there now." Hey, Bish... Shit, he's going in. "Bishop! Bishop! He's coming inside! Can you hear me?!" He's what? He is coming inside. You need to get out of there now. Quickly! Yo.What? We need to leave right now. If there's evidence, it's probably in there. Bro, the guy is coming. Right now we need to go. "Ma'am. We're out. We're all clear." Yeah? Yeah, on my way. Hey. Sit down. She's a beauty, eh? Pike, we'll stay with Dewald, you follow the old guy. On it. He's entering the building. I'll send you a pin. Bro. You're clickin', man. What do you think you'll have this time, a boy or a girl? Bruv, I am not gonna lie. I mean I could do with a boy. Yeah.Yeah. That is true. Not at all, doesn't matter to me. All a child needs is a parent that... that cares about them. Loves them. You know? Whoever they are, wherever they are, it doesn't matter. Hmph. You know what I mean? You talking about your kids or are you talking about me? What do you think, bro? You know, I can't imagine a world where... I not had a child that I didn't see. And I can't imagine how that child would feel, do you know what I mean? Every day not knowing where they are, where they come from. Must be the hardest thing in the world. It's important. You wanna know the truth, bro? The truth is you know me, man. You know me. And if I look, I go all in. And to be honest, I am scared about what I might find. It's just important that you look, though, bruv. Are you ready? Yeah, man. Who's gonna take the guard? You take the guard after your Colour Purple speech. You take the guard. So what, you take the old man, yeah? All right. I'll play you for it. Tsk. There you go. I'm angry now, so don't complain if I beat him up. Go. Go. Go. Hey, Mufasa... Come here... Agh! Jesus! I don't keep anything in the shop at night, I swear! We're not here to rob you, old man. Then what do you want?! Dewald. Who? The man that you were in the coffee shop with earlier. You mean Jacobson? He's a diamond dealer. What's the big deal, man? He's responsible for kidnapping a little girl. Did you hear that? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. When are you trading with him? Wait! Tomorrow. Are you sure? Yeah! Are... you... sure? Yes! Yeah?! He's coming now. "Nobody makes a move until he's exchanged the rubies." How's it? All right, here we go. Just one gate. Anyone could come in here, you know? Why, who... who'd wanna get in? No, I'm just saying, security is not very jacked. No, no, it... it's jacked. Is it? Yeah. Are you OK? Sure. Fine. Now, you got those ruby stones on you? I'd like to get my eyes on them now. No, mate, I haven't got any stones. Yo, yo, yo. What's going on? Think you got the wrong guy. He knows. I am in the wrong place. Sorry to have wasted your time. Shit! Let's just grab him. He must have the stones on him. Can you let me out? Ma'am? Now! Hey, Tanner, he's passing me now. What we doing? What we doing? What are you doing? Call it! Ma'am? "Just calm down." We can't be sure that he's got the rubies on him. He must have the stones, otherwise what's he doing here? Ma'am? And if he hasn't? What then, huh? We'll end up in jail and he'll be gone. "This is a joke, team. We are just gonna let this guy walk scot-free?" He's a murderer. For God sake... "We couldn't risk it." Maybe it's time to involve the police, tell Thato what we know. "He is the chief of police." Yeah. That's a great idea. A great idea. For all we know, they're in on the swindle together. Do you know what, boys, get back in your fucking boxes! We might be off book, but I'm still your boss! I don't wanna listen to this shit, man! Hi. Hey. Hello. Hello. William? I know what you are. Megan... Can I ask you something? Yes, of course, you're more than welcome to stay, I wasn't gonna ask that. I just wanted to know how things were between you and William? Well, actually, he's been amazing. Really? Hmm. Shoot. What's wrong? Er... I just... I just need to dash. OK. One of my colleagues forgot the keys to the store. You don't mind, do you? No, no, no. I don't mind. Do you want some company? No. You stay, I'll be back. If you're hungry... Karabo will fix you an omelette. OK, cool. Call me if you need me... I've never made an omelette in my fucking life. Oh, you... "Mrs Sincadu?" Hi, this is Megan's friend, she just popped out. "Oh. Can you please ask her to contact the school as soon as possible. Kayla's still a little distressed." OK. Sure. I'll go find her right away. "Thanks so much. Bye." Erm, the... Don't worry, we will be fine. Just go. I'll be at her shop, OK? Thank you for meeting me here today, sir. Because what I have to say is very sensitive.OK. I don't have unequivocal evidence, but I think it's highly likely that your officer Dewald was involved in the kidnap of Kayla. That is quite an accusation. Dewald is a highly decorated officer. Yeah. I appreciate that, sir, but he's buried evidence. What evidence? The bullet I recovered from the motel room never made it to ballistics, and there's this. He's had previous with the victim's family and he never mentioned it. He knew Megan. Weren't you supposed to go on a date with him the other night? I wouldn't call it a date, I'd call it more of a friendly coffee. So maybe this is just a case of a woman scorned? No, sir, I think it's a case of you being a chauvinist. OK, maybe we're both jumping to conclusions. Yes. OK. Look, if you don't take this seriously, Interpol will. Interpol here? So this is just gonna be another unsolved crime on your books then. I miss you. No, no, it's OK. Sit. We'll be fine here. These people aren't interested in us. I'm sorry, OK? Uh-huh. Things got a bit messed up. Why the hell did you change the plan? You were supposed to ask William for the money, not get him to steal the rubies. Asking William for money was never gonna work. It was only gonna lead back to you. So, yeah, I came up with something more elaborate. You were supposed to take her to a suite at the Hilton, OK, not some bloody township! Yeah, I know. I know. The plan changed. But I promise you, she was fine. When is this gonna end? Hmm? Did you do it? The rubies, did you swap them? You didn't do it?! It was too dangerous. I could feel Starsky and Hutch watching the place. What the hell are we gonna do then, huh? Hey, they're still worth money. It's enough for us to get away, but we need to move things forward, OK? We need to move today. We need to go right now. What about Kayla? What about school? We are taking her with us. All right? I've got a car packed. All you need to do is get in it. I'm scared. No, this is just so messed up. I know. Now, this is our chance, baby. Don't bail on me now. What is it? No, it's nothing. Pick up. Come on. Shh... It's gonna be fine. I promise you. I know what you're thinking. I'd like to hear from Megan, seeing as you called me a friend. And then you put your own daughter in harm's way. Why? You were so kind to me, OK? You have no idea how I just wanted to tell you everything. How did he manage to slip the net? He wouldn't have. He'll still have things to tie up. I just can't think where it will be. Megan's calling. Hello? And you were right about William. He... he's tortured me for many years. Here, hold on... "He kept me under lock and key. He abused me." He put me in a hospital. He broke my spirit, he broke my heart, he even broke my ribs. "He kept me away from the world." See, he is a man with power in a city where money is like a God worth dying for, and you can't just walk away from a man like that, you need to reinvent yourself and you need to start again, and that costs money, doesn't it?! That's worth kidnapping your own daughter for?! Surely not. That's Arjana. See, you married a kind man, so maybe you won't understand, but when you spend every day being spied on, being beaten because of the timing of a look, or because you didn't set the table correctly, then maybe you will see my point of view. So I chose to be happy. And I did it for myself and I did it for Kayla. It's OK, baby. It's OK. I'm sorry. Judge us by what we want, not by what we've done. Hey, that's Dewald... I don't wanna hurt you. But if you come between us and our freedom... Then what? Where are you taking me now? We're gonna get Kayla from school. To the school. Go! Let's go! I loved her from the moment I first laid eyes on her. Years back, I was responding to a domestic disturbance, husband and a wife. There were clear signs of physical abuse, but she wouldn't talk. Yea, but I could see what was going on. This fucking country... A white man reports a crime, no-one hangs around, police act. A coloured woman reports a crime and she is the one that ends up hanging. But what you two did... No, this was me. I persuaded her... to do this. As terrible as you might think it is... Pfft. Life may be cheap down here, but a second life isn't. She's my meisie. I'll do anything for her. Kayla, just don't make me force you. Just please... No. Kayla? Kayla, please get up. Please get up? I don't know, she doesn't want to come. Kayla, just pick up your bag, let's go! Let me out! Kayla, come on. No! Let me out, OK? Just let me out! Whoa! No, no, no, no! He's got Arjana in the car! No. No, no, no! It's all right, darling. I hope your old man can drive. You don't stand a chance. Go round. Go round. Jeez! Take it easy. Bruv, what do you mean, take it easy? That is my wife in there. I know. Buckle up, bro. Bro. I am not sure this is an off-road vehicle. Yo, you know we missed him, right? Shit. So what, more madness to come, yeah? Yep. You know it. Give him credit, your old man can drive. Yo! Yo! Maybe not. Come on! Baby, come here, come here... Hey, Bish, Bish, go, man. You need to get him. You need to get him, baby. I am not going anywhere. I'm not going. I'm not leaving you. You have too... I am not fucking leaving you! Do you love me?! Yes. Yes. He could have killed us. He could have killed our baby. OK? Call Tanner. All right? Yeah. OK. Imari, I need backup. I'm on the beach at Monwabesi. I'm injured and I am being pursued by those damn cops from London. They are trying to kill me. Just get me backup and tell them to shoot to kill. Bro, what is this place, man? Drop whatever the fuck that is? Bro, this really helps with my stress levels -Drop it! Come on, walk. Hey, Pike! Out there in the open, so your buddy doesn't surprise us. Come on, man, this is over for you. For you maybe. Hey, Pike! I've got your partner! Come out before I put a bullet in his head! You know you're not gonna get away with this, right? Is that so? Mm-mm. You think the police are gonna believe you over me? I'm a decorated officer. So am I. You've got five seconds, or you're going home alone! Five... Four... Three... Two... One! All right! You got me. Yeah? You're damn right I have. Agh! No! All right, go on. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. I only wanted to help her! Shut the fuck up! You ever fucking touch my wife again, do you understand?! I will fucking kill you! Kill you! I fuckin' love her, man! Don't ever fuck with a man's family, clear? Freeze! Police! Hey. Get back! Whoa, whoa, whoa! We're on your side! We're on your side! Put down your weapons or we will drop you! It's about time, boys. Hey! Hey! Not them! Him! Now come on. Please. Come on! Come on! Dewald, you're done. Take him away. Come on. Bro, what did I tell you? Distraction. God, man... Didn't I tell you? Bro! This was a distraction. This saved our lives. Don't hate on the cube. This is photographic evidence your wife has been collecting for years. She claims to have CCTV footage as well. And she's prepared to take the stand against you. Now, we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way. Take care, bro... I'm so sorry... I just... I just love my daughter more than anything. I just wanted us both to be safe. And I just wish my life was simple. Yeah, but it's not, and now you're gonna spend a lot of years in jail away from your daughter. Deservedly so, I might add. We know you got dealt a bad hand, no doubt about that, but you... Played the worse cards possible. Take her away, boys. I just want... Bro... What? I always wanted to say that, "take her away, boys".No, no. What? How comes you're saying the words that I am gonna say? No, I didn't. I didn't say anything. You finished my - Sentences. No, I didn't. You are doing it now. I'm not. You keep on finishing my sentences. I say the last thing to the criminals, it kinda works that way. Nah, bruv, it can't be like that all the time. Sometimes you gotta let me say what I need to say. You should've been faster then. Yeah? Yeah! Yeah? Yeah! All right. Yeah! Yeah? This one's gonna run. You love me though. Let me talk to you outside. Let's go. Talk to you outside. What are you talking about? You can have your little thing but I can't. What's up? I just wanna talk to the kid. Go do your thing, yeah? All right. Love you. Hey. Hi. Listen, I am not gonna lie to you, kid. The road ahead's gonna be tough, all right? There's gonna be times when you just... You're gonna find yourself alone and that's gonna hurt. You turned out all right. You know what? You're gonna turn out all right too. Thanks. Come here. OK. Here... Thanks. You're welcome. I feel like it is gonna be a girl. Why are you saying that? Why are you jinxing it? What's wrong with you? I'm not. I think it's a girl. Do you wanna know? Of course. She's right. Oh, my God! See? Oh, baby, you will be fine. The girls love you. Another one. Yeah. It's all good. Thank you. There you go, darling. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Yo. Yo, man. What's that? What's what? Whaddya mean, what's what? What? That brown envelope. You was looking at something. It was a work thing, man, just... Yes, lads. What work thing? What you talking about? Hello. Hey! How are you? You good? Missed ya? Yeah. Missed you too. What's going on, you got... Yeah, you looking well. You looking sun-kissed. Yeah, you know, got my bathing suit out, you know. Got a bit of sun. So how was it? Good holiday? Anything exciting happen? Ma'am said you may have got into a little bit of a scrape. Well, I mean, it was... it was all right. Yeah, it was all good. It was all right, yeah? We got through. What did you guys get up too? You left us alone with him, so thanks. We ain't stopped, it's been full on. We had to step up to the plate. Like every day, what would Bish and Pike do? That's a lot of responsibility. I've had to step up. Did he actually step up though? No. I'd love some food if there's any food going. Yeah, burgers over there. Why have you all got your phones out? Look at that, look! Come on.
