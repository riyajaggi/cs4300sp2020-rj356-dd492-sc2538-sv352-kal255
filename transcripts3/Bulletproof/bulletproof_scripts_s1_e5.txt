 Michael Sharp, I"m arresting you on suspicion of armed robbery. It was my deposit box that they stole. What was in it that was so valuable they wanted to steal it? Evidence. Valuable enough to keep me alive. TANNER: You had Sharp in your custody and now he"s dead. PIKE: The guy had his kid dragged out of his arms, fam. She had her kidneys taken out while she was still breathing. That"s him. You"re a good man who did his best for his family. - Just here"s good. - What?

 Ali"s school just sent me a text saying she"s absent. - You did drop her off, right? - Yeah, course I did. What, at the gates? You saw her go in? I know your house, where your children go to school. They are safe... as long as I"m safe. Oi, Bish! No! - What is wrong with you, man? - We have to let him go! - You don"t understand! - He played you for a damn fool. You had him in your house! [Yells] [Thunder rumbles] [Rain pattering] Right, so what do you wanna do? I wanna keep my family safe. OK. Arrangements are being made.

 As of now, you"re temporarily excused. A true officer would not let a dangerous criminal go when he has a chance to catch him. And a true father would make sure their daughter gets to school safely. - This is on you, Bish! TANNER: I"m not having this. You both made judgment calls. Live with the consequences. Bish? Yeah, that"s right, walk away, usual. Hey! [Pike sighs] Look, there"s some truth to what he"s saying. But you did act like a father and not a cop. Your family is in danger until we take Bakur down. We"ll move you to a safe house tonight. PIKE: This won"t be for long, I promise. What about Pinky? You"ve enough toys, sweetheart. Pinky will keep your bed warm. OK? - OK. - All right, let"s go. [Music blaring] Go! Go, go, go, go. Go! Go! Go! Go! Yeah. It"s cool. Is Bakur really coming to kill us? ARJANA: Ronald? Your daughter"s asking you a question. It"s OK. We're safe. ♪ Would you take a bullet? ♪ Would you bite the gun? ♪ I fall onto my knees ♪ And yes, the war"s already won ♪ Through dark nights ♪ We burn bright till the sunset ♪ Till the sunset ♪ Through dark nights ♪ When it all goes wrong ♪ When it all goes wrong ♪ I"ll take my time, I"ll keep on holding on ♪ When it all goes wrong ♪ When it all goes wrong, oh-oh ♪ When it all goes wrong, I"ll pull myself together ♪ Keep on holding on BOSCOE: They"re part of our detail. PIKE: Are they? I appreciate the strain you"re under. It"s my job to alleviate that. It"s important that you stay in the house at all times. Yeah, good luck with that. Sir? You don"t know me very well, do you? But it"s my phone. What about Snap? You should have done this last night. Anyone could know we"re here now. - It"s abuse of my human rights! - Ali, give him the phone. Give him the phone, Ali. We"ll do our best to make you comfortable. Not much fucking chance of that. Sorry, girls. This isn"t where we want to be, right now, so... [Mobile ringtone] Well done. Thanks for seeing me, sir. I just wanted to... I don"t have long, Bishop. What is it? Well, I just came here to talk about your son, sir. Well? Well, I just er... I think he needs er... He is exactly where he needs to be. Safe, off the street. Well, I was going to say that he needs you, sir. But you interrupted, so I didn"t get a chance. As a father or a Director General? A father. What do you really want to say, Bishop? I just think that, right now... it"s important that you are there for him. Know what I"ve always admired about you? Tell me. You just say it as it is. - I do. Yeah. - Mm. - You"re comfortable with that. - Mm-hm. And you are right where you are supposed to be. You"ve reached your summit. You"ve touched your zenith. And along the way, you and my son have enjoyed a successful partnership... until now. He has desires beyond today. He has a lust for enhancement. Some people might call that ambition. And nothing is forever, is it? When he"s ready, there are opportunities for him. Anyway... I just came to tell you that your son needs you. I"m sorry if we got any wires crossed. Gonna take one of these, in case I need to holler at you. Hold tight, yeah? [Door opens and closes] [Panting] - [Entry alert chimes] - Hi. [Traffic report on radio] - Are you following me? - Do what? I said, are you fucking following me? No, mate, I"m just getting some crisps. Show me your ID. - Bakur sent you, didn"t he? - Oi! Who do you work for? I don"t even know what I"ve done! You"re working for Bakur! Please! I"m just a lorry driver! Bakur led us to you, Gazim. Why are you protecting him? You"re facing charges of trafficking, - attempted murder... - He"s scared of Bakur. But we need him to fucking talk. You"re not helping yourself, Gazim. You tell us where Bakur is and we can discuss a deal. You think about it. Everything you"ve learned about ethical practice... your internal moral compass, your compassion and understanding, your humanity... I want you to forget it all, and do whatever you need. Let"s help Pike and his family sleep a little easier. Do you think you can do that, Officer Bishop? Bishop. Kev. My man. Um... CCTV in the compound. Be great if it could break down for an hour. [Whistles] Gents. I wonder if you guys could help me with something? [Music masks dialogue] I told those men what you do for a living. How you make profit at the expense of innocent young lives. And look er... the CCTV cameras have stopped working. Strange coincidence. Don"t know what happened. So, listen. I need you to tell me where Bakur is. OK, he"s all yours, boys. OK, stop! [Laughs] Are you serious? You think you can intimidate me by using some random builders? They haven"t got the balls! OK, guys. Guys, thanks, don"t worry about it. I"m gonna deal with it. Keep the money. Can I borrow this? Cheers. Thanks very much. Don"t worry about it. Thanks a lot, man. [Train rumbles past] Aargh! [Whimpers] Now, I"m not gonna ask you again. OK, I talk! You"re a wise man. Come on. Come on, Pike, pick up. Jesus! VOICEMAIL: The person you are calling is not available. OK. Thanks to Gazim, this is what we"ve found out about Bakur. He owns this restaurant. We pulled this image from CCTV from the off licence next door. It"s grainy but it"s definitely him. He thinks he"s safe, hiding in plain sight, using this restaurant as a front, "while making a fortune trafficking kids" body parts. But remember what he does and keep that image in your head when we go in there. Kamali, Munroe, I need you in position A. Nell, you"re gonna be with me. What about me? You"re gonna be on surveillance, but back at base. Any questions? - I need a word. - Shoot. - Not with Jonesy around. - Not after last time. [Laughter] - In private. - Ha-ha-ha! Prep! What"s up? You want my ten cents" worth? You"re gonna get it, anyway. You think catching Bakur will make you feel better, hm? He harvests children"s body parts, Nell. Think Pike"ll forgive you for fucking up if you deliver his head on a plate? It wasn"t a fuck-up, all right? Take the emotion out of it, all right? He"s a target, not some form of absolution. You"d still want his head on a stick, wouldn"t you? - Oh, yeah. - Good. I"m here. - I"m trying to lay the table. - No, I was here first. Dad! [Knock at door] It"s OK. It's OK, it"s just Auntie Charlotte. Hi. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming. There you are, my darlings, a little surprise. Thank you. - Ma"am. - Oh, for God"s sake! - They"re just gifts! - Please, ma"am. Did you manage to bring anything with you? No, we had to leave immediately. No work? Erm... of course I"ve had other things on my plate. But... I"ve just got people breathing down my neck. I suppose I can fend them off for a bit. Oh. Oh, he"s a barrel of laughs. - Oi, Ronnie! - Ssh! Did you hear that? [Rustling] It"s probably just the wind. - Ron, there"s no-one there. - Everything OK, sir? - Take the kids upstairs. - Ron! Upstairs, now! Go on! I"m going outside. There"s someone out there. - Girls. - Sir? Get your fucking hands off me! - Sir, let us deal with this. - You do not have the skill. All right? Come on! Show yourself! [Rustling] [Police radio chatter] Pull over. Munroe, Kamali, go round the back, make sure nobody gets out. Let me know when you"re in position. [Exhales] Yo, Bish, we"re in position. Make it quick, it stinks around here. BISHOP: Copy. [Music playing inside] I want you to cover the door. I"ll deal with him. You need backup, make sure you shout, yeah? Hey, stay there! Stay there. Where"s your boss? Where"s Bakur? Huh? Motherfucker. Police! [Pounding on door] Don"t run or I'll be forced to shoot you. [Grunts] [Bakur calls out] - Get him! - [Chef yells] [Groaning] [Grunts] Yaargh! [Grunting] KAMALI: Yo, Bish. You OK? It"s gone all quiet in there. Suspect down. [Bakur groans softly] I couldn"t save him. Never fuck with a man"s family. [Panting] [Exhales] [Ringing tone] Dad. It"s me. My boy. How are you enjoying your new living arrangements? I can"t do this any more. I"m out. I want the job. I need to get off the streets. For Arjana and the kids. You "ve made the right decision. I" ll see you tomorrow. Good night, son. [Call disconnects] [Muffled dialogue] DONNA: Uncle Bishop"s here! Come on, man, we can get back to normal. He"s gone. Bakur and his crew are finished, man. Bish... I"m out, man. I"m taking the job. What do you mean, you"re taking the job? I"m handing in my resignation, bro. - What about me? - What about me? I can"t drive that car on my own, no. What about my family? You can"t just leave me, man. What about Sharp"s murder? You don"t want to know what happened? My three girls. I can"t put my family through this shit any more, bro. - It"s safe for you to go home. - Bish! Bish. It"s done. It"s too late. Undo it, man! No. [Horn blares] [Door squeaks open] Munroe, man, I just wanna say you"ve been doing great work. - What work? - Thank you so much. Hug me back, man. Yeah, good work. I appreciate it, seriously. All right, let go. Let go. I"ll drop... I'll drop you... Somehow I knew this wouldn"t have a fairy-tale ending. Everyone has a breaking point. And I totally respect your decision. I"m really pissed off with you, Pike. Not because I don"t think you"ve made the right call. Not because I don"t understand that you need to protect your flock. And not because you"re not capable of great things in other departments. But because I"ll fucking miss you. Because you"re a really, really good copper. But more than that, you"re... You"re just a good man, Ron. I need to take my family home. [Door closes] [Keyboard clacking] Bish. Fancy a hot date? I"m not a quitter. Just dinner. Dinner where? I thought I"d introduce you to my family. I don"t love Chinese food, you know. Fucking hell, you"re basic. [Door closes] You all right? Another dumpling, Aaron? - Oh, yes, thank you, please. - I like a man who eats. Especially an older one. She usually goes for young, good-looking guys. Mum, let"s go and sort out dessert, yeah? You like my sister? [Both laugh] Ohh! I"m only joking, bro. - That was good. That was good. - But do you? Er... well, I mean... You know. She"s... [Clears throat] Um... very... You know, we work together, so, you know... She"s... Yeah, we're kind of... Don"t you like her? - That"s not what I said. - Cos she"s Chinese? No, I didn"t say that. Just, you know... - She"s kind of er... - He"s only joking. - You"re all right. - [Chuckles] Yeah. For a copper. - Older copper. - Mm. Sharp was killed for a reason. And we were taken off the case for the same reason. I mean... And why was Sharp never charged? I mean, he was arrested but he was never charged. He was arrested once for drug trafficking. Once I could figure out, but twice? No. If Pike thinks I can"t do this on my own, then he"s wrong. I"m gonna figure this out, even if it"s the... What? What? There"s something quite fuckable about you when you"re on one. Yeah? Yeah. Mm. - [Door closes] NELL: No. Yeah. Do you actually live here, or did you burgle it? Well, I mean, it"s a work in progress. I couldn"t stay at Pike"s forever. That looks comfortable. - It"s romantic. - No, it"s homelessness. Can you just not argue, for one single solitary second? - Can you just try that? - Well, can"t you just shut up? - Yeah? - Yeah. [Panting] Bish? [Phone buzzes] [Phone continues buzzing] [Ringing tone] Graham Borlock? Get off my fucking property. What you gonna do, spanner me to death? I need to ask you about Michael Sharp. - Who? - I think you heard me. Name and rank? - Who said I was on the Force? - I said, name and rank? Aaron Bishop. NCA. Let"s talk about Michael Sharp. You arrested him twice... and both times he got off. And you don"t strike me as a type of person that would let that go. I"m retired. Leave me alone. Never gonna happen. Sense of morality got the better of you, Aaron, eh? A conscience can be a dangerous thing, son. Why, what happened? Why was Sharp never charged? Told you - I retired for a peaceful life. Good for you, mate. But what about your conscience? Why don"t you let your sense of morality get the better of you and give me a hand? Off my property. [Car door closes] Chop-chop. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Good. MAN: In some respects, you could call us the gatekeepers of the gatekeepers, whose job it is to keep the whole show on the road. Opportunity awaits, young man. A chance to emulate the success of your father... [Dialogue fades out] [Clears throat] You all right? - Yeah, yeah. - Er... parcel for you. - Where is it? - At the front desk. If you want a secretary, yeah, ask Munroe. - Yo, Kev. - All right, Bish? Bishop. Nell. Are we cool? Er... yeah. We"re cool. As in everything between us is all right, yeah? Yeah. Why shouldn"t it be? So... what happened last night, you know, we"re... we"re good with that, yeah? Yeah, we"re good with that. - Business as usual? - Business as usual. OK. - Good? - Mm-hm. I"m going. [Papers rustling] Motherfucker. ARJANA: The Masons? That"s not us. I"m working. [Message alert] Not sure I can live with you if you take this job. You can"t live with me if I don"t. [Message alert] [Pike sighs] For fuck"s sake. There"s something I"ve got to do. I"m not here to argue with you, Pike. But you need to know the truth before you sign your life away. Sharp was never arrested because he couldn"t be. And there"s a reason he was never arrested. PIKE: That"s you and Sharp? You wanted us off the Sharp case cos you didn"t want us to know the truth... humiliated me because we were getting too close. [Pike Senior sighs] I wanted to protect you. No, you didn"t. Everything I"ve done is to protect you! Yes, I knew Sharp back in the "80s." Yes, he"s always been bad news. I wanted you off the case... because nothing good has ever come from our attempts to put him behind bars. So why didn"t you just tell us that you knew him, Dad? Why didn"t you tell us he was an ex-cop? That was 30 years ago. I told you we came across him, that he"s slipped the net a number of times. And how did he manage that, Dad? Huh? You and Sharp was in something together. Now he"s dead... and I wanna know why. I have no idea why he"s dead and I have no idea who killed him. He was a bent cop and you protected him! Look, for once, just tell the truth! For once in your life, just tell the fucking truth! - Careful, boy! - What were you and Sharp doing? You"re on thin ice! Son, there... there are things I-I want to tell you. But you want things to be simple - good, bad, black, white. - But this is complicated. - Oh, Dad, whatever. - Junior. - Get off me! All I"ve ever wanted was the best for you. You made me move jobs to get me out of the way... to protect yourself, your image... your legacy. It"s always been about you, Dad - some wannabe middle-class white-man"s puppet with a fucking club tie... and a secret handshake. Fuck me. I can"t believe... Why should I ever look up to you? All I"ve ever wanted to do was make you proud. More fool me. Do you know what? I know who you are. And I"m gonna find out what you did. Then I"m coming for you. [Door slams] We need to talk. [Car engine starts] - [Ringing tone] - Come on, Bish. - The number you are calling... - For God"s sake. [Phone buzzes] Yo, what"s happening, Pike? Yo, Munroe. Oi, hand Bish your phone. I need to talk to him, real quick. Er... he"s not at his desk, bruv. Well, find him, Munroe! It"s important, man! Come on! [Mutters] Come on. Come on. It"s Pike. He needs to speak to you. Only if he"s sorry. He says: only if you"re sorry. Just put him on the phone now, please! Mate. Nah, man, I need to know that he"s sorry. All right. All right, look. I"m sorry, yeah? MUNROE: He says he"s sorry. - He said that? - Yeah. Yo, man. I need to hear it with my own ears. Bish, I showed my dad the photos. He looked scared, man. He was on his phone. He"s acting funny. I"m tailing him now. Looks like he"s involved in some serious shit. Get mobile and come and meet me, yeah? Get Kamali to track Pike"s co-ordinates and meet us there. KAMALI: I traced Pike"s phone to Elizabeth Trading Estate, Juno Way, SE14. PIKE: Yo, Bish, are you mobile? It looks like we"re about to turn off. Two minutes, man, two minutes. This don"t look good, man. What the fuck"s he doing? He"s stopped. Looks like he"s waiting for someone. BISHOP: I"m nearly there, man. 30 seconds! [Motorcycle approaching at speed] Shit. No! Oh, fuck! Officer down! Elizabeth Trading Estate, Juno way, SE14! Dad, no! Bishop in pursuit of shooter. Fuck! [Tyres screech] PIKE: Get a fucking ambulance here now! [Tyres screech] Armed Police. Get off the bike! Get off the bike! [Motorcycle engine revs] [Engine revs] [Grunting] In another life... we three could be... partners. BISHOP: He said it himself. He"s a hired gun. That"s a job, it's not a reason. What do you want me to do with this? - The right thing. - You do know what that means? It"s me. I"ve found something out, it stinks, it"s not right or fair. That"s Arjana. What"s she doing there? [Yelling]
