 - Hurry up! - I'm trying. Come on! - Okay, okay, okay... - Come on. Did you hear that? No. Ah! Jesus, Bethany! You're killing us. Wait, I think it was... I-I don't know. It's right. I'm sure.

 Okay. Door! It's locked. Start looking. Hurry! Look... Going somewhere? Were we at least close? You know, you don't have to enjoy it so much. You got farther than the others. Maybe if someone hadn't wiped out. Come on, let's go get the others and hit McConnell's. - Was that... - Not part of the game. Go. Ooh!

 Oh, my God, Kennedy. Call 911 for Christ's sakes! Hey. When Daddy Warbuck's baby girl gets whacked, they call in the big guns, huh? I'm happy to crawl my ass back in the warm bed it came out of. I'd take that. What do we know? Kids all go to Central Chicago University. What are they doing all the way out here? Trespassing. They threw themselves a makeshift escape room. Theme was a prison break. That one is the "gamemaster." I guess a case of beer and a Bulls game is pass√© now. Yeah... Oh. Hold up, hold up. Meet Kennedy Malloy. Twenty-one. Senior at CCU. COD: a single gunshot wound to the chest. What about the weapon? It's MIA along with one of the kiddies. And the kiddie's name? Are you sitting? Abigail Chapman. I guess killing her squeeze while studying abroad in Spain - wasn't good enough. - Madre de Dios... - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - -- www.Addic7ed.com -- Kennedy was a total sweetheart. I can't believe she's gone. What about Abigail? I saw her before the game started. You heard the gunshot? Uh, I recorded it on my Snap Story. Okay, bitches. I'm kicking butt this time. You posted this video at 11:16 p.m. A gunshot went off and you didn't think that was weird? I figured it was a part of the game. This is Chicago. When's a gunshot not going off? Stacy and I didn't hear the shot. We were on the opposite side of the building. Did Kennedy ever mention any issues with Abigail? I didn't really know Kennedy. I'm a freshman. She's a senior. Abigail seemed cool. I never believed she killed that Spanish guy. A world famous ex-con and a prison break. Who wouldn't pay for that? Okay, you supplied the space, the clues, the rope. What about the gun? You supply that, too? To heighten the experience? I've thrown ten escape rooms before. No one has ever been hurt. So what the hell is an escape room? It's an interactive game. Players try to get out of real life or extreme situations using physical and mental dexterity. This one was a prison break. That's ironic. Each kid had to find his partner, who was tied up somewhere, then they try to escape together. So who was Kennedy's partner? Abigail. Kennedy Malloy's father is in Japan on business. The mayor would greatly appreciate it if we had the shooter behind bars before her father lands at O'Hare. My people are on it. What's there to be on? We know who did it. Abigail Chapman's been back from Spain... What, three months now? Do you have any idea what kind of press the "Vicious Vixen" will attract? If anyone's interested, Abigail was acquitted of her boyfriend's murder. There wasn't a single drop of her DNA at the crime scene. The prosecutor kept her locked up for three years before starting her trial. I was kind of obsessed with the case. My point is maybe it's too early to convict her. I wouldn't rely on the TV movie. I read two books, and the trial transcripts. The bottom line: if Abigail wasn't gorgeous, this case would have never gotten that much publicity. And if Kennedy's father didn't contribute to the mayor's campaign, CPD would be handling this. Justice. It's a wonderful thing. Find the girl. We need to talk to you about Abigail, Mrs. Chapman. Why would I help you? Because one of Abigail's classmates was found dead in a warehouse. You're going to blame her for everything? The other kids have cooperated... Your daughter is the only one who ran. Abigail could be hurt. There's nothing at the scene to suggest that. The hardest thing... harder than knowing your baby's in a prison thousands of miles away... is thinking that maybe you raised a murderer. If we could talk to her... I have no idea where she is! Can we take a look at her room? How many bedrooms you got in this place? Abigail wanted to live in the dorm. We compromised on the basement. You didn't trust her? I just got her back. Hm. Is your washer broke? It's how Abigail washed her clothes for the last three years. She's had trouble acclimating. Do you have any guns in the house, Ms. Chapman? God, no. Abigail's got an admirer. Who's Todd? I have no idea. Abigail at the park. Abigail at the bookstore. When she got back to the States, the paparazzi wouldn't leave her alone. She should've rented a cabin in Montana. - She was acquitted. - Right. Let me ask you this: would you let her babysit your kids? That's what I thought. There she is at Java Joe's. Ah! I think I found our Picasso. That looks like pastel chalk to me. - Do a reverse image search. - Okay. Todd Mitchell. He's 18. Goes to CCU. That looks like the store. Todd Mitchell? Investigators Dawson and Nagel. We're from the State's Attorney's Office. - What'd I do? - Your roommate told us you were here. We're looking for Abigail Chapman. We heard you guys were tight. - I haven't seen her. Sorry. - Whoa, whoa. You in a hurry? - My next class. - That's not what your roommate says. I meant work. Okay. Call me if she contacts you. Oh, jeez, sorry. - Let me help you. - I got it. Thanks. Follow him? I don't think those tampons are for mom. You think she's guilty? Which murder are we talking about? He's picking up the pace. She was 18 when she went to Madrid. She didn't speak the language. For all we know, she's a sweet kid. She's hot so she's innocent. Oh, come on, I didn't say I want to marry the girl. Who the hell is that? Gun! Don't make me hurt you, kid. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! She didn't do anything wrong! - I'm warning you. - I knew this wasn't safe. What do you want? It's her I want, man. - Not you. - Just leave us alone. Please! Out of my way, Bro-meo. Ah! No, please, please, please! No, no! Let go of the girl! Ah, come on, man! Turn around! I found her first. We can work a deal. Who sent you? State's Attorney's Office. - Your turn. - Spain. I'm a bounty hunter. Let me have her and I'll cut you in on my action. - How's ten percent? - That's it? Once a pig, always... All right, man! Shove off, man! Todd. Scram. I've got ID! Abigail, you're coming with us. - Following her since Madrid. - Let me see your ID! - I've got ID in my pocket. - Get up! Do you go to church? I used to go... Prison is the opposite. Church... It lifts your mind upwards... to a place... I don't know... Beyond the reaches of your soul. But prison... it pushes you down. Is that why you ran away? You don't want to go back? Maybe I'm just psycho! That's what they said about me in Spain so maybe they were right. Sit down. Maybe I... I just wanted to be one of the guys. Okay, maybe I just... I wanted to have friends. Tell us about Kennedy Malloy. I need to use the bathroom. Answer the question. Christ, I must have shot her! I must be a killer, right? This is painful. She's nearly there. I killed Kennedy. That's what you want me to say, right? Help us understand what... Nagel! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come here! - Come here. - Ugh! Settle down. Hey! Come here. Settle down. - We need a medic. - No, I'm fine. Not for you. - What? - She caught me by surprise. - I'm not gonna hit a girl. - Ugh! Abigail was on two different types of anti-depressants. Add a tab of ecstasy. Thank God stupid isn't a defense. Peter! - You forgot your phone. - Thanks. It was on my desk. U.S. Attorney Frank Harrison called about Abigail Chapman. Great. Who violated the girl's rights? Spain, or they're about to anyway. They want her back for a retrial. Hard to believe a country that invented paella hasn't thought about double jeopardy. Abigail Chapman is an American citizen, Your Honor. Pursuant to Article IV of the Extradition Treaty between Spain and the U.S., neither nation is required to turn over its own nationals. I have an affidavit from the State Department waiving Article IV protection for Ms. Chapman. Your Honor, she murdered a Spanish national. So tell me, what's the point of Article IV then? She was tried in Spain and acquitted, Your Honor. The Spanish prosecutor has presented new evidence, and filed for a retrial. It shocks the conscious that the U.S. Attorney's office is willing to send a citizen back to a system that ignores one of the rights that we hold so fundamental. Unfortunately, our Constitution doesn't buy her a cup of coffee in Madrid. Can I assume your motive isn't strictly humanitarian, Mr. Stone? Ms. Chapman is a person of interest in the murder of a CCU student. Where is she now? She's currently detained at a State psychiatric facility. It would be a violation of basic human... Like we used to say as kids, "Possession is nine tenths of the law." You have 48 hours, Mr. Stone, to formally charge Ms. Chapman. If at that time, charges have not been filed, I'll be forced to hand her extradition over to the U.S. Magistrate. Peter. Looks like we're famous by association. That's sick. Celeb Central. This picture was taken in the escape room. Find out who sold it to Celeb Central, and see if there are any more. Yeah. Okay, guys. I got a double sawbuck for anyone who can tell me who shot this photo. Nobody here, that's for sure. That cover was mine. That punk ass kid comes in like he's Annie Leibovitz and I end up on page 15. Now I'm out here with these knuckleheads, freezing my tush off, trying to get pictures of Selena swapping spit with The Weeknd. You wouldn't happen to have a name for that punk ass kid? - Nah, sorry. - Any of these faces ring a bell? Ah! Ah. I get that double sawsky, right? You're surprised the school booted you? A student was murdered at your escape room. Yeah, and last week, a sophomore choked on her own vomit at the Sigma Phi Party. Guess who still gets to attend CCU? How much did Celeb Central pay you for this? What are you, the IRS? We just want to know if you have any more. They're all time-stamped. Abigail's still tied up at 11:17. That girl with the Snapchat. The gunshot when off at 11:16. So Abigail couldn't have shot Kennedy. I'm sorry about before. I didn't know what I was doing or saying. You're going to arrest her? We're pretty sure that Abigail didn't kill Kennedy. Her friends, not so much. What can you tell us about the others? Not much, um... Margo likes to party. She hangs out with Stacy. What about Eric, Bethany, or Cindy? Bethany's sweet. She's in my American novel class. She wants to be a writer, too. She let me read one of her stories. I told you about it. It's a wealthy girl who is an animal activist, but runs around town in a fur coat that her father bought her. We kind of bonded. Bethany doesn't have a dad either. Her dad left before Abby's trial began. He thought she was guilty. I still don't get why you ran. The clanging. Clanging? At night, there was this guard... Victor. I was in my cell and he'd drag this metal chain across the floor... I'm sorry. Thank you. Will they send her back to Spain now? We'll do what we can to keep her here, Mrs. Chapman. If Abigail was tied up in there, the clanging had to come from over here somewhere. Or it might just be in her head. Yeah, maybe. You shouldn't have gotten her hopes up about stopping the Feds from extraditing her. Look at that. Like in the old movies. Huh. I'll bet that clangs. Maybe it wasn't in her head. A Walther... That's one fancy murder weapon. Abigail just became a material witness in a murder case. She ain't going anywhere. Ballistics says the gun Nagel and Dawson found is, in fact, the murder weapon. Tell me there are prints on it. Two sets. One is Kennedy's. The other isn't in any data bank... and there's something else... The gun was traced back to Kennedy Malloy. She was killed by her own gun? Yeah. I bought her the gun. It'It was a birthday present. She was 21. Wow. Kennedy... was single. She lived alone. I had... relocated to Kobe earlier this year to set up our offices there. I worried about her. I wanted her to have a gun so she could protect herself. From anyone in particular? There were over 4,000 people shot in Chicago last year. But no, she never said anything. Um... She did have a run-in with some students. They... filed disciplinary charges against her. They were ultimately dropped. What were the charges about? She was part of a group called the Madison Club. Uh... kids getting together, talking politics. They... they passed out pocket Constitutions on campus, and I guess... some people... were offended... and why not? It was written by dead, white slave-owners. Thank you for coming in, Mr. Malloy. Mr. Stone, uh... 13 hours on a plane. A father's mind can go to some dark places. Kennedy didn't... Suicide? No. Someone tried to hide the gun. - My condolences. - Thank you. She might as well have killed herself. You just heard her father. The gun was for her protection. She didn't use it to rob a bank. She did everything legally. Did her a lot of good. Talk to her friends at the Madison Club. This is the only country on the planet that teaches its kids what a bad country it is. Declaration of Independence. Bill of Rights. What a nightmare. Did... Did Kennedy die because we handed out the Constitution? That's what I'm trying to figure out. If you ask me, Professor Hall was behind that whole grievance thing. He teaches English, for God's sakes. Kennedy said he spent more time ranting about lefty politics than he did talking about Faulkner or whoever. Did she ever complain about it? And who would listen? She recorded one of his lectures. We were gonna go to the newspapers with it. Get his ass canned by the Trustees. What happened? Hall saw her phone on her desk.... realized what she was doing, and went ballistic. Bastard actually confiscated her iPhone 7. The next time, Kennedy was smarter. Do you want to hear it? Yeah. Gun owners are the enemy, people. Just once, I'd like one of these maniacs to shoot up an NRA office. Things would change in a hurry. This guy teaches American literature? There's more. They were petitioning for the right to carry concealed firearms on campus. They were expecting trouble so they had someone filming it. Kennedy, come here now. That is Professor Hall. You can't be doing this on campus. I have a First Amendment right. There were at least seven kids petitioning. Why did Hall single out Kennedy? Have Dawson and Nagel talk to him. I can do it. No, you'll be too busy writing a motion to delay Abigail Chapman's extradition. It's horrific what happened to Kennedy. I can't say that I'm surprised though. - Why's that? - On average, 12,000 Americans are killed by guns every year. Tell me about it. Binge-drinking deaths. Suicides. Car accidents. Opiate overdoses. I mean.. Why add firearms into the mix? Is that what you said just before you confiscated Kennedy's phone? First of all, it's school policy. No recording lectures. And second, if you guys think I had something to do with Kennedy's death, then you don't know a thing about me. We do know that you had a heated discussion with Kennedy outside the Student Union. What was that about? I was simply voicing my objection to conceal and carry. Why not voice it to the whole group? 'Cause Kennedy was the only one I knew. Let's be honest. We wouldn't even be having this conversation if Kennedy hadn't brought her gun to that escape room. Thank you for your time, Professor Hall. That's one pompous prick. We didn't release a statement saying that Kennedy was killed by her own gun. So how did Hall know? Someone who was in the escape room told him. Let's circle back through the escapees. See who knows the good professor. Work study jobs tend to be the least glamorous jobs on campus, but I... could be shoveling manure back in Fontana... - Kansas. - Shh! Mom sends what she can. She's alone. Dad died when I was one. Cancer. Sorry. You're in two of Professor Hall's classes this semester. Contemporary literature, and the American novel. Why? We heard that Hall and Kennedy had an altercation. Okay. It might have something to do with her murder. Professor Hall wasn't even there. Listen, I, uh... really gotta finish up with these so... Sure. Just one more thing. If you could take a look at these and tell me if anything jogs your memory? Nothing. Sorry. Thanks anyway. At least we got her prints. We got a winner. Bethany Pierson from the escape room. She belongs to the second set of prints on the murder weapon. Arrest her. - Again? - Bethany Pierson? Stand up. You are under arrest for the murder of Kennedy Malloy. - What? - Shh. I found traces of blood. Micro-spatter, to be precise, It'son the defendant's jeans. It was the victim, Kennedy Malloy's blood. I show you what has already been admitted into evidence as People's 17. Have you see it before? I dusted it for fingerprints. And what did you find? There were two sets of prints. One belonged to the victim, and the other matched those of the defendant. Could you determine how far the gun was from the victim - when she was killed? - Yes. From the burn pattern on the victim's blouse, the muzzle was between two and three inches away. Thank you. Now, can I assume you also studied the angle at which the bullet entered the victim? It entered the victim's chest at 10 degrees. So ten degrees would be like this? Give or take. But if I wanted to shoot you, wouldn't it be more like this? That's hard to say. You're right. It is. Let's talk for a minute about those fingerprints. The location of my client's, to be precise. There were multiple prints on the grip and the slide. A partial on the safety. And were Ms. Pierson's prints the only ones on the slot? No. Ms. Malloy's print was there, too. Go ahead. Show us. Kind of like there was a struggle for the gun when it went off. Kind of like self-defense... Thank you. No more questions, Your Honor. Why did you buy your daughter a gun, Mr. Malloy? It was because of my wife, Evelyn. - Kennedy's mom? - That's right. Kennedy was two... She was still asleep upstairs. Evie was in the kitchen. She had the dishwasher running. I guess I forgot... to lock the door on my way out that morning. That scumbag came in... He raped her. And he slit her throat. After the funeral, I bought a gun. And as soon as Kennedy was big enough to hold it, I took her to the range. I wanted her to know how to protect herself. Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Malloy. I only have a few questions. What did you buy Kennedy for her 19th birthday? A Birkin bag, I think it was. Wow! That costs what? Ten grand? And for her 20th birthday? Diamond earrings. 14 carat white gold. Roughly $18,000, isn't that correct? It's a milestone birthday. And for her 21st birthday, you bought her a Walther PPK 380 ACP. That was for her protection. From the less fortunate girls on campus? - Objection! - Sustained. The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun? That's right. Virginia Tech. Sandy Hook... they all could've been prevented. If the shooter hadn't had access to a weapon... Or if someone took him out before he started shooting. You say potato... Objection! Is that what you taught your daughter, Mr. Malloy? If someone points a gun at you, shoot first and ask questions later? That's right. Problem is... my client didn't have a gun. Maybe Kennedy should've asked first. Maybe then she'd be alive. Mind if I... - No, not at all. - Thanks. Uh... Dewars. Neat. Make it a double. Either they're getting younger, or I'm getting older. Nice job today. Attacking both the... The victim and her father. It's the profession we've chosen... "A well regulated militia comma... being necessary to the security of a free state comma... the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not infringed." That's the last Amendment I'd expect you to quote in a bar. The crazy thing... Me and you, we might not be here if not for that pesky second comma. And Justice Scalia. May he rest in peace. Only he could find an individual's right to bear arms in a punctuation mark. And not even an interesting one like a colon or an ellipsis. The Second Amendment ensures that every American has the right to protect himself. What if James Madison's finger just slipped, or his quill blotted? What if that second comma was actually unintended? Then a lot of living, breathing, innocent people might be dead. You say potato. Bethany was one of my best students. Smart. Enthusiastic. Always prepared. I never heard Bethany so much as raise her voice toward anyone. What about Kennedy? Kennedy was more outgoing. More self-assured. Dismissive of authority. Always ready to argue. - With you? - With anyone. She and her other classmate got into an argument over a line in "Daisy Miller." Long story short, Kennedy threw her book at her classmate's head. Professor Hall. In your literature class, you led a discussion on firearms and gun control, correct? My kids are well informed. The topic came up. What was Kennedy's position when the topic came up? Kennedy was pro-gun. And Bethany? Anti-gun. Is there a chance your opinion of guns colored your opinion of these young women? I'm guilty. Guilty of wanting our children... to be able to go to the park... or the movies, and not have to dodge bullets. Maybe it's not guns you oppose, but gun owners? They are bored adolescents yearning for a bigger toy than the kid down the block, and when they get it, they can't help themselves. It's all about their testosterone fueled egos. Now my job, Mr. Stone, is imparting knowledge and wisdom. What wisdom is more important than "don't buy something that might kill your neighbor?" And people who don't accept your wisdom.... Well... there will always be ignorant jackasses. Just so you know... I own a gun, sir. Figures. It was dark. All of the sudden, Kennedy was there, standing with a gun pointed at my face. I panicked. I thought I was going to die. I grabbed the gun. We struggled. It went off. Had you and Kennedy ever had words before? I never even saw her until that night. Thank you. You never called the police, did you? - No. - Instead, you hid the gun and continued playing the game. I didn't know what to do. I was scared. So scared you were willing to let another classmate - take the fall? - Kennedy was pointing a gun. So you assumed she was going to kill you? Yes! Only crazy people have guns. Look at all the mass shootings. Orlando. San Bernardino. If I didn't try to take her gun, who knows what else would've happened. Did you know that 2.5 million lives are saved each year by the use of firearms? 200,000 of them are women. It's propaganda. Just once, I'd like one of these maniacs to shoot up an NRA office. Things would change in a hurry. I shot Kennedy... and I'm really sorry... but I thought she was going to shoot me. Tough day? Losing always is. They're buying all that self-defense crap? Forensics says there may have been a struggle. Kennedy's dad looks like a paranoid gun nut who didn't want his spoiled baby bothered by the riffraff. Her professor painted her as a gun-toting hothead. Meanwhile, Bethany is the scared, little Kansas farm girl who didn't know the victim, and therefore had no motive to kill. Wait. Bethany said she didn't know Kennedy? Didn't meet her till that night. There's a chance Bethany's full of it. That story she gave Abigail. About the rich girl on campus whose daddy bought her a fur coat? You think it's Kennedy? I don't see how I can help. Bethany testified she didn't know Kennedy. You can prove she was lying. Another courtroom... You're not on trial this time. Just think of it as a conversation between you and me. What about the other lawyer? Bethany was gonna let you take the blame for Kennedy's murder. If we hadn't found the gun... Have you ever put someone away, Mr. Stone... who you weren't sure was 100% guilty? Yes. Do you ever think about them? I do. What if I say I can't do it? Then Kennedy's murder may go unpunished. It's up to you. Most people stared at me, or whispered behind my back, but Bethany... she sat next to me in a coffee shop one day. She thought that we might be kindred spirits. How so? She said that we were both outsiders on campus. She was from Fontana, Kansas, and... I was from a Spanish prison. Would you say you became friends? Yeah. We both lost our fathers... Although, hers died. Mine just... ran away. But she let me read a story she wrote about her dad. About how her life would've been different... if he didn't die. Can you describe the story? He was rich, and he gave his daughter anything she wanted. Did Bethany base the character on anyone she knew? She based it on Kennedy Malloy. So if Bethany said in court that she didn't know Kennedy... She'd definitely be lying. Thank you. The police arrested you for killing Kennedy. - Is that right? - Yes. Did you ever tell them about the story my client allegedly wrote? - No. - Why not? After what I went through in Spain... I didn't know for sure if Bethany had killed Kennedy. She was my friend. I didn't want her to go through what I did. When you killed your boyfriend? - Approach, Your H... - No need, Mr. Stone. You're out of line, Professor Bannon. True or false, Ms. Chapman? There's an outstanding order of extradition against you to be returned to Spain for retrial. True or false? - True or false! - True! I had this history professor. He was smart. Charismatic. He could tell you everything about France from the first revolution to the present. As far as I was concerned, he walked on water. - We got close... - Do I want to hear this? "Just once, I'd like one of these maniacs to shoot up an NRA office. Things would change in a hurry." That's Bethany on cross. Now Professor Hall... Gun owners are the enemy, people. Just once, I'd like one of these maniacs to shoot up an NRA office. Things would change in a hurry. Verbatim. I would have done anything for my history professor. He's what I wished my father would be... Bannon said he's going to call Bethany for surrebuttal. Just might work. Smart. Yes, I wrote the story, but I honestly don't know how Abigail got it. Why's that? Abigail was odd. I don't even remember ever talking to her. So your story wasn't about Kennedy? No. It was a fantasy, about what my life would be like if Dad had lived. This is the story in question, is it not? It is. Please read those last few lines. They're highlighted. "But Dad is gone, and this was all a dream. But sometimes, dreams are right there in front of us, and all we have to do is reach out and touch them." That's very beautiful. I'm... I'm surprised you never shared it to anyone. I might have. Who would that be? Not Abigail Chapman, that's for sure. Professor Hall? He said you were one of his best students. Yes, I showed it to him. What did he say? He liked it. He said I could be a writer. Said he would help. - Did he help you? - Yes. After class? Sometimes, but it's not what you're suggesting. He was my teacher. That's all. - Your favorite teacher? - Yes. He read your stories. He knew what was going on in your head. In your heart. He knew you like a father knows his daughter. Your dream, the one that was standing right in front of you, close enough for you to touch? Objection! Mr. Stone is testifying, Your Honor. - Sustained. - Professor Hall was that dream! - Your Honor! - He was the closest thing to a dad you ever had. Isn't that right? I don't know. What would you do if he left the school? He won't leave. He has tenure. But let's say the audio recording that Kennedy had of Professor Hall ranting about the evils of guns got out to cable news? I'm sure the Trustees wouldn't like that at all, and Professor Hall's tenure would be worthless, wouldn't it? And there goes your dream. Just like that. You couldn't let Kennedy destroy your dream, could you? I tried to talk to Kennedy... but she wouldn't leave Professor Hall alone. That bitch's father gave her everything! Why did she want to take mine away? In the case of the People of Illinois vs. Bethany Pierson, on the sole count of the indictment, First Degree Murder, the People find the defendant... guilty. Huh. I remember Gail's first year in college. She came home and yelled at me for taking part in an illegal war. Some hippie, draft dodger professor taught her I was the enemy. I yelled at my parents for wiping out the Native Americans. When did people start going to college to get stupid? We would've lost the case without her, Mark... You think I'm the enemy, too? I think you're a hero. You're full of... Get me the damn Secretary of State. What's the girl's name? Abigail... Chapman. Thank you. - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - -- www.Addic7ed.com --
