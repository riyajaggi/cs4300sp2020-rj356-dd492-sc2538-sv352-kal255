 MRS. MADISON? IN THE SPRING OF 1934, I'D BEEN LIVING AT THE STERLING ARMS APARTMENTS FOR A FEW MONTHS, AND I WAS USED TO SEEING MRS. BRADLEY FUSS OVER HER BUILDING AND US TENANTS PLENTY. MRS. MADISON. SO WHEN I GOT HOME THAT AFTERNOON AND SAW HER KNOCKING AT THE MADISONS' APARTMENT DOOR AFTER MRS. MADISON HAD MISSED AN APPOINTMENT... UM, MS. SMITH, HAVE YOU SEEN MRS. MADISON AT ALL TODAY?

 NO ONE'S SEEN A STITCH OF HER. NO, I'M SORRY. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER. I THOUGHT, "SURE. SHE WAS PROBABLY CONCERNED, BUT I BET SHE WAS ALSO CURIOUS." WE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE COUPLE, BESIDES THAT ERIC MADISON HAD BEEN EMPLOYED OVER AT THE MOVIE STUDIO. AND NELLIE WAS A WORKING WOMAN TOO, WITH LOVELY MANNERS. IS ANYONE HOME? AND I BET THERE WAS LITTLE THRILL IN TAKING A PEEK BEHIND CLOSED DOORS TO SEE HOW THE MADISONS REALLY LIVED. I MEAN, WHO HASN'T STOLEN A LOOK INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S MEDICINE CABINET OR DESK DRAWER WHEN YOU HAD A CHANCE TO.

 BUT WHAT SHE FOUND IN ROOM 123 WASN'T THE DELICIOUS PEEK INTO THEIR PRIVATE WORLD. MR. MADISON? BECAUSE THE MADISONS' SECRETS WERE A NASTY SLIDE INTO A NIGHTMARE. BURBANK IN 1934 WAS, IN MANY WAYS, STILL A SMALL TOWN AND A COMPANY TOWN AT THAT. WARNER BROS STUDIOS HAD SET UP SHOP RECENTLY, AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY GAVE WORK TO EVERYONE AND HIS BROTHER AROUND HERE. AND LET ME TELL YA, WE KNEW WE WERE LUCKY TO HAVE JOBS. THIS WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THE COUNTRY WAS HURTING. SO THE PICTURES WERE A WELCOMED DIVERSION. BUT EVEN THOUGH WHAT HAPPENED AT THE STERLING ARMS APARTMENTS WAS JUST AS MYSTERIOUS AS ANY STORY I'D EVER SEEN UP ON THE BIG SCREEN, IT WASN'T A FUN BIT OF FICTION. IT WAS REAL AND TERRIFYING. SUNDAY, MARCH 25, THE BURBANK POLICE ENTERED ROOM 123 OF THE STERLING ARMS APARTMENTS, WHICH IS OCCUPIED BY ERIC MADISON AND HIS WIFE, NELLIE. CALL IN THE LANDLADY. IS THAT MR. MADISON? YES. THAT'S HIM. THANK YOU. YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER, BUT WAY BACK THEN, THERE WERE HARDLY ANY PHOTO IDs, SO THE POLICE COULDN'T JUST GRAB THE DEAD MAN'S WALLET AND CHECK THE PICTURE ON HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE. THEY NEEDED THE HELP OF SOMEONE WHO KNEW THE FELLA TO IDENTIFY THE BODY. LOOKS LIKE THE POOR SAP TOOK IT IN THE BACK SOMETIME LAST NIGHT WITH, IT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT A .32, RIGHT? MUST HAVE BEEN DAMN LOUD, TOO. THEY DON'T FIND ANY SIGNS OF A BREAK-IN. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE BEEN A ROBBERY. THEY FIND NO GUN, AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE NELLIE IS. HOW LONG HAVE THE MADISONS LIVED HERE? JUST OVER A MONTH OR TWO. I DON'T KNOW THEM VERY WELL. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW MR. MADISON ALIVE? WELL, HE CAME IN ON THE LATE SIDE. MRS. MADISON WAS ALREADY HERE. SHE WAS TALKING WITH OUR CARETAKER, MR. McGUIGAN, IN THE LOUNGE. EVENIN', MR. McGUIGAN. AND AT ABOUT 10 O'CLOCK, ERIC MADISON WALKS IN... GOOD EVENING. AND SAYS HELLO TO THE MAINTENANCE MAN. MR. MADISON WAS LOOKING FOR WORK. JACK WARNER HAD JUST FIRED HIM FROM THE RESTAURANT OVER AT THE LODGE. WARNER BROS STUDIOS JACK WARNER? MR. MADISON, HE GAVE WHAT-FOR TO SOME FANCY DIRECTOR, I GUESS. WE'D ONLY KNOWN THE MADISONS FOR A COUPLE MONTHS, BUT AT LEAST, AT THAT TIME, WE THOUGHT WE'D HAD A GENERAL HANDLE ON THEM. ERIC MADISON HAD A BIG, GLAD-HANDING PERSONALITY. HE WAS ALWAYS WORKING AN ANGLE. AND THAT COULD RUB PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY. RESERVED, VERY POLITE. RESERVED WAS A GOOD WORD FOR NELLIE. HAVE TO GET TO THE TRACK SOMETIME SOON? SHE HAD A QUIET STILLNESS TO HER MANNER, LIKE SHE WAS KEEPING MOST OF HER THOUGHTS TO HERSELF. BUT THAT NEXT MORNING, I HAD TO WONDER IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF TROUBLE, A SECRET SHE WAS KEEPING CLOSE TO HER HEART TOO. SHE'S BEEN IN THE HOTEL BUSINESS, HERSELF. NELLIE WAS A REAL CAREER WOMAN. SHE HAD MANAGED A RESORT OUT IN PALM SPRINGS, EARNED HER OWN MONEY AND HAD EVEN, RECENTLY, INHERITED A LITTLE NEST EGG WHEN HER MOTHER PASSED AWAY. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. OKAY. GOOD NIGHT. AND THEN ERIC WALKS TOWARDS HIS ROOM, AND NELLIE MAY FOLLOWS. SO THAT WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAY EITHER OF THEM? NO. NO. NO, I WAS GETTING TO THAT. I SAW MRS. MADISON AGAIN, JUST AFTER THE GUN SHOTS. GUN SHOTS? WHAT WAS THAT NOISE? IT SOUNDED LIKE IT CAME FROM RIGHT HERE. MRS. MADISON ARE YOU ALL RIGHT IN THERE? MR. MADISON? YES, MRS. BRADLEY. I'M FINE. THANK YOU. MRS. MADISON, COULD YOU COME OUT HERE FOR A MOMENT? WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. DID YOU HEAR IT? WHAT'S THAT? THE NOISE. THE NOISE. THE RACKET. THEY MUST BE FILMING AT THE STUDIO NEXT DOOR. WHAT A RACKET. THIS APARTMENT IS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM A WARNER BROS LOT, WHERE THEY'RE MAKING A GANGSTER MOVIE CALLED "MIDNIGHT ALIBI." AND, IN THAT MOVIE, THERE WERE MACHINE GUN BURSTS THAT WERE GOING THROUGHOUT THE EVENING. AT THE TIME, NELLIE'S QUIET COMPOSURE FELT TOTALLY NORMAL. SHE WAS A "STILL WATERS RUN DEEP" TYPE OF LADY. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU SOON. BUT NOW THAT WE KNEW ERIC MADISON HAD BEEN SHOT IN THAT ROOM, THE QUESTION WAS WHAT WAS NELLIE'S CALM COVERING UP: A THREAT TO HER OWN LIFE FROM SOMEONE LURKING JUST BEHIND THAT DOOR OR A VIOLENT ACTION NELLIE HERSELF HAD COMMITTED? NO ONE KNEW THE ANSWER BECAUSE NELLIE WAS GONE, AND THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT IN ROOM 123 REMAINED HER SECRET, ALONE. SO THE POLICE WANTED TO TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS AND SEE IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT WHERE NELLIE MAY WENT. I WAS STANDING OUT IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING THIS MORNING, AND I GUESS IT WAS AROUND 9 AM AND, YEAH. I SAW MRS. MADISON COME OUT OF THE BUILDING. AND, SHE, SHE GOT INTO HER CAR. POLICE LEARNED THAT NELLIE WAS SEEN LEAVING THE STERLING ARMS THAT MORNING AROUND 9 AM. SHE LEFT CARRYING SOMETHING WRAPPED IN NEWSPAPERS. AND SHE DROVE OFF NOBODY KNOWS WHERE. THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT ANYBODY IN THE APARTMENT COMPLEX HAD SEEN NELLIE MAY MADISON. YOU THINK IT WAS HER? WELL, SHE DIDN'T LEAVE THAT ROOM WITHOUT NOTICING HER HUSBAND WAS ON THE FLOOR. MAYBE THEY BOTH GOT INTO SOMETHING NO GOOD. MAYBE SHE'S IN TROUBLE NOW. POLICE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO FIND NELLIE MADISON. SHE'S A SUSPECT. OR IF SHE'S NOT INVOLVED, WHERE IS SHE? IS SHE SAFE? SHE JUST SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR. A MURDER WAS A SHOCKING THEN, JUST A SURE AS NOW. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY ERIC WAS KILLED, FIVE BULLETS IN THE BACK BESIDE HIS BED, AND HIS WIFE MISSING, THAT HAD AN EXTRA TWIST OF MYSTERY. AND IT HAD EVERYONE ASKING, "WHAT HAD BECOME OF NELLIE MAY AFTER SHE LEFT THE STERLING ARMS APARTMENTS AND PROMPTLY VANISHED?" BY MONDAY MORNING, NELLIE MADISON'S PICTURE HAS APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS. POLICE SAY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A BEAUTIFUL BLACK-HAIRED WOMAN. THIS HAPPENED LESS THAN 24 HOURS AGO. IT'S, LIKE, SHE DISAPPEARED FROM GREATER LOS ANGELES. THIS WASN'T AN ERA OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. YOU CAN'T TRACK PEOPLE. AND THEY CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH MORE WITHOUT NELLIE MAY MADISON. CAPTAIN BRIGHT? YES. CAN I HELP YOU? CHARLES BROWN. POLICE HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY A MAN NAMED CHARLES BROWN. I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I DON'T KNOW THE WOMAN THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, BUT SHE USED TO BE MARRIED TO MY BROTHER BEFORE SHE MARRIED THE DEAD GENTLEMAN. DIVORCE? IT WAS QUITE UNUSUAL TO BE DIVORCED IN THE 1930s. THAT IMMEDIATELY MAKES THEM THINK, "WELL, WHAT KIND OF A WOMAN IS THIS?" ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT THIS WOMAN? WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT SHE COULD SURVIVE IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR WEEKS. THEY LEARN FROM CHARLES BROWN THAT NELLIE WAS DILLON, MONTANA, GREW UP ON A RANCH OUT THERE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT SHE COULD SHOOT A RABBIT FROM 50 YARDS ON A RUN. SHE CAN BUILD A FIRE. SHE CAN SKIN A DEER. SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO SMOKED. SHE ENJOYED A DRINK. SHE HAD SEVERAL JOBS. SHE CERTAINLY DOESN'T FIT THE CONVENTIONAL WOMAN OF THE TIME. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN', CAPTAIN. MY BROTHER, WILLIAM, IS A GOOD MAN. HE'S A LAWYER. SHE THREATENED HIM. SHE SMASHED A BOTTLE OVER HIS HEAD. SHE EVEN DREW A GUN ON HIM. HE HAD TO WRESTLE IT OUT OF HER HANDS. I'M NOT SO SURPRISED THIS OTHER GENTLEMAN, ENDED UP THE WAY HE DID. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE WE CAN FIND HER? THEY HAD A FRIEND. HIS NAME WAS C-- CUDDY. HIS NAME WAS CUDDY. YEAH. CHARLES BROWN TELLS THE POLICE THAT HE THINKS HE KNOWS WHERE SHE IS. IT'S A PLACE CALLED THE CUDDY RANCH. IT WAS ABOUT 80 MILES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES, WHICH WAS THE WILD WEST AT THE TIME. THERE WAS NOTHING 80 MILES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES BESIDES MOUNTAINS AND PRAIRIE. IT TOOK 2 1/2 HOURS TO DRIVE 80 MILES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES OVER DIRT ROADS. THERE, YOU'RE COMING TO AN AREA THAT IS ESSENTIALLY LAWLESS. CUDDY'S RANCH IS THIS LITTLE CABIN IN THIS REMOTE AREA. THERE WERE MOUNTAINS AND RANCH LANDS THAT HADN'T EVEN BEEN REACHED BY ELECTRIC POWER. IT WAS A DARN GOOD PLACE TO HIDE FOR A COUNTRY GIRL LIKE NELLIE BECAUSE IF YOU WANDERED ONTO THE WRONG PERSON'S PROPERTY, YOU MIGHT NOT EVER BEEN HEARD FROM AGAIN. NOW, THE POLICE ARE ON HIGH ALERT BECAUSE CHARLES SAYS THAT SHE WAS CRACK SHOT. WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR NELLIE MADISON. HAVE YOU SEEN HER, BY CHANCE? NAH, HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN 6 MONTHS. NOW, LISTEN. I NEED YOU TO COOPERATE. THERE'S BEEN A MURDER, AND WE THINK MRS. MADISON WAS INVOLVED. MURDER? HAVEN'T SEEN HER? LOOKS LIKE THE CAR SHE'S BEEN DRIVING. THIRTY-TWOS. IT'S LIKE THE ONES THAT GOT ERIC MADISON IN THE BACK. LOOKS LIKE SHE HAD A CHANCE TO RELOAD TOO. MRS. MADISON. NELLIE MAY. JUST TELL US WHERE YOU ARE, AND NO ONE GETS HURT. WE KNOW YOU'RE HERE. NELLIE. NELLIE. NELLIE MAY. NELLIE. COME ON OUT, NOW. YOUR HUSBAND'S DEAD. YOU KILL HIM? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. WHERE'S THE PISTOL? AND THEY FIND A RECEIPT FOR A .32 CALIBER PISTOL. AND THE GUN WAS BOUGHT ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER. AFTER SEARCHING THE RANCH, THE POLICE DIDN'T TURN UP THE ACTUAL MURDER WEAPON. BUT THE RECEIPT FOR THE PISTOL AND THE AMMO, THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS PLENTY OF EVIDENCE, CIRCUMSTANTIAL OR NOT, FOR THEM TO ARREST NELLIE MADISON FOR MURDER. THE PRESS HAD BEEN HOT ON THE STORY WHEN IT WAS JUST MAN WITH FIVE BULLETS IN HIS BACK AND A MISSING WIFE. NOW THAT THERE WAS A CHANCE TO HEAR MORE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL AND POSSIBLY DEADLY NELLIE MADISON, THE PAPERS WERE ALL OVER IT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRESS AND THE POLICE WAS QUITE INTERESTING AT THAT TIME. AND REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS ALL SWEPT INTO THE INTERROGATION ROOM WITH NELLIE. YOUR HUSBAND'S DEAD, AND WE KNOW YOU WERE THE LAST ONE IN THAT ROOM. YOU SHOOT HIM? THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF HER. SHE'S NOT SUBMISSIVE IN THE FACE OF BEING QUESTIONED BY ALL THESE MEN. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. SO, YOU WERE MARRIED BEFORE TO WILLIAM BROWN? THAT'S RIGHT. WILLIAM BROWN IS A FORMER HUSBAND OF MINE. HOW MANY FORMER HUSBANDS DO YOU HAVE NOW? THREE. FOUR. MAYBE FIVE, I SUPPOSE. I WAS VERY YOUNG. THE FIRST WAS ANNULLED SO IT DOESN'T COUNT. SO IN THE EYES OF CHURCH, ANYWAY, ONLY THREE BEFORE MR. MADISON. SHE EXPLAINS THAT SHE RAN AWAY FROM HOME WHEN SHE WAS 13 WITH THIS FELON WHO IS ABOUT 10 YEARS OLDER THAN HER. AND THEN, THE -- THE MARRIAGE IS ANNULLED. WERE THEY ALL SO BAD? THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT. AT SOME POINT, WHY EVEN BOTHER WITH A WEDDING? WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. IN THEIR EYES, THE NUMBER OF MARRIAGES WAS ASTONISHING. AND THE FACT THAT SHE HAD NO CHILDREN FROM THOSE WAS SUSPICIOUS ALSO. AND DON'T YOU WANT CHILDREN? AND THEN, SHE DOES SOMETHING, WHICH AT THE TIME IS SIMPLY REMARKABLE. AND, NOW, I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PHONE CALL. I SHOULDN'T SAY ANY MORE UNTIL MY ATTORNEY IS WITH ME. IS SHE ALLOWED TO DO THAT? UM... I WAS MARRIED TO A LAWYER. I KNOW MY RIGHTS. BRING HER THE PHONE. 1934 IS MANY, MANY YEARS BEFORE MIRANDA RIGHTS. THANK YOU. AND TO DEMAND THAT SHE BE ABLE TO SEE A LAWYER BEFORE THEY QUESTIONED HER FURTHER WAS JUST HIGHLY UNUSUAL, ESPECIALLY FOR A WOMAN. THIS IS AN, AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED, ANOTHER RED FLAG. JOSEPH RYAN, ESQUIRE. AND SHE CALLED FOR A LAWYER WHO HAD BEEN ADVERTISING AROUND LOS ANGELES. IF THE POLICE WERE HOPING FOR A CONFESSION, NELLIE'S MANEUVER WITH THE LAWYER SHOWED THEM THAT SHE WASN'T GOING TO GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YA? I HAVE A RECEIPT FOR A WEAPON I BELIEVE WAS PURCHASED HERE. WOULD YOU MIND TAKING A LOOK? SO THEY KEPT BUILDING THEIR CASE AGAINST HER BY TRACKING DOWN THAT GUN PURCHASE. MRS. MADISON, RIGHT HERE. TAKE A LOOK. DO YOU REMEMBER HER? WELL, YES, SIR. YES, SIR. SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING ON A -- ON A HUNTING OR A SHOOTING TRIP WITH HER HUSBAND. THAT WILL DO. OKAY, GREAT. YOU CAN PICK IT UP TOMORROW. IN 1934, LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS A 24-HOUR WAITING PERIOD. MY HUSBAND AND I, WE'RE LEAVING FOR THE MOUNTAINS TONIGHT. I -- I'M SORRY, MA'AM. IT -- IT'S THE LAW. I'VE OWNED WEAPONS BEFORE, YOU UNDERSTAND. I -- I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I JU-- THERE'S REALLY NOTHING I CAN DO. PLEASE? THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. THERE MUST BE SOME WAY. SO YOU GAVE IT TO HER RIGHT THEN? BE STRAIGHT WITH ME. YES, SIR. I -- I GUESS I DID. SHE -- SHE SEEMED REAL NICE. SURE. EVERYTHING NELLIE DID MADE HER LOOK GUILTY AS SIN: FLEEING THE SCENE, THE TIMING OF HER BUYING A GUN, ASKING FOR A LAWYER. THANK YOU. HAVE A GOOD DAY. SO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DECIDED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF HER. AND, DESPITE THE FACT THAT NO WOMAN IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA HAD EVER SERVED A SENTENCE MORE SEVERE THAN LIFE IN PRISON, THE STATE WAS GOING TO ASK FOR THE DEATH PENALTY. FOR THE PRESS, THIS SORT OF A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE A FEMALE MURDER SUSPECT, BUT SHE'S ALSO MYSTERIOUS. SHE'S ENIGMATIC. SHE'S LIVED AN UNTRADITIONAL LIFE. SHE HAS NO CHILDREN. THEY CALLED HER THE SPHINX WOMAN, THE IRON MAIDEN, THE ENIGMA WOMAN. FOR THAT SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER, NELLIE MAY MADISON WAS THE BIGGEST NAME IN HOLLYWOOD, JUST AS FAMOUS AS ANY MOVIE STAR. AND WHEN HER TRIAL BEGAN, SHE LOOKED EVERY INCH THE PART, LIKE A CHARACTER FROM "THE MALTESE FALCON," THE MYSTERIOUS MURDERESS COME DOWN OFF THE SCREEN. SHE WAS THE COOL, QUIET, GOOD-LOOKING PULP FICTION FEMME FATALE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ERIC MADISON WAS CALLOUSLY SHOT IN THE BACK. SIX SHOTS WERE FIRED AT THIS DEFENSELESS MAN. AND HIS WIFE, MRS. NELLIE MAY MADISON, FLED THE SCENE AND THIS TERRIBLE DEED. THE PROSECUTORS BRING IN THE QUOTE, UNQUOTE DEATH BED, REMINDING THE JURY THAT THIS IS A CASE WHERE THE MAN MAY WELL HAVE BEEN DEFENSELESS. CALL THE FIRST WITNESS. YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENSE CALLS MRS. NELLIE MAY MADISON TO THE STAND. WE WERE ALL WAITING TO FINALLY HEAR AN EXPLANATION FROM THE SILENT SPHINX WOMAN. WHAT WAS NELLIE MADISON'S SECRET? MRS. MADISON, ON MARCH 24 OF THIS YEAR, DID YOU MURDER ERIC MADISON? I DID NOT. DID YOU SHOOT THIS MAN? I DID NOT. IS THIS MAN ERIC MADISON? IT IS NOT. WELL, HOW CAN YOU BE SURE? I KNOW MY HUSBAND. I BELIEVE HE'S OUT THERE, SOMEWHERE, ALIVE. ERIC MADISON IS, SOMEWHERE OUT THERE, ALIVE. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. I LOVED THE MOVIES. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. AND I THOUGHT I'D SEEN JUST ABOUT EVERY SURPRISE PLOT TWIST THERE WAS, BUT NONE TOPPED THE BOMB SHELL THAT NELLIE SPRUNG WHEN SHE INSISTED THAT ERIC MADISON WAS STILL ALIVE. NELLIE SAYS THAT THE PERSON FOUND DEAD ON THE FLOOR OF THE APARTMENT IS A STRANGER. AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT THERE. SO THIS IS MISTAKEN IDENTITY. IS THE MAN IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH ERIC MADISON? IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HIM. JOSEPH RYAN, THE DEFENSE LAWYER, HAD GOTTEN FIRED FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND HAD BECOME THE EQUIVALENT OF AN AMBULANCE CHASER. IS THIS ERIC MADISON? NO. AND HE SHOWED PICTURES OF THE BODY TO WITNESSES. ERIC MADISON HAD A MOLE ON HIS FACE, AND THAT MAN DOESN'T. PEOPLE WHO KNEW ERIC YEARS EARLIER... THAT IS NOT ERIC MADISON. JUDGE, AT THIS TIME, THE STATE CALLS GEORGIA MADISON TO THE STAND. GEORGIA MADISON IS ERIC'S EX-WIFE. MRS. MADISON, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU A PHOTOGRAPH. DO YOU RECOGNIZE THE MAN IN THAT PICTURE? YES. WHO IS THE MAN IN THAT PICTURE? ERIC MADISON. OBJECTION. OVERRULED. HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE THAT THAT IS ERIC MADISON? WE WERE MARRIED FOR YEARS. I THINK I SHOULD KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. AS A JUROR SITTING IN THIS CASE, ALL YOU'RE THINKING AT THAT POINT IS, NOT ONLY DID SHE KILL HER HUSBAND, NOW SHE'S WILLING TO LIE TO US BLATANTLY TO GET OUT OF IT. THERE'S DISCUSSION AROUND THE COURTHOUSE TO WHAT WAS RYAN DOING. HOW COULD HE HAVE PRESENTED SOMETHING THAT SO CLEARLY WAS NOT TRUE? HAS THE JURY REACHED A VERDICT? YES, WE HAVE. THE JURY FINDS THE DEFENDANT, NELLIE MAY MADISON, GUILTY OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE. THE STATE HAD ASKED FOR THE DEATH PENALTY AGAINST NELLIE BUT IT WAS STILL UP TO THE JURY TO DECIDE. IF THEY WANTED TO SPARE HER LIFE, THEY WOULD ANSWER THE JUDGE'S NEXT QUESTION WITH LIFE IN PRISON. IF THEY SAID NOTHING, WELL, THERE SILENCE WOULD SEAL HER FATE. AND DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATION FOR THE SENTENCE? SHE'S GONNA DIE FOR THIS CRIME. NELLIE'S DEATH SENTENCE WAS SO UNUSUAL, THERE WASN'T EVEN A PLACE IN THE WOMEN'S PRISON IN TEHACHAPI TO KEEP HER. THEY NEVER NEEDED AN ISOLATED LADIES'S DEATH ROW BEFORE NELLIE. SO THEY HAD TO PUT HER IN THE HOSPITAL WING. NELLIE WAS SCHEDULED FOR EXECUTION IN 3 MONTHS' TIME. SHE WAS DESPERATE TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN AND FAST. SO NELLIE HIRED A NEW, MORE RESPECTED ATTORNEY. AND TOGETHER, THEY GOT THE EAR OF THE ONE MEMBER OF THE PRESS WHO SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS STILL A LOT MORE TO NELLIE MADISON THAN MET THE EYE. CRIME REPORTER AGGIE UNDERWOOD BEGINS TO COME OUT AND VISIT HER AT THE PRISON. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THE TRUTH. I WANTED TO TELL THE TRUTH AT MY TRIAL BUT MY LAWYER WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, NELLIE? A WEEK BEFORE ERIC DIED, I CAME HOME... AND THERE WAS A GIRL. SHE SEES ERIC MADISON AND A TEENAGE PROSTITUTE ON THE BED TOGETHER. HE WAS ON HIS BACK AND SHE WAS LYING FACING HIS FEET, AN UNNATURAL POSITION. AND... THEY WERE BOTH USING THEIR MOUTHS ON EACH OTHER. NELLIE SAID THAT WHEN HIS DIRTY LITTLE SECRET, THAT HE HAD AN APPETITE FOR UNDERAGE GIRLS, WAS FINALLY EXPOSED THAT DAY, ANY VENEER OF KINDNESS FELL AWAY ALTOGETHER. TELL US WHAT HAPPENED, NELLIE. ERIC PROCEEDED TO TELL HER THAT THE PERSON THAT MARRIED THEM WAS A FRIEND OF HIS AND NOT A MINISTER. THAT HE FAKED THE WEDDING CEREMONY WITH HER. AND THE REASON THAT HE EVEN WAS WITH HER WAS FOR HER MONEY. SHE HAD $1,000 INHERITANCE FROM HER MOTHER. YOU'VE INSULTED ME FOR THE LAST TIME. I CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT TO. NELLIE SAID ERIC'S DRINKING BROUGHT OUT BURSTS OF VIOLENT ANGER. MY GOD. IT WAS AWFUL. WRITE THIS. AND AS PART OF HIS CONTROL OF NELLIE MAY MADISON, HE TOLD HER THAT, "YOU'RE GONNA SAY THAT YOU CHEATED ON ME." "DEAR ERIC, I'VE NEVER LOVED YOU..." HE MADE YOU WRITE SOME KIND OF FAKE CONFESSION? YES. NELLIE SAYS THAT ERIC FORCES HER TO WRITE A LETTER THAT SAYS IT WAS HER DECISION TO NOT BE MARRIED. THAT SHE'S A FORNICATOR, BASICALLY. "PLEASE FORGIVE ME, NELLIE MADISON." THIS WAS DEVASTATING. BACK AT THIS TIME, IF YOU WERE LIVING WITH SOMEONE WHO WASN'T YOUR HUSBAND, HAVING SEX WITH THEM, THIS COULD REALLY RUIN YOU AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY BE ARRESTED. AND THEN THE NEXT THING HE TOLD HER WAS THAT, "I'M GONNA KEEP THAT LETTER. AND IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT I SAY, THEN I'M GONNA DIVULGE THAT LETTER TO YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY." THIS WOULD HAVE DESTROYED HER. NELLIE MAY SAYS THAT SHE BECAME A CAPTIVE IN THE APARTMENT. ERIC DRINKS, ERIC BEATS HER, AND NELLIE STAYS. THE REASON SHE STAYS IS BECAUSE SHE WANTS THAT LETTER BACK. SO SHE LOOKS AND SHE LOOKS AND SHE LOOKS. SHE ENDURES THE DRINKING. SHE ENDURES THE BEATING. I COULD FEEL THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIM THAT CARED IF I WAS ALIVE. FROM THE TIME SHE WAS 13, SHE HAD FELT THE BURNING SHAME OF TRUSTING THE WRONG MEN, THE COLD JUDGMENT OF OTHERS. AND EACH TIME, SHE HAD PICKED HERSELF UP, VOWED TO ESCAPE HER PAST AND START OVER. BUT TO HAVE BEEN DUPED LIKE THIS, LIKE SHE HAD LEARNED NOTHING FROM ALL THOSE YEARS. SHE BECAME FIXATED ON THAT NOTE, THE PROOF OF HER SHAME. SHE WAS NOT GOING TO LET HIM WALK AWAY WITH IT. THIS'LL DO. YOU CAN PICK IT UP TOMORROW. PLEASE. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. HE WAS WILLING TO KILL ME. AND IF HE KEPT ME ALIVE, IT WAS SO HE COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN RUINING ME. NELLIE SAID SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT NIGHT... HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. EITHER ERIC WAS GOING TO KILL HER OR HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE WITH THAT LETTER AND TRY TO DESTROY THE LIFE SHE HAD BUILT FOR HERSELF. EITHER WAY, NELLIE WAS GOING TO STOP HIM. I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU LEAVE WITH THAT LETTER, ERIC. IN HIS DRUNKEN STATE, ERIC MADISON'S RESPONSE TO HER IS, "YOU PULL THAT GUN ON ME, I'M GONNA CUT YOUR HEART OUT." HE REACHED UNDER THE BED FOR A BOX OF KNIVES THAT WERE KEPT IN THE ROOM. SHE WENT THROUGH ALL OF HIS COAT POCKETS, AND SHE FOUND THE NOTE. MRS. MADISON, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT IN THERE? YES, MRS. BRADLEY. I'M FINE, THANK YOU. SHE TOOK THE NOTE UP TO CUDDY'S RANCH, AND SHE BURNED IT. AGGIE UNDERWOOD WAS NOBODY'S FOOL. SHE KNEW THE TIMING OF THESE REVELATIONS WAS AWFULLY CONVENIENT NOW THAT NELLIE WAS ON DEATH ROW. BUT AS A FEMALE JOURNALIST, AGGIE WAS ALSO FAMILIAR WITH BREAKING THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT PEOPLE EXPECTED OF HER. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL, NELLIE. AND SHE HAD SEEN FIRST-HAND HOW EASY IT WAS FOR A WOMAN'S VOICE TO GET LOST. AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE FIND OUT. SO SHE RAN NELLIE'S STORY, AND, BOY, DID IT MAKE SOME NOISE. NELLIE'S CONFESSION BRINGS IMMEDIATE PUBLIC REACTION. HER ATTORNEY SAYS THAT SHE NEVER TOLD HIM THOSE THINGS. THE POLICE AND THE PROSECUTORS THINK IT'S A FAIRY STORY. I HAVE TO ADMIT IT. WHEN I READ ABOUT NELLIE'S STORY, WITH TEENAGED HOOKERS AND FORCED CONFESSIONS, IT SOUNDED OUTLANDISH. COULD ERIC REALLY HAVE BEEN VIOLENTLY ABUSING NELLIE JUST DOWN THE HALL WITHOUT ANY OF US BEING THE WISER? NELLIE'S NEW LAWYER UNDERSTOOD PEOPLE WOULD BE SKEPTICAL OF HER WORD ALONE. SO HE SET OUT TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY PROOF TO BACK UP NELLIE'S CLAIMS. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. AND HE MANAGED TO FIND SOMEONE TO COME FORWARD AND SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT AND FROM A DIRECTION I WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED. OKAY. NOW, TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW. OKAY. NOW, TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW. I CAN TELL YOU PLENTY ABOUT THAT ****DAMN BASTARD. ERIC MADISON'S FIRST WIFE, GEORGIA, HAD TESTIFIED AT THE TRIAL. NELLIE'S OLD LAWYER DIDN'T THINK TO ASK WHAT ERIC HAD BEEN LIKE AS A HUSBAND, BUT HER NEW ONE DID. AND GEORGIA WAS HAPPY TO TALK. HE WAS A GOOD DANCER, BUT IT WAS ALL DOWNHILL FROM THERE: VIOLENT, MEAN, THOUGHT THE WHOLE WORLD WAS AGAINST HIM, BUT ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN. MORE THAN ONCE, I COULDN'T BREATH. SOMEONE WAS CHOKING ME. I WOKE UP, AND ERIC WOULD JUST LAUGH, SAY IT WAS A DREAM. BUT I HAD THE BRUISES ON MY THROAT IN THE MORNING. HE WAS JUST LOOKING TO GET MY MONEY AND THEN A DIVORCE, QUICK AS YOU PLEASE. HE INSISTED THIS FRIEND OF HIS MOVE INTO THE HOUSE AND TRIED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE WAS COMMITTING ADULTERY, WHILE HE WAS OUT MESSING AROUND EVERY NIGHT WITH TEENAGED GIRLS. BUT HE WANTED ME TO WRITE A CONFESSION. AND HE BEAT ME UNTIL I DID. THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN GEORGIA MADISON'S STORY AND WHAT WAS DONE TO NELLIE MAY MADISON IS REMARKABLE. ERIC MADISON USED THEM AND THEN GOT ADMISSIONS FROM THE WOMEN THAT THEY WERE THE DEFICIENT PARTY SO THAT HE COULD GET AWAY WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES. NELLIE DID KILL ERIC, YES. BUT WITH ALL THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES, DID THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME? SHE WAS STILL JUST WEEKS AWAY FROM THE GALLOWS. NOTHING HAD CHANGED THAT YET. PEOPLE START WRITING LETTERS TO THE GOVERNOR, BEGGING HIM TO REPRIEVE HER. YOU SHOULDN'T EXECUTE THIS WOMAN BECAUSE HER HUSBAND WAS AN ABUSER AND HER LAWYER WAS AN IDIOT. ERIC MADISON HAD USED A LETTER TO INTIMIDATE NELLIE, AND IT WAS LETTERS FROM THE PUBLIC THAT WERE THE BEST HOPE OF SAVING HER LIFE. BUT EVEN WITH ALL THE SUPPORT, THERE WAS JUST ONE OFFICIAL DECREE THAT SHE WAS WAITING FOR. AND IT FINALLY ARRIVED... A STAY OF EXECUTION FROM THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA HIMSELF. WITH, UM, 16 DAYS LEFT, BEFORE SHE WAS TO HANG. THE GOVERNOR COMMUTED HER SENTENCE TO LIFE IN PRISON. * DAYLIGHT SEEMS FULL OF CLOUDS AND RAIN * IT WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE TURNABOUT YOU EVER DID SEE. THE SAME PRESS THAT CALLED HER THE SPHINX WOMAN, NOW LED BY AGGIE UNDERWOOD, HAD TURNED INTO ADVOCATES FOR NELLIE. OTHER WOMEN HAD KILLED THEIR HUSBANDS BEFORE HER AND ONLY BEEN GIVEN LIFE IN PRISON. IT MADE ME WONDER WHY THEY HAD BEEN SO KEEN THAT SHE BE THE ONE TO GET THE DEATH PENALTY. AGGIE UNDERWOOD WROTE THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT NELLIE RECEIVED THE DEATH SENTENCE BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN MARRIED SO MANY TIMES AND HAD NO CHILDREN. ** SEVEN YEARS AFTER SHE'S BEEN CONVICTED, SHE'S ACTUALLY PAROLED. NELLIE GOT OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF WORLD WAR II. AND, IN AT LEAST ONE WAY, THE WORLD HAD CAUGHT UP WITH HER 'CAUSE ONE THING SHE'D ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT, HOLDING DOWN A JOB, WELL, NOW, THAT WAS A WOMAN'S PATRIOTIC DUTY. NELLIE CHANGED HER NAME AND GOT TO WORK, DETERMINED TO LEAVE THE SHADOW OF THE ENIGMA WOMAN BEHIND HER. EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER, SHE GOT MARRIED, AGAIN, TO A NICE FELLA. AND, THIS TIME, IT WAS GONNA STICK JUST FINE. * THEN UNTIL I GET ME SOMETHING ELSE * * SOMEBODY SOMETIMES * * WELL, I DON'T INTEND TO DO NOTHIN' * * FOR NOBODY * * NO TIME *
