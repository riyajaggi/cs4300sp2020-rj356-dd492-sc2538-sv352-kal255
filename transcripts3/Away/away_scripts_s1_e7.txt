 How can this be? Have you ever seen a dandelion grow through a crack in the cement? There's a Swedish study about children who thrive against all odds. They call them dandelion kids. Uh... My mother was a child psychologist. So you're saying there's no explanation? Maybe it's a miracle. Maybe the water rations have addled your brain. If this one plant makes it all the way to Mars... would that help you to grow your garden there? Unquestionably. I'd build my entire garden around it.

 Then should we attempt to account for how it has survived? Are you proposing an experiment, Doctor? If you are up for it, Doctor. Meanwhile, let's hope we're all as resilient as this one here. Dear Lex, how are you? Haven't heard from you in a few days. I wanna hear more about this Isaac. All you said about him in your... I told myself I'd miss things. But it's much harder than I ever imagined. Earth is so far away now, Lex. Just a dot, a tiny dot of light in the sky, which means you're farther away.

 I just wanna stay close to you. You okay? Think it was the 2:00 a.m. tacos? Oh. Ouch. Guess I can't interest you in that omelet now, huh? Want me to go get you something? A ginger ale? I wanna break up. Okay. I... I didn't know we were dating. Well, whatever we've been doing for the last... three months, I think we should stop. Do you mind if I ask why? It's interfering with my training. Well, that's funny since most of our non-dates have involved some form of running, swimming... Tequila, sex... My head's not clear. I'm off my game, and there's no room for that. Not if I wanna go to Mars. Not if I wanna be the best. Whoa, Em. Hey. Hey. Em, whoa. You are the best, okay? Hey, what's going on? Well, you... you don't get it. You know, you're a man. You get to do it all. Uh... Well, since when has being a woman ever slowed you down? Look, I... I don't... You're pregnant. I don't know. I'm late. I'm vo... vomiting. So, yeah. Yeah, I'm a little concerned. I see. All right. Look, I'm... I'm in this with you, okay? It's easy for you to be in this with me. You have a kid, you're a better astronaut. They move you up the list. Women move down the list. Look at Melissa. She was kicking ass, and now they won't even let her fly. Melissa... That was her choice. Exactly. There's no decision. I'm not giving up flying. Nice! Always look up. Look where you're going, not where you are. That was amazing! You're amazing. I wanna go again. Pro tip: switch to third in the air. That way, the clutch won't slow you down. Third in the air. Got it. The backup water system's been running strong for almost a month now. We got two months to go, and we all know that's a notoriously fickle system. There's a thousand things that could go wrong, obviously, and we've accounted for about half of them. What are we missing? My dad had triple bypass surgery last year. Right. Sorry. Uh... Sometimes I have a thought that's relevant, but I don't connect the dots. When my dad's artery got clogged up... You're saying if the DA goes down and contaminants get into some of the pipes... We can shut those systems down and reroute the flow. Jane, it's your system. What do you think? Sounds right. I'll draw up a procedure. Come in. Hey, Matt. Uh... Just seeing if you had that recommendation on the CO2 scrubbers. Oh yeah. It's right here. Should be a pretty simple procedure. A weekly vacuum should be fine. Here you go. Right. Thanks. I, um... I didn't know there was a meeting going on. It's not really a meeting. We were just talking about the... game... last night. Yeah. Uh... Can you guys believe we went into double OT? Right. Um... Sorry to interrupt. - Thanks for the report, Matt. - You got it. Look, that's very kind, but listen to me: no one needs to cover for me. You understand? If I get in trouble for overstepping my position, that's on me. If Ryan knew half the recommendations we're giving him were coming from you... I don't care. I'm not trying to undermine anyone. - I just wanna help. - You've done more than help. Sometimes it seems you have more up-to-date intel than Mission Control. How's that possible? Dear Matt, I've received proposed procedure for rerouting of the pipes. It's an excellent plan. All the best, Misha. Delete "All the best, Misha." I guess us engineers are not as compromised as they say. Winky-face emoji. Winky-face emoji. Winky-face emoji. All the best, Misha. Send. You ready for this psych eval? No. Well, it wasn't really a question, to be honest. So it's not insult enough that I have to sit all day in my room like in prison. Now I'm supposed to talk to you about my feelings? Everyone has to do one at the three-quarter mark, okay? Lu and Kwesi have just done theirs. The reason you're confined to your quarters is because a gravity-rich environment may slow your decline in vision, which we're all aware is a pretty big problem now. Okay, Dr. Mahatma Freud. Let's talk about my feelings. Right. How do I feel? How do I... Well, I'm frustrated... Because I'm going blind. I feel a little bit uncomfortable and very, very thirsty because my brilliant commander thinks she knows better than me how to fix the water system. You can't blame her for a compromised water system. Well, what a passionate defense of your commander. That's impressive. What does that mean? It must be so difficult for you - to keep objectivity when you... - No, no, no. What is that supposed to mean? Oh! I sense some anger. Would you like to lie on the couch? Tell me what that means. - I don't mind. I'll listen to you. - Will you two shut up? My head is pounding from all the screaming. And will one of you please fix the damn comms? That should be your first priority. - I'm sorry? - The comms? The comms. They're... they're down again. I just received an email from Ground a few minutes ago. The comms are working absolutely fine. No, I wrote to my daughter two hours ago, and I haven't heard back. Maybe she doesn't want to write back. That's... that's exactly how it started with my daughter. They pull away to protect themselves. The more we push, the more they pull. Best is just stop pushing. You know, accept it. - Wish I could learn this lesson. - Just fix the comms. I mean it. You're... you're a prodigy. You're really not just saying that? I'm really not. Although, I'd get some gear, prodigy, or your dad's gonna catch on to you. Yeah. I can't tell him how good it makes me feel. He just wouldn't get it. My mom did all sorts of wild stuff when she was young. Bungee jumping, diving off quarries... She flew a crop duster when she was 14. So, I mean, she really can't talk. Yeah, but when has that ever stopped parents from talking? I'm just saying, have an alibi ready. Dirt fight in math class? Yeah, okay. Maybe a better alibi than that. How about a garden gnome attack? You're a terrible liar. My dad's gonna be home soon. Okay. - Okay. - I'll call you later? Yeah? - Bye. - Bye. Emma, the idea with these evaluations is that you actually talk to me. You're a medic, not a shrink. And your mental health is as critical to this mission as your physical. And I'm responsible for monitoring both. Have you been taking your full water rations? Check the logs. I don't need to check. If you tell me you're taking them, I believe you. And how's your sleep? Sleep? I don't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I... You what? Nothing. Emma, I can't help you if you don't talk to me, okay? It's... stupid. Alexis has a boyfriend. And all I know about him is what Matt's told me. That he's two years older than her, rides motorbikes, and... his father was KIA. That's pretty rough. We're military. We know these kids. Your parent is killed in action, you're never the same. And you're worried she's connecting with him because... I'm not dead. I know that, Emma. I don't want her thinking about the possibility that I... Or hanging out with some boy who's gonna make her think about that. What does Matt say? I don't think he was thinking about being the go-to parent for boys. It's not like he's at full strength. And, you know, that's the other thing. Any time I've ever needed Matt, he's been there for me. And now he needs me more than he's ever needed anyone, and I'm not there. Emma, you can't... I'm not there for him. I'm not there for them. And my grade in calculus is up to a B-plus, which, I mean, frankly, I deserve a medal because there were two trick questions in that last exam that no one else got. Well, that's great. And I'm sorry I didn't get off work in time to pick you up. That's okay. Uh, Annie dropped me off. I saw Isaac driving away from the house. I'm sorry. I don't know why I lied. Were you out riding bikes with him? No. I swear I wasn't. You know, I don't even know if I believe you. You know how hard that is for me to say? Half the guys I was in rehab with are paralyzed from being on motorcycles. You are not to get on a goddamn motorbike. Do you understand? Yes. I promise. And write your mom back. I got three texts saying you haven't written back. I wrote her back, like, three days ago. And her last response to me was super weird. See what I mean? I mean, it doesn't even sound like her. She signed it "Commander Green." They're on water rations. She's exhausted. - Dad... - This is the toughest part of the journey. She needs us. Write her back, okay? Okay. Dear Mom, I'm sorry I didn't write back sooner. Okay, so you asked me about Isaac. Well... When I was little, you'd tell me about how you'd have to get up at 4:00 a.m. to spray the crops. But as soon as you got in that cockpit, the old crop duster, and it lifted up into the air, you got this rush of adrenaline. And it made you feel like anything was possible. And that was amazing because you grew up poor, and sometimes it felt like nothing was possible. But flying changed that. Well, that's kinda how I feel with Isaac. I was feeling sort of stuck and closed off, obsessing over you being away, or if I have Dad's CCM. But it's like... I can move now. Maybe I don't have to hold my breath for the next three years. Hey. Hi. - Come on in. - Thanks. All I have is this gross pregnancy tea, uh, but I can put on coffee. You can dish NASA gossip. I'm so out of touch. What's this? Scott made it. Isn't it great? He wants the baby girl to know she's from an astronaut family and her mom is going to Mars one day. You know, what I do have is orange juice. Goodnight, Mars. I grew up in Montana. Oh, Montana's gorgeous. Yeah. "Big Sky Country" is not just a slogan. "Stars like sprinkles." They used to say that when I was a kid. "Stars are sprinkles." My twelfth birthday, all I wanted was a telescope so I could see them up close, or at least up closer, but we were, um... Well, we had a farm, and my mom was barely making ends meet, so... She knew I wanted it so bad, so she saved up for months. I don't even know how. She got me this telescope that they had on sale at Walmart. I was so excited. I set it up on the porch facing south, followed all the instructions, and I... couldn't see a thing. It was a piece of crap. What's wrong? I'm pregnant. I'm not having it. Okay. I fought tooth and nail to get here. Why are you here, Emma? Because you're my friend. And I'm also your colleague, and I'm eight months pregnant. And I'm popping antacids like they're Tic Tacs, and... my feet don't fit in my shoes, but you don't find someone else to go talk to. You come to me... to tell me that you are not having a baby. So, what do you want from me? - I'm sorry. - My permission? No. Or did you come to see the cost up close? I mean, am I the cautionary tale? No. God... I just... I don't know what I want. Oh, honey. You've always known what you wanted, haven't you? This must be really hard for you. Hey, Emma Green in the house! What's cooking? Hey. - And how are my babies? - Hey. Hey, some guy came by with sod this morning. Yes. Kids need grass to play on, Mel. Yeah. Does Matt know? Hey, it's Matt. Sorry to bother you so late. Hey, it's Matt. Sorry to bother you so late. I just wanna let you know we'll have some new procedures to send you in the morning. I also want to check in about Emma. Her last few messages have been a little off. I'll be up for a while looking at schematics. If you're awake and can set my mind at ease, I'd appreciate it. Dear Matt, as always, please forgive typos. I guess dictation system doesn't appreciate my perfect American accent. To be honest, we are all a little run down here. As you know, space takes a heavy toll. But your Emma is... tough cookie, maybe even tougher than me, which, if asked, I will strongly deny. Smiley-face emoji. Smiley-face emoji. Smiley-face emoji. I think she'll be okay. But always feel free to get in touch with me. Okay? Good night, Matt. But flying changed that. That's kinda how I feel with Isaac. Stuck. I was feeling sort of stuck. But it's like I can move now. Maybe I don't have to hold my breath for the next three years. What you're proposing is preposterous. I ran a complete chemical analysis on the soil. Nothing is aberrant, which leaves just one hypothesis. Well, the notion that this plant spontaneously adapted to become more drought tolerant... It is the only remaining explanation. Yes, unless the explanation is... I... I really appreciate your receiving your PhD degree from "I Believe in Miracles" University! - Right... - You two need to get a room. Oh, this is science, Ram. Don't make it vile. Then make it interesting. Meaning what? Meaning, you have one theory, he has another... Put a wager on it. You still got half your Mars bar? You have... half a Mars bar? Yes, well, I was saving it for when we land. Okay, that's very literal, but if you don't believe in your theory enough to put that on the line, then... All right! Fine, but if I'm right, you have to believe that miracles do exist. Morning, Commander. How'd you sleep? You still checking up on me? I thought we finished my eval yesterday. See? Full rations, Doc. Good morning, space buddies. Misha is here! Misha, how many times did I tell you? You have to remain in your pod. No. What I need to do is vacuum the CO2 filters so that this fantastic crew can get enough oxygen to the brain and function on the highest level. Or is this also above my pay grade? It's above your pay grade now. You're no good to us compromised. Look, we can vacuum the filters, Misha. Oh, let him go blind if he wants. You know how many things I'm missing out on at home to sit here and listen to you tell Misha to go to his pod? He clearly doesn't give a shit about any of us. Go ahead and crack your little jokes. Risk our lives. Fine. Clean the filter. Take a goddamn spacewalk for all I care. I thought you gave her her psych eval. Look, she's under the same stress as all of us. Trust me, she can handle it. You sure? I don't need a psych eval to tell you what's wrong with her. I love my child as fiercely as Emma does. But I understand, if I ever received a call that... Lei Lei's fallen ill or... struck by a car... I cannot go home. I cannot hold him. I cannot lose focus on the task at hand. I accept that for the next three years, my husband is my son's parent. I'm not. Emma refuses to accept it... and we're seeing the cost. Hey, Matt. Hey, I thought we'd start today looking at the thermal pumps. Excellent. Hey, does it ever bum you out that we're basically brainstorming the hundreds of ways a water system could break down and your wife could die of thirst? 'Cause that would bum me out. - Would you mind getting us more coffee? - Yeah, totally. Or I could just go away for a while. - You want privacy, right? - Thanks. Dear Matt, last night I might have been overoptimistic. Emma starts to worry me too. Sorry. - You got a second? - Mmm. Matt! Hey. Finally taking me up on my offer? - What? - For you and me to have a session. Uh... No, I... We need to talk about Emma. I know Ram's technically doing the psych evals, but you and Emma still check in once a week over email, right? Any check-ins I have with Emma are confidential. I just wanna know if you've checked in with her recently. I'm sorry. I can't even tell you that. Okay. What about this conversation here? Is this confidential too? - Well, that depends. - On what? Are we having a session? Fine. Sure. - So this is off the record? - It is. I've been in direct communication with Misha in an effort to keep the water system online. Recently he expressed his concern to me about Emma's well-being. I wanna know if you share that concern. How's Alexis? What? How's she doing these days? I'm talking about Emma. So am I. The three-quarter mark is the hardest part of the journey. - I'm aware of that. - Yeah, exactly. You and I are aware of that. We have no idea how it feels. Emma's 20 million miles from the people she loves. I mean, I can talk about isolation, but that requires a different word altogether. She needs to know that her family is taken care of. I got it covered, Doc. - Do you? - Excuse me? After an injury, it is hard enough to take care of yourself. - Maybe for you. - Believe me, I know. And apparently, you're also doing the job of 30 engineers. What's your point? This might be a particularly difficult time for you to ask for help. All right. This session's over. - Door's always open, Matt. - Uh-huh. - Don't take the stairs. - Yeah! You're not riding today? No. My dad's definitely onto me, so... You want me to not? We could do something else. No, I really like it here. Thank you for being so open with me. I'm glad that Isaac makes you feel... alive. But boys this age, they're distractions. You have to keep your gaze ahead, in the direction you're going. It's all about where you're headed. You have to be careful. That's all I'm saying. Because there are things ahead of you in life that will mean so much more than flying, so much more than Isaac. Hey. I think I will. What... what's going on? Nothing. I'll just have a better alibi ready next time. Is everything all right? Yeah. I... I just don't wanna be responsible if your dad... You're not responsible for me. Hey. Hey. I can feel Lex slipping away. You know, she's keeping things from me. She's lying to me. I thought I was gonna be able to take on this whole role, but... clearly, I'm in way over my head. How would you feel about talking to her? Oh, of course. Yeah, whatever you and Emma need. And I'll also make it clear to Lex that, um, I'm not trying to replace her mom in any way. I'm sure Emma will be relieved to know, when it comes to boys, Lex isn't just stuck with me. Okay, you gotta stop doing that. What? You're not in over your head. Believe me. I married that dude. You're not it. You're the opposite of it. You know, for what it's worth... I always thought... Scott was an asshole. Okay. Yeah. Thanks for the heads-up. Appreciate that. Yeah, I'll never make that mistake again. Are you saying you're never gonna date again? I mean, I haven't in 15 years. Why start now? Cassie has this birthmark pattern on her back in the exact shape of Cassiopeia. It's five dots in a W. And Scott has it too. That's why we named her Cassie. Cassiopeia. She's his. They're connected, and he just... So... Yeah. No, I'm not interested in giving anyone else the opportunity to walk out on my kid. I get that. But remember... a lot of better men than Scott out there. And you deserve that. Mmm. Cheers to that. Lex, take it slow! Lex! Lex! What the hell was she doing on that damn bike? I mean, all we know is that she had an accident. She might be fine. She's fine. We're gonna get there, and... - Shit. - What? I'm Emma's crew support. I need to let her know what's happened. Uh... Melissa... She left explicit instructions when it comes to Lex. The second that something... No, we're not gonna send her a goddamn text message. It's the only option we have. No, it's not. Hey, it's Matt here. Good evening. I'm just getting dinner. Wouldn't like to compromise myself even further. Oh my God. What is it? - Emma's daughter's had an accident. - Oh no. What kind of accident? Hey, it's Matt here. I'm on my way to the hospital. Lex has been in a motorbike accident. I... I don't have any information yet, but Emma will wanna know. I think it's important that she should hear it from you. She trusts you, and I do too. I'll be in touch as soon as I have more information. Thanks. Matt. - You mustn't tell her. - Lu... I'm right about this. You just heard what he said. She deserves to know, Lu. To know what? That her daughter had an accident, and we know nothing else? How do you think she'll respond? Terribly. Exactly. Let's wait. Wait till we have more information. She isn't well right now. Matt doesn't know. He does. How? I told him. Lu... what you say about Emma not being a parent in space... Trust me, it comes with a price you don't wanna pay. - Emma deserves to know. - To know what? What's going on? As your commander, I need to know anything that may impact this mission. Alexis was in a motorbike accident. Matt's on his way to the hospital. He's gonna contact us when he has more information. We're here for you, Emma. Anything you need. I shouldn't have come. We don't know anything right now. I never should have come. I understand how you feel, Emma, but... I knew... I should have never come. I should be home. Ram. We need to discuss at least a temporary transfer of command. Emma is not fit, right now, to lead us. You're our second-in-command, so you need to come in. Lu is right, Ram. I can't. Uh... I... I just need to think. Oh, this is terrible. I can't even imagine what she's going through right now. I... I suppose we are none of us dandelions. What? I think I know why our plant has survived. Sir, I am so sorry. - Is she okay? - I don't know. They won't let me back there. I'm not family. Ma'am, I'm so sorry. Can you please just let me know if she's okay? If you're still here when we come back, if he doesn't kill you, I will. - She's all right? - Daddy? She has a slight concussion, but she'll be fine. Lexi? I'm so sorry. I can't believe I thought it had spontaneously adapted. No. Don't be too hard on yourself. I thought it was an act of God. Never once did two of the world's finest scientists consider... That even as Emma was exhibiting symptoms of dehydration... That this plant is alive because she's been watering it. Oh my God, Matt. I am so relieved to read this. We'll all be. I understand Misha filled you in on Emma's condition. Well... we've gotten to the bottom of it. She was using her water rations to feed one of Kwesi's plants. Please don't worry about her. She'll be better soon. Ram. Send. She's okay. I heard. I'm gonna have to administer a saline drip because you are severely dehydrated. No. I don't wanna waste what little saline we have. Lu and Kwesi have discovered you've been using your water rations on a plant. Your behavior's erratic. You're short-tempered, distracted, and your breathing... Look, Emma, I need you back. Not crying and upset all the time. You have a problem with my crying? My daughter is alive, my crew is on its last legs, and every decision I make, I pray I haven't killed us. The least destructive thing I can do is cry. Without tears? You're not making any tears, Emma. I'm sorry I missed it the first time around. I'm gonna administer the saline now. Here. Take this and keep yourself warm. It was the smallest amount. Well, a ration of a ration is still enough to cause a problem. I just felt so out of control when I couldn't fix the water system. And one of our main mission objectives is to prove that life can grow on Mars. I couldn't let us fail. That plant is our future. But it's also our past. It's Earth, and you couldn't let it go... or accept the fact that for the next three years of this mission, Matt is there for Alexis, and you can't be. Right. I used to be like you. When I was Lex's age. Single-focused. No one could get too close 'cause if they did... It might hold you back, right? I don't have it. I don't have what it takes to do this. To leave them. I wanna go back. All right. I'm gonna attach the bag. Just try not to move around too much. Matt said we should play you some Debussy. Helps you relax. You've been writing to Matt. Well... not really. It's Misha mainly. I think they're becoming pen pals. Mmm. Is it okay? What made you choose this one? I liked the name. "Rêverie." This piece... always makes me think of... some place I've never been. Thank you. Okay, listen. You... You try and sleep. Dearest Lex, I'm reading the letters I've sent you recently with incredible shame and regret. "It's no excuse, but I was ill. I'm better now, and I hope you can forgive me. Flight, possibility..." ...hope. These are things I never want you to live without. "What I wanted to say, but I did so very badly, is that there was a time when I thought flying was everything." When I thought Mars was everything. When I had no idea how much more there was. How much more there could be. Green! You're on the T-38. Confirming, you are not pregnant or experiencing nausea, dizziness, or any other condition that would put you at high risk in the case of an ejection. Lieutenant Commander Green, can you confirm? I don't wanna talk about it. I'm just sitting here. I wanna have the baby. Who knows? Maybe having a kid will make you an even better astronaut. No, it won't. Okay. Well, I can't say I'm entirely sorry. You're a real shithead, you know that? Yeah. I know.
