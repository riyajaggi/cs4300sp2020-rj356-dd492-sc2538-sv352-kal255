 For the fifth time since the shooting four days ago... ...a family spokesperson came forward to reassure the good people of Utah... ... that all is well with the stricken patriarch. After surgery on the 78-year-old polygamist... ...came a statement from the hospital suggesting, perhaps, "not so fast. " But on our No. 3 story of the Countdown, wait there 's more. A t the news conference, two hours before... ... the attorney general filed trusteeship papers in the Orlean Abbot matter... ... yet another wife came forward. -This is an opportunity... -Look, it' s Grandma. ... to come together for a good man.

 Our prophet was struck three times, point blank. Somebody wanted him dead. Someone even greater wants him alive. -He is that in.... -Just out of surgery again. No one will talk to me. And they won ' t put me through. They won't even acknowledge our flowers. One Rhonda Volmer also came forward professing love for the fallen patriarch. This a week after she had filed an abuse petition against same. After speaking to the off-duty officers.... -I know he's suffering. -Your father' s strong. He' ll make it. No matter what happens, he'll be okay. I promise I'll make us all safe. Thanks. There's a company I wanna buy that could protect us.

 Okay. The thing is it-- It involves gambling. Okay. If you say we need it, I trust you. I'm worried Barb won't be quite as understanding. So I'm really gonna need your help with her. You want me to work on Margie too? Gee, if you could. Hollis and Selma Greene were, quote, "Somewhere in Mexico. " The hapless duo, held over for questioning... ...entered day three of their hunger strike. And a shoutout here to Squeaky Fromme. -Sue? Come here. -What' s going on? I told Peg about Weber Gaming. She went ballistic. -She can't talk to Barb. -I told her that. Well, you can't tell them head-on. Gotta create an atmosphere for acceptance. I have to clean up everything around here. This better be an emergency. Did you know that they found out that holding anger causes cancer? This is more than anger. You recklessly revealed my business plans to Frank. Sold me down the river. Oh, add me to your pity parade. Your father duped me too. -He cleaned me out. -I'm sorry you're feeling guilty. Roman has been shot. The compound is in peril. A time like this is-- Is too big for us not to talk. No, it's not. Don't try and contact me again. Poor Nicki. I can't help but feel guilty about being here. I know but... ...Iife has to go on. Margie started her morning sickness. Thought it'd do you good to get out. Poor Roman. Oh, that's terrible. Wanted to get your advice on something. I'm interested in this new company. It's in the entertainment field. Entertainment? Yeah, it's like distributing video games. Oh, Bill. Those games are so violent. No, it's not like that, honey. It's more like cards. Poker. Poker? Video machines. People love them. If you think it's right. I can't wait for all the details. What do Nicki and Margie think? Well, I came to you first, of course. I'm here. Cinda's here. Adaleen's here. Alby's wife, Lura, is in the hall. You had surgery, honey. You have a fever and infections. Honey, no. Don't thrash your head like that. Oh, my God, he's bleeding. Doctor? Nurse? He's bleeding. Hurry. -What's my platelet count? -Let me take a look. He's tachycardic. Call the O.R., have them prep a room, stat. Mr. Grant? Mr. Grant. Honey, don't sing that song. Please, don't sing that song. Where's Albert? -Where is my son? -Parking. -I need him. -All right. -What's happening? -He's bleeding like a sieve. He'd slung a fever of 1 06. Do something, Albert. Do something. What? When? So, gentlemen, I've called this meeting to discuss the appointment... ...of an interim trustee to act in Roman's stead. An outsider? Someone independent avoids the appearance of politicking. Professional men. CPAs who do this for a living. Honest and confidential. Vested with what authority? Complete authority to fill the shoes of chairman, subject to board oversight. The UEB portfolio requires constant review. There's too much loose money floating around, unaccounted for. Incoming tithes need prompt investment. And a failure to act makes each of us liable for a wasting of corporate assets. None of you should be here. This meeting has no bearing without my father present. This is a closed session, Alby. You are trying to push us out. The UEB is a corporation not a Grant family domain. You are pushing our prophet into a cold grave... ...before he's even dead. You're not on this board. So you should leave. He is watching you all. Let's keep our heads and hold fast to what's best for the UEB. We're more than a corporation. We're a religion. Hi. I brought you an egg sandwich. Any news? He's in intensive care. Oh, I feel terrible for you. But I wanna share something with you. Bill told me this morning... ...he's thinking of some half-cock, new business venture. And I just don't feel that we're really ready for it. Well, if it makes us more money, why not? Well, when you hear the details, you probably won't feel that way. Barb? I mean, I don't mind that it's gambling, if that's the big thing. How did you know it was gambling? Bill told me. -When? -I don't remember. Yesterday or the day before. You're not always the first to know, Barb. I would never assume that I was. My father always said there's no sin in taking money from sinners. Nothing wrong with that, right? -Hey, Benny. -Hey. I'm taking over household shopping for Nicki for the duration. -Where are air filters? -The far wall behind Plumbing. -How are we on the dimmers, Ben? -We're good. -Margie? -Greg. -Hey. -It's been like-- Forever. Oh, hi. -So you look great. -Thanks. So do you. -I thought you left. -I did, not long after you quit. But then came back to the old store. Transferred over here a couple weeks ago. Floor supervisor. -You married? -Yes. I was married two years ago. He died not long ago. Oh, well, congratulations and sorry. Still have that blue sweater, you know? You know, I really have to go but it was so good to see you. Okay? Bye, Benny. Hey, Margie. -Diddly-do. -Diddly-do, Greg. How do you know Margene? She used to babysit me and my sisters. She ever give you a spanking? Everyone in Shipping was after her. But I got her. That's the best piece of ass I ever had. Really had something special. It's worth a second try. Ben? Ben. Margie? What are you doing here? A little shopping for Nicki. Did you get a chance to think about that company I told you about? Not really. -Well, has Nicki spoken to you about it? -No. -Barb? -No. Why? Margie, some people say gambling is bad but-- Well, gambling is bad. My aunt blew her whole pension and lost her house. But more people say it's just another form of entertainment. -So it's okay now? -No. I just wanna be clear that the company I'm interested in... ...isn't actually in gambling. It just makes the machines. So are you saying I should like it or not? You have a mind of your own. I'd never take that away. Oh, Bill. Just tell me what you want me to think about it. Well, Nicki liked it and that made me real happy. Okay. It's fine by me. If it's what we want, then it makes me happy. Margie? Thank you for shopping at Home Plus. I'm here to see my mother. SG2, SG2 to Wolf Pack. This is Wolf Pack. Go ahead, SG2. I've got Baby Bird 27 asking permission to see Mama Bird at the nest. Copy that. Please hold. Yeah, SG2, that's a 30-minute for Baby Bird 27. Roger that. What on God's green earth are you doing here? Hi, Mama. I brought you this freezer for the side porch. I bet you're swamped with casseroles and donated dishes. Put it back on the truck from whence it came. I don't have time for this. I'm just here for a quick change of clothes. I know this is a difficult time for all of us. For pity's sakes, Nicolette, this is no time to force a reunion down our throat. Your father almost bled out. We're exhausted. It's energy efficient. This is a tragedy you're trying to turn to your advantage? That is not true. I wanna help you. -I want you to let me support you. -I don't want support. Your father has a fever of 1 06. He has lCU psychosis and systemic infections... ...and all you can think about is yourself? -I'm leaving it anyway. -I don't want it. Do you hear me? Please, I have no one to grieve with. Well, then, let me see my sisters. -I'm still gonna leave the freezer. -Stop it. Go. Oh, I can't bear to be around you. You-- You-- You bring me nothing but heartache. What are you doing? Oh, I can't believe you. Hi, Gram. My directions okay? Yes. Come in. I'm sorry for tracking you down and imposing myself on you but.... Well, l-- I don't know that I have much time left... ...and I wanted to.... I wanted you to have this. It's made in America and has good pockets. What are you talking about? There's anarchy at the compound. Complete mayhem. Tell Daddy. He isn't speaking to me. -Why not? -I don't know. Your grandfather did something or said something. No-- No one's made it clear to me. But your father blames me. -That's not right. -No. Gram.... -Hello. -How was your run? -Who are you? -Gram, this is Scott. He's my friend and this is his apartment. My dad cut off my grandma. This is all I have left to give you. Frank ran off with everything I had. All my money. Just cleaned me out. I'm a victim too. -ls that your husband? -Yes. I mean, you're entitled to his support. What do you mean, "support"? Or, I mean, you can, you know, sue him for his assets. Utah's a community-property state. I mean, you own a piece of everything he's got. Do you want me to talk to Dad for you? I'm going to. I mean, this isn't right. Yes. If you wanted to put in a word for your old nana... ...I supposed that wouldn't hurt. Greg's your supervisor, Ben. We're lucky he's not more than just a little ticked off. What happened? What did he say? Nothing. It's no secret you're my son. I was talking to Margene. Greg came over and start talking too. I guess they know each other from the Murray store. After she left, Greg said some things about Margene... ...I thought were disrespectful. What about Margene? He was bragging about having dated her. It's okay, Ben. I know they dated. You do? Son, you don't have to protect me. I-- Well, Margene was an adult with a life of her own... ...before she came into the family. You need to go apologize to Greg. -You wanna know exactly what he said? -No. No. We ask our wives to handle their jealousies every day. The least we can do is return the favor. Go apologize. I will. You say it isn't gambling. Then what is it? It distributes video gaming machines... ...in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, ldaho and Nevada. -Nevada? -No, not just. Mormons in Las Vegas go hand in hand... -...and way back. -No, no, no. Don't change the subject. -Would you let him talk, Barb? -I'm sorry, Nicki. You're right. Maybe, I'm just being a little defensive being the last one to know. -No, that would be me. -No, not this time, sweetie. -You knew before me. -ls that true, Bill? In this time of distress and upheaval, I would think you'd be happy... ...that Bill would consider my feelings first. Or are you too busy mourning my father's failing health? -What does that mean? -I saw your clubs. Which stage of grief does golf come under? You went golfing? Barb. We all feel terrible, Nicki. I assure you. -Margie, would you please stop that? -She can't help it. When exactly were you thinking of getting this company? Soon. It's just on my list. -You've already got it, don't you? -Yes. You went ahead and bought it without even telling us? Yes, Margene. He's become quite the caveman, hasn't he? There wasn't time. I had to move fast. Nice, Bill. Acting like my opinion meant anything. Would you two just relax? It's my prerogative to make decisions affecting my ability to provide. Well, if Bill says we need this, then that's that. Remember, there's a patriarch above you. He's called our Heavenly Father. I don't think he looks kindly on you putting your wives and family in bed... ...with gangsters, guns and gambling. Look, hold your fire, okay? Tomorrow night. Just give me that. We'll all go see it together. Bad news from the National Zoo today, as beloved local fixture... ...Sung Sung the Panda died at the old age of 23. Sung Sung had been in captivity.... Honestly, who cares if a panda dies in a zoo? What'd you do with my freezer? -Freezer in my garage. What'd you do? -I borrowed it. Teenie said she saw you loading it into a truck and driving off. -I loaned it to my mother. -You didn't ask. Well, why should I ask? It came into this family before you did. -I have 50 pounds of hamburger in there. -lt was old. And your mom isn't even speaking to you. Go into the other room if you're gonna keep that up? -I'm pregnant. -You're making it impossible to grieve. All you're doing is puking all the time. My father was gunned down and my mother needed a freezer. You have to understand, there's nothing I wouldn't do to be a part of my family. Nothing. The genetically modified rat shuns food as well as sex. You'll notice the rat without the genetic mutation has a voracious appetite for.... -Hello? -Hello, Barbara. Since Bill refuses to speak to me... ... I thought I would alert you to something potentially troubling. What do you want, Lois? Someone ought to speak to Sarah about the company I've seen her keeping. She is skating out on to some very thin ice. If you have something to say about Sarah, you can be specific. Far be it from me to intrude into a family I have been written out of. Excuse me, Lois. If this is just a ploy-- For your information, her boyfriend's old enough to have a third wife. And if he hadn't gone and slung her a calf already, he's about to. Bill feels that he's respectful and mature. Does he? Well, then I guess I just don't know what I walked in on. What did you walk in on? What do you mean? Nothing. My son has my number. Mother? What are you doing here in the dark? It's all screwed up. All the check accounts, personal stashes, money markets. Your father would allocate it and get me the deposit slip. Now, I don't know what to do. Honey, please leave us. I can take care of this, Mother. We are vulnerable to our enemies. I believe in my heart... ...that Juniper Creek should be led by our family. I pray and pray for your father's recovery. Still, he needs someone to assist him in this hour of his need. Someone who can speak for him? Someone who can deliver his messages? Conduit for his revelations? Sarah? Hi. So your father told me... ...Scott was forthright and mature. He is. How mature? In years. Twenty-eight. -ls he divorced? -No, Mom. -Never been married. Twenty-eight? -Right. -Can I go now? -Yeah. -Was he brought up in the Church? -Yes, he was. Well, that's nice. He has a temple recommend? Mom, we met at an ex-Mormons support group meeting. -Ex-Mormon? -I checked it out. It wasn't for me. -You wanna be an ex-Mormon? -I was just questioning things. Well, honey, I know there's been some moral ambiguity in the houses. It's-- And there's been some compound influence. I don't see how we're all that different than the compound anyway. -You're asked to do the same thing. -Which is? Settle for less than you deserve. Are you having premarital sex? Just because Ben has overreactive hormones... ...does not mean Scott and I can't control ourselves. And Mormons don't have a monopoly on morality, Mom. -Hello? -Hey, Bill. It's Joey. -I thought I should give you the news. -What news? Mom was arrested. She broke into Dad's house and dislocated Nita's shoulder... ...and locked the wives in that panel room downstairs... ...and then she ransacked all Dad's records and papers. Crazy old woman. Has she lost her mind? The cops came and took her in, booked her, held her... ...and then released her on her own recognizance. I'm coming up for a UEB meeting tomorrow. I'll check with the cops. She's her own worst enemy. She needs tough love, Joey. -Pushing this trustee thing? -How'd you hear about that? Everyone's talking about it. I got a good half the board signed on already. Why are you taking such a strong interest in doing right by the UEB? I want to make sure you are protected. You didn 't have anything to do with the shooting? You were talking to the Greenes. The Greenes are trouble. This had nothing to do with me. Talk to you later. -Hello, Wayne. -Hi. I wanted to apologize for last night about the golfing. I want you to know I hurt for you, Nicki. I do. And I'm sorry that your father suffers. Well, thank you. Thank you. But I feel that your father treats you shabbily. And the way your mother treats you is a disgrace. You deserve better. You deserve more. There's something I need to say about last night too. You are pushing Bill too much, Barb. The man is the head of the house. We should lift him up, not try to control him. I appreciate that, Nicki, but we're not supposed to roll over. The men on Mount Rushmore are patriarchs. I want Bill to be godly. I've clipped articles about men having operations to enlarge their breasts... ...so their breast can produce milk and they can nurse. Is that what you want? No. I know how to submit and that's why I'm happy. Fine. But I don't feel that this gambling thing is anything we should embrace. I really don't. And we should have a say. And what we say collectively, as wives, should matter. If we don't want it, then it won't happen. -So you're for it, right? -I am. And you should be too. Barb's never gonna change her mind, is she? I doubt it. So if I say yes, then it's a yes. -And if I say no-- -Don't you go getting carried away. Come on, let's go see how the other half lives. Three cups of coffee, please. -We don't drink coffee. -Ninety dollars. And we certainly wouldn't pay $30 a cup if we did. It's not really for coffee. It's just a way to get credit so we can play the games. -What kind of games? -All kinds of games. I-26. There's bingo and there's poker and all sorts of great video games. I-1 7. This is a casino. This is illegal. It's not a casino, honey. It's a gaming center. Come on, Barb. It looks like fun. Well, now, I will make up my own mind, Nicki. Bingo. We have a bingo. Aren't these machines fantastic? G-46. -I don't know how to do it. -Well, I'll show you. -B-1 5 -No, I got it. Hold the pair. What does that mean? -Jehovah. -What? She's-- She's taking her clothes off. Margene, make her do it again. -It's poker. -We'll get rid of it if it's one of ours. She looks a little like you, Margie. Let's take a look at one over here. B-9. I-1 6. You wanna watch my cards? I gotta go to the can. O-62. N-43. B-1 5. -It's fun, huh? -B-3. I'm not so sure, Bill. Not so sure. Bill? Honestly, this place is cheesy. Let's just save the evening and go get an ice cream. Honey, it's just good, clean fun. All-American. I-21. -Bingo. -We have a winner. It's an insurance policy in an uncertain time. In an industry where people won't judge us for living the principle. What kind of standard is that? Then why don't we just start selling crack cocaine, Bill? It's a chance for us to start living out in the open. -So you said. -Barb, you saw those people. They would have no room to judge us if we were ever exposed. Very good point, Nicki. Very good point. How do you really feel about it, Margie? I don't know. What about Home Plus? What about the third store? It's been put on hold. Bill, I don't care if you own that company or not. If you can't get your wives behind it, you're giving it up. We will have a vote on this. Family home evening, tomorrow night. Everybody gets off the fence. That's it. -So how is everyone feeling today? -Just fine. That's the way we're gonna start. Everybody's just fine. So how about my beautiful guest over here? Rhonda Volmer, how are you today, young lady? I'm just fine. That's what we love to hear. I am gonna just jump right in here and ask: How did you become Roman Grant's child bride? Roman picked me right away from the joy book. -Joy book? -The happy book. Now, what is that? It's a book that the girls that are ready to live the principle are put in. Old Roman gets first dibs and he picked me, right off. God told him to. -What are--? Where are you, buddy? -Put me down, Dad. So were you able to--? -Where' s Wayne? -I ' m right here, Dad. -Who's seen Wayne? -I'm right here. I hear you, honey, but-- But I don't see him. Here you go, buddy. Eat your breakfast. I have to go up to Juniper Creek on that trustee business. I just hope that doesn't inflame tensions, Bill. Honey, it's a mess up there. Cash floating around unaccounted for. Tens of thousand in tithes just laying around that office. -And I don't trust Alby with it. -He's greedy, selfish. He only looks out for his own interests. He's nothing like Papa. -I can't even go up there. -I'll take care of it. Here I am, kicked out and banished while he's there. It's not fair. It's just not fair and Mama never sees his faults. Hey, I'll put in a good word with your mother. You're still with me, right? What about Margene? Her vote? Don't worry, Margene and l see eye to eye on most everything. I know how to talk to her. I'll see you guys tonight. -Bye, Dad. -Bye, buddy. We were told that everyone, besides us, was going to hell. I still believe it. Are you ready to start dating or is it too soon? It's too soon. Sorry, I was over in... ... Paints. So lightning strikes twice. That' s something. Lucky me. -I need to return these. Wrong size. -Yeah? No problem. We'll do anything the customer asks, Marge. I think it's disrespectful that you flirt with guys at my dad's store. -What? -I saw. With Greg. I wasn't flirting with Greg. Dad doesn't want you to shop at the store anymore. -He didn't tell me that. -How can he? Give him a break, Margie. It's super-humiliating. If being a priesthood holder means you can talk to me in a tone, forget it. How do you think Dad feels knowing you slept with guys? That's a long time ago and, frankly, none of your business. -Someone has to watch out for him. -Your father knows I dated other men. And he's fine with it. Are you, Ben? He's not fine knowing you were also into spanking them. -Hey. -That you're a big spanker. I'm so angry. So-- Just angry. Why? Bill says I can't shop at the store. Why? Because I dated someone from there. Well, this is what I mean about patriarchy. This is exactly it. And how. Bill trying to ram this new business down our throats. Even if the gambling business were a good thing... ...he has no right to force it on us. It isn't right, taking us for granted. It's not the kind of existence that we want for our family. Don't forget the children. Barb. We have to put our own needs aside and really square it away for the children. What's best for them. Think about it long and hard. You have a big choice, Margie. Hey. I know you'll make the right one. I'm doing this for their own good, whether they like it or not. Marriage is not a democracy. All the energy we spend letting them think they have a say... ...could light up Las Vegas for a month. You say this is a step forward. I see it as a step back. Back to living in the margins. Shadowy businesses. That's how I grew up: Check cashing, pawnshops, bail bonds. She'll get there. I don't know why I agreed to a vote in the first place. You love them and wanna be nice to them. You're not doing anyone a favor. If everyone's against us, are we gonna give it up? We're gonna do exactly as I say. -Yes. -Please, don't hang up. What do you want? Tell me Papa's okay. No one knows if he'll live or die. Or whether he'll survive your husband's attempts to usurp him. Bill is only acting in the interest of the UEB, Alby. He said, "Corporate decisions haven't been made." "Tithes deposited--" I don't know. Well, I'm gonna take care of it. You won't have to worry much longer. What are you gonna do? That's not for you to know. It might be... ...if you were to tell me. I could be of help. An extra set of eyes. The eyes of the world are upon us. All the networks and shows. CNN, 60 Minutes. Larry King will want to interview us. We're like the Kennedys. I'm gonna be called upon to serve the greater good... ...at a testimony meeting at 2:00. -Two o'clock. -I can count on your support? And everyone will be there? Hey, I thought you were gonna be at that meeting? It's been canceled. Something's going on. You know anything about a testimony meeting at 2? Just that, that they called a meeting this morning. Well, have they put out any news on Roman? No, nothing since yesterday, I don't think. So are you gonna invite me in? Yeah, sure. Are you guys putting some stuff in storage? It's Kathy's. She moved in yesterday. In what way? Well, Wanda and I are interested in her. Does this mean you received a testimony? No, Bill. I don't know. How did you know about Nicki? I mean, how can you separate your real feelings for her as opposed to... ...your gratitude for someone who is taking care of the wife you love? Well, it's hard, Joey. I'm just very fond of her. And Wanda is too. I think Kathy will be good for her. I'm not sure shacking up is the way to go here, Joey. I'm not ready to commit to a second wife yet and this is our chance to try it out. How do you commit to something like that... ...without knowing if it has a chance of working? -lf it's prescribed by the Holy Spirit-- -I understand that part of it. I do. But I'm just trying to be practical, not celestial. And I only have one roof. We can't all retreat to neutral houses if it doesn't work out. After this, we can toss the ball around. Both my husband and l went to the U as well. But it's a source of great pride to see how well the team's been doing. Mrs. Henrickson, I agreed to meet you because you said this was about Heather. Yes. I would like your permission to allow Heather to see Sarah again. But no, I think that Heather has been a tremendous influence on Sarah. One that Sarah could use. And one that I want in Sarah's life. My daughter's feelings about your lifestyle are the same as mine. -And they're not gonna change. -I know. I just want what we all want for our daughters. To marry a strong priesthood holder. My husband would be upset if he knew I wanted her to go to an LDS Church. But I want that for her too. I'll have to discuss it with my wife first. Oh, Christ. What is the matter with you? Terrorizing your sister-wives... ...Iocking them in a closet to ransack the place. What? So you could get arrested at Frank's for breaking in? Did you know your father was a partner in Witty Construction? -Listen to me. -He owned a janitorial supply company? -Dad? -A Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet? -No way. -The years I spent in so-called poverty. Me on food stamps. I just bet you didn't know. -I didn't. -I don't believe you. I bet the two of you rats were in cahoots. I found something else in your father's papers. Six thousand, five hundred dollars, from you to him. " For services rendered: marrying Lois." -You paid him to marry me. -That's what you wanted. Duped. Sold and delivered into the arms of that rotten man. You think I wanted you to marry him? What was in it for me? I'm getting a divorce. -No, you're not. -Yes, I am. -I paid good money for that marriage. -Tough luck. You said you wanted protection. -I did. But this legal marriage is a big racket. You don't even know what divorce entails. Yes, I do. I got a book with forms to fill out. Listen to me, you're acting crazy. You're acting completely irrational. You think I'm just a stupid, old woman. And you hate me. Jered and Josiah, together, smote the Lord. Roman and Romulus in a time of restoration. Albert Grant will act as interceder for the "one mighty and strong." During, before or after? During and after. -What did I say? -" During and after." This is true. By my own testimony earlier today, I saw his face. One moment it was my son. And then it turned into the prophet. And then into the face of Joseph Smith himself. -ls there a witness? -l... ...Martin Farris, witness of said testimony. I am not mighty. I am not worthy. I lead you only because my Father in heaven has asked this of me. I accept this burden in the service of you... ...my brothers and sisters. Before we take the vote, I just want you all to understand... ...what I'm talking about here. With Orlean Abbot's arrest, Roman's shooting, we-- We don't know what the future holds. We need this company. We need it now. No. I don't have faith that this is for us. I think the company is corrupt. And it can only have a corrupting influence on our family. We're under too much pressure as it is. We'll find something else. -Nick? -Yes. I don't think this company is necessarily any more corrupting to us... ...than living with sex and filth on television... ...and raunchy movies at the mall. And I'm not concerned with the values of the outside world. Someone else will profit from it. Why not us? Margie? I agree with Barb... ...that this is about our children. So I vote for it. Not for you, Bill. And it's not for you, Nicki. It's for our kids. Barb, you-- Your kids are almost grown up. But I have Aaron and Lester and a third baby on the way. If, for some reason, Home Plus wasn't there for us... ...I don't know what I would do. So I need the financial security that Bill says... ...Weber Gaming will give us for my kids. I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize, Margene. We're not gonna let this divide us. No, of course not. We'll be fine. We're in. Barb just needs some time. Don, I'm gonna have to call you right back. I just wanna clear up one thing with you. I don't know what Ben may have told you... ...but, Bill, I dated Greg a long, long time ago. And it didn't mean anything and I resent your judging me for it. Margie, what are you talking about? You don't want me to shop at Home Plus anymore? I never said that. You didn't? Margene, why would I get jealous over something that happened in the past... ...when, well, I have you for all of eternity? You need to talk to your son. By the way, the spanking thing was Greg's idea... ...and I never really even liked it that much. Sorry about that, Don. Listen, another thing. I think we need to transfer Greg Samuelson back to the first store. Well, I don't think he's gelling, personality-wise. And give him a bump so he doesn't think he did anything wrong. Enjoy your dinner. And not too big a bump. G-55. Just roll me, Debbie.
