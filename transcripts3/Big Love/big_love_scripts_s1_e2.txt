 Okay, and what else do you want? Mmm, this one. - Want breakfast? - Yeah. - What's going on? - No, this is good. Go take this to Sarah. Go inside and shut the door. Okay. Can you believe it? It's like a train whistle. What are they thinking? Teenie heard everything. Hi. Do you have an extra dozen eggs? Yeah. Boys, go into Barb's and wait for us there, okay? Go on.

 She wasn't like that in the old house. She was out in the annex and her windows were double-Paned. She's so loud. I mean, loud loud. This can't go on, Barb. Not like this. I've got a boner. You always got a boner. Just in the mornings. Well, it's God's gift to man. What time is it? Almost 9:00. When's for breakfast. It's a big boner. I'm hungry.

 Let's eat. You're a big boner. You're a perv. Mmm, you're my blue-eyed boy, aren't you? My little old blue-eyed boy. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's not discreet, invites problems. Well, I just want you to know I don't think it's right, either. I'm gonna talk to her. Nicki, no. You can't do that. Yes, I can. She can't help it, if she's too loud. Sarah, go make sure the boys have finished their milk. It's not just that she's loud. They should be over here by now. They know we're doing breakfast. It's disrespectful. You're right. Darn right I'm right. Good morning, Mrs. H., Nicki. - Good morning, Jason.  - Good morning. - Ben? - Yeah? Go put a shirt on. This isn't a nudist colony last time I checked. - Yes, mom. - And Sarah, no milk cartons on the table. - Do you want my bacon? - No, I don't. It's gross. Let's set the big table. Ben, help your sister. Teenie, go get your father and Margene, and tell them we're making breakfast here this morning. They should know it. And call up before you go upstairs, you understand? Nicki, do you want me to section the grapefruit for the boys? Yeah, thanks. That would help. And another thing-- this is your day. You have Bill tonight and our nights start at 9:00 a.m. We have to stand up for ourselves-- no excuses. Mom, the bacon's burning. Thank you, honey. This is your day, Barb. - Mom, they're coming. - Thank you. Come here, you. What? - Morning. - Hi, dad. Morning. Ah, food. Morning. Morning. What can I do? Feed your babies. Already did. Here, Ben, I'll take the baby. Honey, two pieces. Fine, fine. His good cholesterol's non-existent and his bad is off the chart. - Morning, dad. - Do you have whole curd? Good morning, Margie. Morning, Benny. Give me a hug, I'm cold! Margie? Margie. Margie! Margie! Yes? Can you help me out over here? Ben, did you hear the Jazz won? Yeah, double overtime. - Margie? - Mm-Hmm. Yes? Where did you get that? I've always had this. Half-Dressed? Ben is having a sleepover. It's just Jason. And Sarah and Teenie. Do you want them to think it's all right to run around dressed like that? Nope. Guess I wasn't thinking. Hey, so coach made me third baseman. Nice. I don't know how to tell her. She's acting like a child. Yes, she is. Maybe I'll talk to Bill. Uch, I hate those conversations. I'll talk to him. It'll be better coming from me. Thank you. You're welcome, Barb. That's cream cheese, I'm not eating it. Eagle gas. Mom? Who else would it be on a weekend? How's the pollen where you are? I just took a benadryl. Made me goofy. What's up? Has Roman spoken to you? That thief. About what? About me. About a business deal? A U.E.B. loan? Bet your father's involved. Another thief. He's on the priesthood council-- Den of thieves. So he hasn't? No. Well, has dad mentioned anything? Uh, I wouldn't know. - Haven't you spoken to him since-- - No. Well, don't you think you should? You wanna talk to him, be my guest. Have a love-fest. He gets out of the hospital tomorrow. Aren't you gonna pick him up? Me? Heck, no. Don't you wanna cover all your bases? He was poisoned, mom. - Who do you think he's gonna-- - Wait a minute. Whoa whoa whoa, now. What do you think? It-do-you think it-- You-you think it was me? - No, but I-- - It wasn't me. And I resent you even suggesting that. I just wanna protect you in case he suspects you. Well, how could he suspect me when I didn't do anything? That's crazy. Fine, fine. So who is gonna pick him up? Well, why don't you go pick him up? I hate him as much as you do. Then, maybe you did it. Do you know your brother's starting up a fish farm? Oh, mom? So what are you doing over here? What's gotten into you lately? I'm here on behalf of Barb. On behalf of Barb? I gotta get to the office for a meeting. Can it wait? No, it can't. You've been insensitive. It's not just that you've cut Barb's day-- night-short. I mean, we all know that happens, even on the best of schedules, but Bill... Marge... she screams like a tractor-trailer. How do you expect Barb to practice any self-control? Self-control? Barb is deeply upset... Deeply jealous. What about you? Me? Yeah. Are you jealous when Margie goes off like a tractor-trailer? I fight my jealousies and I conquer them. Well, I'm sorry. You can tell Barb that. Good, I will. That's a start. My little blue-eyed girl. My little blue-eyed girl, aren't you? Aren't you? I spoke to him. What'd he say? He understands. What's he going to do about it? He thinks you should call a meeting and let Margene know she has to stick to the schedule. The schedule? Or at least practice some self-control. Where's Wayne and Raymond? Nicki? - Hi. - Hi. Uh, do you need something? Where's Barb? She had a lunch. Brunch. I need your car. When? Now. I don't think it's such a good idea, honey. The engine started doing this ka-thunk, ka-thunk noise. Thank goodness, it's still under warranty. I need a car, Nicki. Barb asked me to shop for her tonight and I have this whole list of stuff and now I'm stuck. And I'm sure you'll work it out. Maybe you could call a cab. It's funny. I thought we shared everything. Hey. Thanks for coming in, Ronnie. Oh, only thing at home is saturday's a wonderful day. It's the day you get ready for Sabbath tomorrow. So, how did those store cams do for you? Everything I promised, right? Couldn't be happier. This is about something other than store security, though. Well, total confidentiality, always. I had an investor a few years back, made a loan. I've repaid the loan several times over, but still they want more. It's extortion. I'm no longer paying and I expect some sort of retribution. We can do bodyguards. We can do round-the-clock surveillance. If there's a risk of car bombings, anything-- No no no, I'm interested in protecting my family and my home, is all. We'll send someone out to the house, come up with a good system. Wanna tell me the guy's name? Roman Grant. Heard of Juniper Creek? Polygamy. You know, Bill, have you considered going to the police with this? These are tough customers. I appreciate that, but I'd just as soon keep it quiet. I'd just as soon they not know. Okay. Ronnie... There's one more thing. My house is three houses. What? Rentals? No, I live in all three houses. In all three? With my family. They're connected. All three houses? That's right. Big family. I see. I see. Yeah. Okay. We'll, uh-- we'll take care of it. I want my family protected, Ronnie, and I want the best. Income from Tithing. Last month's income from the Sunny K. Yes. Income from Intermountain Vending Machine Co. Yes. - Bee Hive Tool and Die. - Yes. - Copper Mine and Smelter. - Yes. Great Basin Coal Mine. Wha-what's the footnote? We're reckoning the 150,000 set aside for the NLRB for the miner's strike fund. No, claim it as an ordinary business expense and take it as a deduction instead. Okay. Henrickson Home Plus. Yes. Here on out, endorse any payments that come in "Accepted under protest" and put them in escrow. Keep our hands clean on it for now, till Papa decides how he wishes to proceed. What are you doing in town? Cancer Society, working on next month's survivors' walk. Can I come in? I try to be supportive of his ad, but he looks so silly in that cowboy hat. Just move that stuff. I brought home all the applications for the new bookkeeping position. Hate that part of the job-- always suspecting people, but one poison pill can bring the whole roof crashing down. This junk is gonna kill me. Jason and Ben had a nice sleepover. Where are Vernie and Jojo? They live at the mall these days. Those two-- bugs me. Sometimes I really do think I'm gonna blow my brains out. Nicki or Margie? Margie. Nicki's a trial, but it's Margie. She is so uninhibited. I was never that uninhibited, that immodest. You would not believe the robe she wore to breakfast. I am telling you, the hem only came up to here. Can't you talk to her about it? No. How? I got her to donate a big pile of them to the Red Cross last year after the tsunami, but she seems to have an endless supply. It's not funny. I've been driving around for like an hour and a half. It's like... I've been married to Bill 17 years, and I adore the comfort. I love my mature marriage. "Mature marriage." Oh, honey. I've been married to Don 27 years. And when he goes into the bathroom and shaves at night, it's uh-oh time, better click on the TV, try to distract him with a movie. That's mature marriage. You just-- you don't have to struggle with it the way I do. Oh, no? Don is a very sensuous man. And I have to work with him too. How do you think it feels to watch him walk the floor of Home Plus all day? He flirts. Since when? He denies it, but it's true. I keep telling you the antidepressants really do take the edge off. Barb, they are not addictive. What are you doing over here? I fell asleep. Where's Aaron and Lester? You shouldn't be over here napping. You've got your own house now. I don't like it at my house. You could fix it up. I got you those stools. I like it here. Everyone's always here. It's better than living on top of each other like we were before, isn't it? I guess. I need a car. What's wrong? Nothing. Can I have a car? Margie, three houses, four cars? I mean, look at these bills-- pediatrician, roofer, Utah electric. I saw you with Nicki. What? In our house, in my bedroom-- In my bedroom-- I saw you and it was my morning. It wasn't your morning. But it was my bedroom, and you used my words. You used my words in our bedroom. Margie. I don't mind sharing you, I like sharing you, I like us all together, but you can't use my words in our bed. That's sacred. Honey, hey. I love you and I respect you. Ultimately, you've gotta learn to trust me. Well, what you did was mean. Well, I'm truly sorry if you got your feelings hurt. No. You did something bad, you and Nicki, and you hurt my feelings. Margie. Well, you did. Fine. Fine. - Bill. - Barb, not now. Well, Nicki wouldn't let me use her car. And you had yours, and so the shopping did not get done. Well, okay. Come on. Going home. Yep, come on. Your health is returning. It's the blessing we've prayed for. Now, Harleen sent this along for you. Now, your lips are parched. A nice, slow sip. That's good. More-- take more. Now, that's good. Children-- how they make us proud and how they disappoint. Now, let's talk about Bill, Frank. How are things between the two of you these days? They're good. No... bad blood? Bill and me? Like that. Good. Glad to hear that. However, I have a message for you to give him. Tell him to shape up. Tell him to get back in line. And tell him he will not be welcome back on Compound Property until he does. Will you tell him that for me? I certainly will, Roman. And brother Roman, thank you so much. You bet. God bless you. I sure pray for you, continually. I surely do. And I for you. Thank you. Goodbye for now. Bye. Oh, there it is, honey. You know, I really like this one. I like that one. Needs paint. - We made it. - Hi. Hey, come in. This is the right place. Drive on! - Hey. Hello, darling. - Come on in now. Take that jacket off. - Margene, get those coats. - Okay. Jojo, the butter's on the stove and the oven's preheated to 350. My goodness. There's pretzels in here. Could you get me those napkins, Margie? Barb, what can I do to help? Um, just a minute. Nicki? Can you run those out? Sure. Marge? - They go from room to room... - Thanks. ...a supplier in each room, and they tell the supplier what they're willing to pay, take it or leave it. You see these suppliers buckling and bowing and scraping. - Can you imagine? - No. To be a Wal-Mart? If I had three wishes, it'd be to be Wal-Mart, to be Wal-Mart and to be Wal-Mart. Don? Thank you, Margene. It's exciting, taking them on. Mano a mano with Wal-Mart. Can do it. We can beat 'em. We can beat 'em here in Utah. Maybe Idaho, Arizona-- Thanks, honey. But Utah? Definitely. What color do you call that dress? Oh, it's... Just blue, I guess. That's pale blue I'd say, Margie. I think they call it aqua... Or, um, no, uh, turquoise. I don't know. Well, it suits you. It does. - I mean, here in Utah-- - It'd be a nice color for a car. Well, I'm not so sure about that. What do you think, Don? You think it'd make a good color for a car? Not a good color for a car, right? No, I don't think for a car, Marge. Sorry. Not for a car. I just think the war is wrong. And I don't care for this administration's foreign policy. 9/11, Barb. They attacked us first. And all I know is I've got two boys over there. What? You're not a democrat, are you, Barb? The war is still going on when Ben and Jason are 18. - Maybe I'll change my mind. - Make mine without cheese, please. Right now, we just have to support our troops. What's going on with Margie? Nothing. - Car bombing? - No, no. He-he said it as a for-instance. But they're coming here to the houses? Sending out his team. But gosh, Bill. They're coming here to do the houses? They're gonna know. Ronnie's discreet-- Partner with the secret service when air force one's in town. Look, I'm gonna run down there tomorrow and get a sense where things stand with Roman. Hey, Nick. We about ready? Give me and Don a sec. Talk business. Look. I'll know more tomorrow. I'm seeing someone. No? Is it serious? Peg knows. I haven't told Verna and Jojo. I wanted to make sure before I get everyone's hopes up. But we talked about it a month ago and all agreed it was time to add another wife to the family. Uh, she's a member of our congregation. You know, if you ever wanted to come and-- You guys aren't Juniper Creek, but I'm just not ready to go back to an organized group. Barb would have a fit. She still misses LDS. So, how long you been seeing this, uh-- - Betty? - Betty... Couple months. You put any thought into a fourth? I don't think it's in the cards for us. Not right now. Just handling these three-- It's a full-time job. Sometimes I wake up at 4:00 a.m. just thinking about all the responsibilities. You chose some toughies. You always gotta keep reminding 'em of the big picture. It's not easy staying on top of 'em, anticipating their needs. But they're the path you've chosen. You gotta pray for guidance and walk it with decency. - Stop. - What? It tickle? No. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, what? Hurt? Hurt? Hurt now? Ow! Did you have a girlfriend at your old high school? Yeah. I think you're lying. Guys, come on, okay? Dealt-one heart. One spade. How was Jason? He is such a gentleman. Is he still involved in scouting? Marge? Your bid. He's fascinated with emergency preparedness. He designed the evacuation plan for our house and had us all run drills. What badge is that? Star. Thank you, partner. He organized a first-aid station at jamboree last summer-- last july, in Virginia. Most of his troop is LDS. He'll learn what it means to be a saint. Nothing wrong with that. Long as they don't put the bishop on you. Last thing you wanna do is call attention. I don't know what to do. If you have six to eight points, one no. Eight to ten with a four card suit and honors, you can raise to two in that suit. Give it. I know you got it. Oh-ho. I'll never tell. Table talk, people. Marge, if you don't bid I'm going to scream. Um, three clubs? Wow, that's very good, Margie. Pass. Three no. - Pass. - Pass. - Double. - Redouble. That makes you the dummy again, Marge. Lay 'em down. What are you doing? You've got nothing. You can't jump shift with just four points. You indicated 16, Margie. It's just a game, people. What have you done to me? What do you think of Brynn? You're so out of control, is what I think. You need to slow down. And look, she's a senior. We're sophomores. She wants your manhood. She's after your bone, man. I think you need some serious guidance. CTR, man-- "Choose the right." Where'd Nicki run off to? Ooh, I don't know. Putting the boys down, I guess. I should go make sure that Sarah's holding up. - Barb? - Hmm? Can you ask Bill if I can have a car? I mean, I have a lot of errands and it's not the first time I've been strand and had to take that yellow van. I'll talk to him about it. Oh, thank you so much, Barb. - So. - Hmm? What's going on between you and Nicki? Nothing. Margie? If something is wrong with you, it's wrong with all of us. Now, if you wanna talk, I'd be happy to-- You need to talk to Ben. About what? About responsibility. Oh, you mean sex. I've had sex talks with him. Well, again then. His new girlfriend is apparently no saint in any sense of the word. She's kind of fast. How fast? This fast? I hope not. And I'm serious. Don't worry. I'll give him the deluxe talk. The "save yourself but oral is moral" talk. That was the '80s, Bill. Worked wonders on you, remember? "Oral is moral, baby." I was waiting for our night. - You were? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm gonna prove how much. Where are you going? I gotta get moving. I'm going to pick up my dad and take him back to the Compound. Oh, why on earth would you do that? I told my mom I'd do it. She called and I said I would. She's got the flu. I really enjoyed last night. Come here. I gotta go, Barb. I'm late. Oh, come on, baby. Oral is moral. You have to wear your shin guards, okay? Don't forget. Even though they're uncomfortable, I know, you'll be better off in the end, okay? Okay. - Bill? - Dad? Bill? Dad? Come on, boys. Mother? Wayne, take Raymond into the kitchen and watch TV, okay? Okay, mom. Come on, Raymond. You're late. What do you mean? Today is my night. Well, I'm aware of that, Nicki. No, it's 9:45, the day of my night and I told the boys that you would take them to soccer camp. Well, I thought we had to enroll them. We did enroll them and now they're going. I gotta take a rain check. I have some business. Bill, you promised. And it's not just me, although you did say you'd come over and look at my electrical system. I rewired from the circuit breaker to the meter and it still keeps blowing fuses. I told you, I'm taking care of all the electrical. Marge's toilets clogged. My toilet's fine. I plunged it. I'm gonna pick up my father and take him back to the compound. - I'll come with you. - I need to do this, just me. Okay, fine. - Nicki! - Boys. Time to go, come on! I want to watch the movie. Honey, don't let them upset you. I said now! Good morning, Margie. Morning. Nicki, good morning. Morning. Hypocrite. What I love about the church is how they urge you to go out into the community and volunteer. I volunteered at open door for six months. That's where gay, lesbian and transgender homeless teens can find help. You should come with me. Are these with or without? Without. You know, it's a really important organization. And they're so unpredictable. You never know what they're gonna say. It's really funny. Thank you very much. What exactly is "transgendered" exactly? It's when, uh... I don't know. A lot of people might think that I'm too mormon, too snooty to volunteer there, but I not. I'm very tolerant, I'm very open-minded and I'm totally understanding. Dad. What are you doing here? I'm here to take you home. - I don't need your help. - Tough, get dressed. - I got wives coming for me. - Call 'em and tell them not to. Well, they just brought me my lunch. Then eat it. - Are you closing tonight? - No. My aunt's coming to visit. She used to be real close, then she left the church and moved to California and caused a big rift at first, but she's still welcome in our house. You know what? Even when we don't approve of others' actions, I think that love is still unconditional. You are so determined. What? You overheard something last week. We both know it. You've been fishing ever since, sending signals, one after the other. Look, I'm a polygamist. My parents are. So what? I was just trying to let you know that I knew. I didn't want to be rude. Well, now it's official. So what are you gonna do, rat me out to your state trooper father? Probably! You know, 'cause I tell him everything. Why does everyone think I don't have a sense of humor? Look. I don't care what your parents do. I just wanna be friends, okay? We need a fishwich. Okay.  I should tell you, I don't agree with, uh-- polygamy. Yeah, well, guess what? Neither do I. Yeah? Yeah. - Okay. - Hello. Fishwich. Dig your own grave. So it's not the milk of human kindness that brung you down here. Nope. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't dead, didn't you? Not really. You know something? I always knew... you'd be the success. Something about the old dark horse. That was you.  Football and Joey-- loser, flash in the pan-- but not you. Money, business-- Now we're talking. You still on the priesthood council? - Oh, yeah.  - Talked to Roman? Now, you got something going with Roman? Nothing I don't have under control. Well, that's good. But if it wasn't quite as under control as you say, I could be a help maybe. I could be useful. You know, Roman and I have a long relationship. Goes back a long way, you know what I mean? He tells me everything. Wouldn't cost you much. I don't know-- 5,000. You trying to shake me down? You old fool, I came out here 'cause you almost died, 'cause your old buddy Roman tried to do you in. Thought it was my responsibility to warn you. - Roman? Please. - Come on, hurry up. So we both think that your mother did it. What? Oh, come on. You feel the same way I do. She has me come over there to fix her chainsaw, lures me into the rat trap she has the guts to call a house, feeds me that soup. You saw me a week later. I was lucky to get out of there alive. You know something? You ought to thank me for your successes, because if I hadn't have pushed you out there in-- - Pushed me out? - Yeah. You threw me out like I was garbage! Had me get in the back of the pick-up, drove me into the city, told me to get out. Yeah. Fend for myself? I was 14 years old. What do you think I did? What do you think I had to do? If you think I'd ever thank you for anything but shame and heartache-- What are you waiting for, an apology? That's the way it is. Young boys get run off. Old men get all the pretty girls. That's the way it is, bud. You lacked the decency to even give me your name. - Oh, please. - Oh, what am I doing?! The sooner you're out of my hair, the better! - I'm not getting in that. - Get in. I'm not get-- Oh, come on. That's my dessert. Let's go. You hungry? I'll take you to mom. I am hungry. - She'll feed you some of her soup. - I'm not going to her house. - Let's get some soup. I- - Come on, I control her. - You don't control anybody. - Oh, I do too. - You don't control her. - Oh, watch me. - You don't control anybody! - Oh, really? You watch-- You watch your back. - You better watch your back. - Watch your back. We're never too far apart when we're holding hands. All right. Bill is sitting down with the seller's agent tomorrow. He's gonna present our final list of all undisclosed problems. Hopefully, there'll be an adjustment without a lawsuit. I need your lists. Oh, darn. What's eating you? You know. No, I don't. Yes, you do. You slept with Bill in my bed. No, I didn't. Yes, you did, Nicki. I saw you. Shh, lower your voice. If Barb hears you talking, it'll upset her. - It's wrong, what you did. - Shh, would you stop? I want you to admit it. Admit it. All right. Where were we? You wanted a list of problems with each house. Right, Marge? See, and I don't like it when you talk to me like that, either. Like what? Never mind. You know, I have something I wanna say. I wanna say that we have a schedule, and we have the schedule because we need the schedule. Um, what do you want us to know by saying that, Margie? That Nicki slept with Bill in my bed-- yesterday. Nicki, is that true? I don't know what she's talking about. Oh, yes, you do and you know it! Well, I'm sorry, okay? It just happened! And you wanna know the truth? It all started because you are so darn loud. That is so not true! Actually, Margie, it is true, but, Nicki, what were you thinking? Well, it's not like you're so innocent in all this, boss lady. And I said I was sorry, okay? I don't see why we have to keep harping on it. I'm done talking about it. We're here to talk about home repairs, and I brought my list. You got Alby after you, you got Roman after you. I think I'll, uh... hoof it on home from here. You gather my meaning. Thanks for the lift. Say hello to your dad. Heavenly father, thank you for the clear roads driving home, but I'm lost. Guide me. Guide me back to the path of your righteousness. You are my father. Show me the way, father. Show me the way. In the name of Jesus Christ, help me. Amen. Bill? Honey? I've been thinking about you. We are links to eternity. Ahead of us, family yet to come, souls to be born. Behind us, ancestors-- ancestors who sacrificed. We are making those sacrifices to live the principle, to keep faith. Margie, you are a valued member of this family. We weren't complete, not until you. You made us complete. I wasn't complete until you and our fine sons. What happened was a mistake. It'll never happen again, all right? All right? I gotta get. But I still need a car. Hey, mom. What on earth did you do to him? What did I do? I picked him up at the hospital, is all. What did you say? To tell you the truth, mom, it's been a long day. I can't remember what I said. - I tried to tell him that-- - It was me who poisoned him? - No. - Well, that's what he told me. He told me you said I did it. - Ma, I said no-- I did no such thing. - Told him to watch his back around me. "Watch your back." What have you done? He says he's gonna kill me. - That is what he said. - Mom, mom, mom, mom, calm down. Me calm down? Yeah, we'll work this out. - Easy for you to say, traitor. - Mom! Bill? Bill, come to bed. Bill? I'm coming.
