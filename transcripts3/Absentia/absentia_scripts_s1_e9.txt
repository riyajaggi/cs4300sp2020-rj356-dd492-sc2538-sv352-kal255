 I'm Agent Nick Durand, I need to speak with one of your patients, Charles Avallone. - Who is B? - Please, the book! Don't move! Don't make me do this. Nick, Nick, Nick. Hey, man, what happened? - OK. Go. Go get her. - What? Who? - Emily. Emily, she... - Where? There... there! Fucking go! What the hell? Watch it! Hey, watch where you're going! I'm sorry.

Please, listen to me... Don't hurt Flynn, please. I'll do anything. Don't you touch him, you lunatic! Do you hear me? You leave him alone! You want to hurt someone, you hurt me! Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, we will be making an emergency stop at the next station. Sorry for the inconvenience. Hey. You're gonna want to hold on, OK? You OK? - You got her? - No. - Thanks. - Yeah, sir. She shot me. I know. Lucky you. It's not luck... It's mandatory for the field. Emily knows that? She... she knows we're onto her. She's trying to slow us down, to... keep us from finding Alice and Flynn. You being dead would have slowed us down a lot more. No, no. You stopped... You stopped to help. And dead men don't need first aid. Jesus. She's always two steps ahead. All right, we got it covered. I'm gonna talk to Charles Avallone to see why Emily came all the way out here, all right? No, no, no. I'm coming. I'm coming. - What are you doing? - I'm coming with, man. We never wanted... We never wanted. We... - No, no, no! Mr. Avallone is in. - No, we need... - no condition to answer any questions. - We need to speak to with Mr. Avallone. Yeah, because clearly you sedated him. He was extremely agitated. That woman attacked him, and he was far from stable to begin with. This, royal "we" stuff, is he completely delusional, or...? Charles has an adaptive fantasy, - an imaginary friend. - Yeah, well, we aren't so sure, you know. Charles' friend might be real after all. Hey, look, look. The woman... who attacked Charles is named Emily Byrne. She's wanted for multiple homicide, and she's kidnapped my wife and my son. He may know something that could help us find them. He and Emily grew up together in state care, at Barrett House. But Charles has been here at Edgewater, for more than 10 years, - I don't know how... - I'm sorry, I don't have time for this. - Hey... hey, hey! - Why else... why else - would Emily come all this way? - Hey, hey. Relax, man. Let me handle this. Okay? Sorry, it's Um... this guy, Doctor Shen, MIT scientist, he was, um... experimenting on kids at Barrett House. We've listened to his tapes, interviews with... with the subjects. Um, Charles was one of them, and there was at least, one other kid. And you think that child, - is Charles' imaginary friend? - Yes. Subject B. Charles was, Subject A. Okay, he needs time to recover. - How much time? - Well, come back tomorrow. We don't... we don't have a day. We may not even have hours. Shen ended up in a grave with five other bodies, eyelids cut off. That's the signature of Conrad Harlow, a known... serial killer. Now, I've looked at who pays the bills - for Charles here at Edgewater... - That's a family trust. It's been that way since the beginning. Are you aware that this trust is, linked with Conrad Harlow? Your Subject B, you think it's Emily Byrne and you need Charles to confirm that, right? Yes. I just... II just wanna find my family. Housekeeping. Housekeeping. Hey! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Hey! Stop that woman! Grab her! Stop her! Hey, stop! Ma'am! She locked the door! Shit! - There she is! - Hey! Stop! - Dios mío. - Stop! Don't move! Don't move! Get up! Open the door! Now, come here! Get over there! Come on, let's go! Go, go, go! Hurry up! In! Now, now, move, move. You too, honey. Goddammit, get over here. Don't move. Don't move. - Em, talk to me. - Hey. I found a company called "TriKing". They make, tanks and aquariums. I need you to track 'em down. What do they have to do with whoever has Flynn? I think they made the tank that held me. I need to find out who ordered it and where it was sent. Okay. TriKing. I'm on it. Okay. There's a switch! Switch! Let's go. Mom! No! Mom! Mom! Maybe we should call it a night? You saw Captain Spaceman over there. I don't think we're gonna get anything out of him. - That's Crown. - Yeah. - Yeah? - We got results on the bodies. Two names you know: Belson and Drummond, two of Harlow's first victims. The others are in advanced decomp, Whitman says fifteen years. Wait, wait, wait, where was Harlow back then? That's the problem. Conrad Harlow was in Zurich from 2000 to 2005, at least according to his passport. We need to see if he had any known associates back then. Way ahead of you. Ericson tracked down an old girlfriend of Harlow's from grad school. She filed a sexual assault charge with campus police. - It mentions two attackers. - Any names? The file was buried by the DA. I'm gonna interview the girlfriend now. All good. And we're waiting on Charles. - This is gonna be fun. - Actually, we're about to visit with him. Call you later. We wanted to talk to you about the woman who, came visit you, today. - No. - Wait, wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Charles. Okay, no... no problem, no problem. Hey, buddy, buddy. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. - Hey. Sorry, buddy. Sorry. - It's okay. How about we talk about your, your friend? Charles, sounds like you two were close. Yeah, we take care of each other. Did you, um... It's okay. It's okay. You keep each other's secrets? Sometimes. - Yeah? - Yeah. I have a friend like that. A friend who I keep secrets for. What kind of secrets? Sometimes... my friend isn't very nice. Sometimes, she's... she's kind of mean. Yeah, my friend is kind of mean too. - Yeah. - To other people? - Yeah? - Yeah. To you? Hey, it's okay. That's hard. It's hard when you care about someone who's mean. Yeah. Did your friend ever get angry with Dr. Shen? We don't wanna talk about that. - Did Dr. Shen hurt you? - Yeah. Your friend? Did your friend hurt Dr. Shen back? I'm not supposed to say. I'm not supposed to say. Maybe we should... we could check on him, make sure he's okay. I don't care if he's hurt. He hurt us first. Well, then, we... we should find him and lock him up. Yeah. Yeah, well, make sure he never hurts anyone else again. He hurt so many... so many children. Wwas... was there candy in the air when they got hurt? - And I said something about that. - Yeah, yeah. That's how Dr. Shen tricks you. "Thethethe air is fullfull of candy.'" And I tried to eat it. And... and he lies. He always says you can have the candy later, but, there wasn't any candy. - There was never any candy. - It's okay, Charles. - It's okay. That's enough. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - No, no, no, it's okay. - No, that's enough. It's okay. It's okay. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. What are you doing, man? He was starting to talk. I know. I know. I know. But I think we got what we needed. - Do you remember the molasses flood? - That urban legend? Well, it's not an urban legend. 100 years ago... a storage tank exploded and flooded the North End with 2 million gallons of molasses. The North End doesn't smell like molasses. No, not so much anymore. But back in the 1990's... when they ripped everything up from the big dig, it did. After the explosion, the factory turned into a warehouse. - Perfect for torturing kids. - Yeah. Or holding my family. Hey. What did you find? Do you know I could go to jail for helping her like this? Yeah, don't worry, you'll get your exclusive. What I found is better than that. Look, Jack, I do want that interview, but I can't sit on this. I mean, I can give you... half a day maybe, but then I publish. What do you mean? Sit on what, Laurie? What the hell did you find? Hey. You find anything? - I did. But, Em... - What? Just say it, Jack. TriKing made the tank 7 years ago, - they had it delivered to the North End. - Okay, where? 978 Commercial Street. Suite 209. And who ordered it? Jack? You did, Em. It was you. No, that's not possible. I saw the invoice myself. You signed it. It's forged. I'm going there. And I'm gonna find Flynn. Thank you. Some things are better left in the past. There are lives at stake in the present, Ms. Wheelock. You never know what might help. We were young people experimenting. Things got out of hand. That's not what you put in the record you filed. - The Harlows were a powerful family. - Not anymore. You can talk to me. Conrad and I had broken up a year before. It was amicable. Then we bumped into each other, made plans for a drink. We were back at his place, he had a friend join us. Then... I blacked out. It's only images. This friend... I need a name. Harlow may have had an accomplice in his murders. He wasn't always some monster. Conrad I knew, before that night... he was sensitive. He was in pain. Something hurt him. What? He'd never say. Something in his family. I still need the name of the other man who assaulted you. Who said it was a man? Survive. There's nothing here. What? What is it? Nick? Durand! That's the mask Emily drew. No eyelids. The children Shen held in those rooms would have seen this. It's not Harlow. The children who saw these masks had the idea way before Harlow ever got involved. Jesus! I've had it wrong since the beginning. Since he called me that night. Emily's not Harlow's accomplice... but she could be his mentor. Durand. Nick, I'm over from the cabin. I was sent here by whoever has them. They're underground. - Emily, stay there. - No, Nick. Listen. Whoever planned this has eyes. If they see an army coming Flynn will die, Alice will die... I need you to come alone. You can cuff me after, I don't care. You have my word. Okay. I'll come alone. Okay, I'm about 200 meters north of the cabin. There's an open tunnel. I'll leave you my scarf as a sign. Transcribed & synced by kinglouisxx & chamallow. Proofreading by PetaG for www.addic7ed.com
