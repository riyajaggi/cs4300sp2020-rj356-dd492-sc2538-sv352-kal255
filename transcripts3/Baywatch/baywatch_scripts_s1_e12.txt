 [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [CAROUSEL MUSIC] BIDDLE: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'D LIKE YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME RIGHT NOW. IMAGINE THE BEACH WITHOUT THE PIER. WITHOUT THE HOT DOGS, SKEE BALL, AND MERRY-GO-ROUND. MY FAMILY, LIKE THE REST OF THE MERCHANTS HERE, HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PIER SINCE IT OPENED IN 1939. YOU'RE STANDING ON 50 YEARS OF HARD WORK AND FOND MEMORIES. -NOT TO MENTION CORRODED PLANKS AND BATTERED PILINGS. BIDDLE: BUT IF WE DON'T RAISE ANOTHER $50,000 DOLLARS BEFORE MIDNIGHT SUNDAY, THOSE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WILL ALL LAY DOWN THEIR HAMMERS-- -YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH SAVING? -I DON'T CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. I GET PAID NO MATTER WHAT, BUT I'D RATHER IT GOES 'CAUSE OF MY WRECKING BALL, AND NOT SOME WHACKO STUNT WITH AN ARMORED CAR. -I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT A FAN. -I WOULDN'T PARK A 20,000-POUND ARMORED CAR HERE. -WE'VE RAISED 100,000 DOLLARS SO FAR, WHICH YOU CAN SEE ALL WEEKEND IN THE ARMORED CAR. -I GOT ONE OF MY GUYS UNDER THE PIER. HE'S CHECKING THINGS OUT RIGHT NOW. -INCLUDING THE FIVE BUCKS YOU PAY TO HAVE YOUR PICTURE TAKEN WITH THE MONEY. SO REACH DEEP IN YOUR POCKETS AND HELP OUT AN OLD FRIEND, THE BEACHFRONT PIER. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. -THIS IS GOING TO BE A TERRIFIC PICTURE. I LOOK GREAT SURROUNDED BY MONEY. -DON'T WE ALL? -I DON'T GET IT, MITCH.

SHAUNI: BUT YOU DON'T WANNA BE WITH ME. -YOU DON'T? BUTT OUT. SHAUNI, LOOK, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY NOT WANTING TO BE WITH YOU. -THEN WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH? -IT HAS TO DO WITH GUYS.

ARE YOU, UH, HAPPY THAT YOU CAME OUT WITH ME TONIGHT OR NOT? -AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO BE ANGRY, I AM GLAD I CAME. -ME TOO. YOU KNOW WHAT I MISS? THE TEAM WORK. THE SYNCHRONICITY. READING THE WAY YOU MOVED YOUR BODY. THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT ME. THE WAY YOU KNEW HOW I FELT BEFORE I DID. NOT JUST IN THE GAME. -YEAH, WE WERE A TERRIFIC TEAM. -[SIGHS] WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE PLAYED THAT TOURNAMENT FIVE YEARS AGO. WE WOULD'VE ACED IT. HI.
