 Baywatch (1989–2001): Season 1, Episode 3 - Second Wave - full transcript 
 Eddie is haunted by his bitter past when a former friend of his, named Jimmy, arrives from his home in Philadelphia and immediately causes friction over personal issues they had while they were in a foster home. Then, Eddie gets suspended for getting into a fight with Jimmy at the beach, and Craig has to bail him out of jail for fighting on the streets with Jimmy and his gang. When Eddie comes clean and decide to turn Jimmy in, the thug slips away and decides to get even with Eddie once and for all by setting his lifeguard tower afire, with Eddie and Shauni still inside. Meanwhile, Mitch stresses over his upcoming lifeguard re-check with Captain Thorpe, which turns out to be quite different than he expected. Also, Trevor begins to re-think his lifeguard career at the beach club after he rescues his current girlfriend, Lisa Peters, and she later nearly dies from secondary drowning.

 -KOKO: COME ON, WE GOTTA HAVE IT. -NO WAY. -GET IN THE SPIRIT OF GIVING, B.J. NO BOARD, NO CEREMONY. NO CEREMONY, NO WAVES. -BUT IT'S NEW. IT'S NEVER EVEN BEEN IN THE WATER. -THAT'S THE POINT, MAN. IF THE SURF SACRIFICE'S GOING TO WORK, IT'S GOTTA BE A VIRGIN BOARD. YOU WANT THE WAVES, DON'T YOU? -VIRGIN SURFBOARD OR VIRGIN SURFER... IT'S YOUR CHOICE. -TAKE IT. TAKE THE DAMN BOARD. THAT'S WEAK, MAN. THAT'S ALL A BUNCH OF SUPERSTITIOUS JUNK. -WOULD YOU GET WITH THE CALIFORNIA SWING? VIRGIN SURFBOARD BURNING IS A WELL-RESPECTED CUSTOM. SO START RESPECTING IT. -WHAT SPIT! LIKE YOU BURNED A LOT OF SURFBOARDS IN PHILI. -NO, WE DIDN'T BURN BOARDS EXACTLY, BUT WE HAD OUR FAIR SHARE OF CUSTOMS. -[RADIO] ALL RIGHT, LA, IT'S A FANTASTIC HOUR... -HI, HONEY. MORNING. [KNOCKS ON THE DOOR] -DON'T. -WHY? IT'S THE FOURTH TIME THIS WEEK. IT'S BECOMING A ROUTINE. -IT TAKES FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN AT LEAST TO MAKE A ROUTINE. GOOD MORNING. -HI.

I'M NOT GOING TO SAY A WORD. I FIGURE YOU'LL GET AROUND TO OPENING UP TO ME. -ME TOO. -WHAT? I'M GOING THROUGH A LITTLE CULTURE SHOCK. WORKING AT HOME IS AN IDEA THAT'S NEW TO ME. I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D EASE INTO IT UNTIL... I'M COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WORKING ON A BRIEF IN MY SHORTS. IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME... I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE. -LIKE DRUMS IN THE JUNGLE, WORD GETS OUT FAST WHEN THE SURF'S UP. DON'T MIND ME. I'M MAKING MY ROUNDS ON FOOT THIS MORNING. -OH. THIS IS THE FIRST GOOD SWELL IN WEEKS, CAN I GIVE THE GUYS JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER? -NO. WINNING MOST CONGENIAL LIFEGUARD AWARD ISN'T IMPORTANT. IT'S TIME TO TURN THE WATER OVER TO THE SWIMMERS.

THE KIND OF PLACE WE USED TO TRASH ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. STOP BY SOMETIME. BUY ME A DRINK. BUY ME THREE YEARS' WORTH. THAT'S WHAT YOU COST ME -WE BOTH DID OUR TIME.

THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED. -BOYS: AH! -TAKE IT UP TO THE CLUBHOUSE. YOU COUNTY LIFEGUARDS REALLY KNOW HOW TO SIFT THE LAST GRAIN OF FUN FROM A BEACH DAY. -YOU TAKE SOME TIME TO LEARN THE RULES, FOLLOW PROCEDURES, YOU'D MAKE EVERYBODY'S BEACH DAY A LOT MORE FUN. -THERE'S ONLY ONE RULE ON MY BEACH, NOBODY DROWNS, AND SO FAR THAT'S NEVER BEEN BROKEN. SO YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PROCEDURES AND SHOVE THEM. -AS USUAL, PROFESSIONAL TO THE CORE. -RECHECK, HUH? -DON'T WORRY. IT'S ONLY FOR LIEUTENANTS. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS WHAT THORPE HAS IN MIND? -YOU KNOW THORPE AS WELL AS I DO. -YEAH. IT'S GOING TO BE HELL... [DOORBELL RINGING] -OH. [DOORBELL RINGING] -HELLO. - HI, IT'S JIMMY ROCHE.

JIMMY: BUT LIFE GOES ON, THOUGH. FRIENDS GET SEPARATED... -GINA: YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY FOR DINNER. -JIMMY: THAT'S VERY KIND. -WE CAN'T. WE GOT BIG PLANS FOR TONIGHT.

WE'LL DINE, WE'LL DANCE, WE'LL... -LET ME CHECK WITH-- -DADDY? YOU'RE NOT JAIL BAIT. YOU DON'T NEED DADDY'S CONSENT. DOES THIS MEAN WE ARE ON FOR TONIGHT? -DADDY, DO YOU REMEMBER TREVOR? -HELLO. -MR.

IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. -SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. -CONSIDER ME THERE. HOPE YOU WIN YOUR GAME. -PETERS: I'LL WIN, TREVOR. I ALWAYS DO. -"GOOD MORNING, SHAUNI." "HI, EDDIE." IT'S HARDLY A DISCUSSION, AND CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO CARRY THE LAST FIVE HOURS. -I GOT THINGS IN MY MIND. -GREAT! LET'S HEAR ABOUT THEM. IT'S BETTER THAN LISTENING TO THE WOOD ROT. -I'M GONNA TAKE A PATROL. -YOU DO THAT. -MAN: HELP! [TENSE MUSIC] -MAN: HELP ME! [GASPING] HELP! -WE'VE GOT A PHONE OFF THE HOOK AT TOWER EIGHT. -OKAY, SID. WE'RE ON OUR WAY. -EDDIE: GIVE ME THE CAN. THERE'S A GUY IN TROUBLE OUT THERE, COME ON! -LOVE THE FLOATIE.

YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THIS? -I WAS ON A RESCUE. HE WAS IN MY WAY. -SHAUNI SAID HE WAS DELIBERATELY TRYING TO BLOCK YOU. -IT'S ONE THING TO SHOVE A GUY LIKE THAT OUT OF THE WAY. IT'S SOMETHING ELSE TO POUND ON HIM UNTIL ANOTHER LIFEGUARD PEELS YOU OFF. -SHAUNI SAID YOU HAD TROUBLE WITH HIM BEFORE. WHO IS HE? -I DON'T KNOW. -EDDIE, LEVEL WITH ME. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO TELL ME? AS OF NOW, YOU'RE ON SUSPENSION. THIRTY DAYS. -THIRTY DAYS? -YOU GOT IT. -THE SUMMER WILL BE HALF OVER! -YOU'RE LUCKY I'M NOT YOUR LIEUTENANT. I'D DROP-KICK YOU RIGHT OUT OF HERE. -HIT THE SHOWERS AND THINK ABOUT WHAT HE JUST SAID. BECAUSE NEXT TIME, WE'LL DO IT HIS WAY. CLEAR? -YES, SIR. -I WARNED YOU ABOUT HIM WHEN HE WAS IN ROOKIE SCHOOL. WE DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR LONERS, WE DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR HOTHEADS! I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T JUST FIRE HIM. -BECAUSE I THINK HE CAN PULL IT TOGETHER. -YOU THINK. -YEAH. -MITCH, YOU'VE GOT TO STOP TRYING TO BE EVERYBODY'S FRIEND AND START BEING A LEADER. -CAPTAIN THORPE? ABOUT THIS RECHECK TOMORROW, COULD YOU GIVE ME A PREVIEW? -JUST BE THERE. THE WEIGHT ROOM. TEN-THIRTY. -THE WEIGHT ROOM? [TURNS TAP OFF] -OH! AND THE HOT WATER? -WHAT'S THE IDEA OF LEAVING ME OUT IN THE COLD? YOU WANT TO BROOD AND SIMMER, THAT'S FINE. BUT I GOT TO HAUL-IN A THREE HUNDRED POUND BODY-SURFER BY MYSELF, THAT'S WHERE I DRAW THE LINE. -I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, OKAY? -WHO IS THAT GUY, EDDIE? YOU KNOW HIM. -DO US BOTH A FAVOR AND STAY OUT OF IT. -HOW? YOU KEEP DRAGGING ME IN EVERY TIME WE SHARE A TOWER TOGETHER. -THEN YOUR WORRIES ARE OVER.

WE'VE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. -HOW ABOUT JIMMY ROCHE. I GOT HIS NAME OFF THE POLICE REPORT. THE BARTENDER SAYS THAT'S THE GUY YOU FOUGHT WITH. -THAT'S FUNNY. I SAW THAT NAME ON A LIFEGUARD REPORT. YOU PUNCHED HIM OUT YESTERDAY. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM. -AND THE GUY WHO WAS HERE THE OTHER DAY. HIS NAME WAS JIMMY TOO. -OKAY. SO I KNOW THE GUY. BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. IT WAS LIKE IN ANOTHER LIFE, YOU KNOW? WE MET IN A FOSTER HOME AND... WE WERE TIGHT. WE USE TO RUN TOGETHER, WE WENT TO THE MOVIES TOGETHER. WE USED TO HUNG OUT. WE EVEN TALKED ABOUT COMING TO CALIFORNIA TOGETHER. WE... CUT CLASS. WE BUSTED STEREOS, PICKED FIGHTS. AND THEN... ONE DAY, WE WENT INTO A LIQUOR STORE. I WANTED TO BUY A BAG OF CHIPS AND... AND THEN JIMMY PULLED OUT A GUN. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE OWNED ONE. HE SAID, "THIS IS A STICKUP". I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?" HE SHOVED ME AND I SHOVED HIM BACK. THE GUY BEHIND THE COUNTER PULLED OUT A GUN OF HIS OWN. NEXT THING I KNEW, I WAS TAKING A LICE BATH AT COUNTY JAIL. -HOW OLD WERE YOU? -SIXTEEN. -DIDN'T IT MATTER TO ANYBODY THAT YOU TRIED TO STOP HIM? IT MATTERED TO JIMMY. HE GOT THREE YEARS IN JUVENILE HALL. HE BLAMES ME FOR IT. I WAS PUT INTO AN INSTITUTIONAL FOSTER HOME. -I'M SORRY, EDDIE. SORRY YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT. YEAH, WELL... [SIGHS] THERE ARE... THINGS IN LIFE YOU WANNA PUT BEHIND YOU FOREVER. I GUESS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE, IS IT? -MAYBE NOT. BUT YOU CAN START OVER. -TIME TO HANG UP THE GLOVES, CHAMP. -YOU'RE RIGHT. -MITCH: SUSPENSION'S OVER. YOU'RE BACK ON THE BEACH. -YOU'RE KIDDING... -NO, I'M NOT KIDDING. EDDIE YOU CAME CLEAN WITH ME. YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE PHILADELPHIA. I WANT TO SEE YOU GO THE DISTANCE. [DOORBELL RINGING] -CRAIG: I GOT IT. -GARNER? - YEAH. [BEAT] -HE WAS AT THE STATION WITH US. I ASKED HIM TO RUN A CHECK ON JIMMY. -THIS IS TURNING INTO A PARTY. I GUESS I'LL MAKE THE COFFEE. [ELEVATOR STOPPING] -COME ON IN. -BAD NEWS, CRAIG. THAT ROCHE KID, THERE ARE WARRANTS OUT ON HIM IN PENNSYLVANIA AND OHIO. ELEVEN COUNTS OF ARMED ROBBERY, AND ONE COUNT OF ATTEMPTED MURDER. HE SHOT A GAS STATION ATTENDANT IN THE STOMACH. -TREVOR: OKAY, SWEETHEART, PARTY IS OVER. DADDY IS GONE HOME. WE'RE OUT OF HERE TOO. [PANTING] YOU KNOW, I THINK HE'S ACTUALLY STARTING TO LIKE ME. THAT STUNT YOU PULLED WAS PRETTY STUPID, BUT... YOU CAN'T KNOCK SUCCESS -[GASPING] -YOU AWAKE? LISA. LISA, WAKE UP! LISA! -WHAT HAVE WE GOT? -RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. WE ALMOST LOST HER ON THE ROAD. THIS GUY PULLED HER OUT OF THE OCEAN THIS AFTERNOON. -IS SHE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT? -POSSIBLE HYPOXIA. CHECK ON HER BLOOD GASES AND A HIGH FLOW TKO IV. -WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER? -SHE'S DROWNING. -DROWNING? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! SHE WAS SOUND ASLEEP! HOW COULD SHE BE DROWNING? [TELEPHONE RINGING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -YEAH. - SHE LIED, MAN. CALIFORNIAN DREAMING BITES. -THEN LEAVE, MAN. - THAT'S THE IDEA. AS SOON AS I CAN SCRAPE A FEW BUCKS TOGETHER. HEY, BUDDY... WONDER IF I HAVE ANY FRIENDS OUT HERE WHO MIGHT LEND ME A COUPLE HUNDRED? -YOU COST ME TOO MUCH ALREADY. -HEY, NO SWEAT. MONEY'S EASY TO COME BY. I CAN GET IT FROM YOU, OR FROM THAT NICE LITTLE NEIGHBOR LADY OF YOURS. -I'VE GOT TO HIT THE BANK MACHINE FIRST. -OKAY. MEET ME IN AN HOUR. -WHERE DO I FIND YOU? -THE PARK IN THE MARINA, BY THE FOOTBRIDGE. -ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE THERE. [HANGING UP] [DIALING] -WE'VE FINALLY HAD LISA STABILIZED. I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY, BUT IT WAS CLOSE. -THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. -SHE ALMOST DROWNED. -ALMOST. BUT I SAVED HER. SHE ONLY SWALLOWED A LITTLE WATER. -SHE INHALED ENOUGH TO CAUSE SECONDARY DROWNING. -WHAT? -ALL YOU NEED IS A TRACE OF SEA WATER. THE BODY FLOODS THE LUNGS TO FLUSH OUT THE SALT. THAT'S WHY COUNTY LIFEGUARDS ALWAYS BRING IN A DROWNING VICTIM NO MATTER HOW WELL THEY SAY THEY FEEL. YOU CAN SEE LISA NOW IF YOU LIKE. -THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MAYBE THE CLUB SHOULD HIRE A COUNTY LIFEGUARD... INSTEAD OF AN AMATEUR. [TENSE MUSIC] -MORNING. -YEAH. -SOMETHING WRONG? -NO, I'M JUST NOT CUT OFF FOR THIS POLICE INFORMANT STUFF. -YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. -I KNOW. SO WHY DO I FEEL SO WRONG? -DON'T YOU HAVE ANY EASY QUESTIONS? -WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? -SIMPLE. JUST WAIT FOR HIM. THERE'S PLENTY OF BACKUP, SO NO HEROICS, OKAY? -DON'T WORRY. THE GLOVES ARE OFF. NEVER MIND. OKAY. -MORNING. -HI. -I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. -TREVOR, YOU SAVED MY LIFE. -TWICE. ONCE FROM THE WATER, AND ONCE FROM MY OWN STUPIDITY. -WHAT ABOUT MY STUPIDITY? I WAS THE ONE WHO JUMPED IN. -YEAH. THING IS... I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW ALL THAT STUFF. -TREVOR, I'M LEAVING LA. IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SPREAD MY WINGS, RIGHT? -WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? -MODELING. NEW YORK. I KNOW I CAN CUT IT. IT'S 3000 MILES AWAY FROM DADDY! THAT'S WHY HE'S BEEN FIGHTING IT FOR SO LONG. -UNTIL I CAME ALONG. I HELP YOU GIVE 'DADDY' A GOOD SCARE, IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, AND NOW HE IS A BELIEVER. BECAUSE NEW YORK IS ALSO 3000 MILES AWAY FROM ME. -YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE I USED YOU. -IT WAS DUMB OF YOU TO PULL THAT STUNT YESTERDAY. IT WAS DUMB OF ME NOT TO KNOW ABOUT THE AFTER-EFFECTS. IT WAS DUMB OF BOTH OF US TO THINK ANYTHING COULD COME OUT OF THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE. -I'M NOT GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER. -SEND US A POSTCARD. AND ALWAYS SWIM NEAR A COUNTY LIFEGUARD. -HEY! READY FOR YOUR RECHECK? -YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. -GOOD LUCK. -THANKS. -NOW THAT YOU'RE ALL HERE, SOME MORE APPROPRIATELY DRESSED THAN OTHERS, WE CAN BEGIN OUR RECHECK EXAM. SINCE YOU ARE ALL CLEARLY IN TOP PHYSICAL CONDITION, WE WANTED TO TEST YOUR QUALIFICATIONS IN OTHER AREAS. A SIMPLE CALCULATION OF WAVE VECTORS AND TIDAL DRIFT. GENTLEMEN, YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES. [TENSE MUSIC] -TWO HOURS IS LONG ENOUGH. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. -NOW WHAT? -I'LL PUT OUT AN APB. HE'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM ANYMORE. -I'VE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE. -YEAH.

ANYTIME YOU WANT TO USE THE BARBELLS OR THE WATER FOUNTAIN, OR ASK A QUESTION OR TWO, JUST STOP BY. -HI, MITCH. -HI, JILL. -YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT, AREN'T YOU? -TREVOR: THANKS FOR THE OFFER. I MIGHT TAKE YOU UP ON IT. BUT I'M NEVER GOING TO CARRY ONE OF THOSE STUPID CANS. HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU FOR THE DONUT? -TWENTY-FIVE BUCKS. BUT THE LIFEGUARD MANUAL IS FREE. [LAUGHS] -CONGRATULATIONS ON THE RECHECK. -I PASSED? -NOT EXACTLY. EVERYBODY FLUNKED.
