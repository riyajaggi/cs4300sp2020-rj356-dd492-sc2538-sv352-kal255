TOO CLOSE TO THE SHORE. -THERE WEREN'T ANY SWIMMERS. BESIDES, THIS GIRL'S A PRO. SHE'S-- SHE'S VERY COMFORTABLE IN THE AIR. A STEWARDESS FOR PACIFIC WEST. -MEETING IS OVER. I DON'T THE TIME OR THE STOMACH FOR YOUR SARCASM. -YOU'RE TAKING THIS AWFUL HARD, AREN'T YOU, BIG GUY? -MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE I JUST SPENT THE LAST HALF HOUR ON THE PHONE COVERING FOR YOUR STUPID STUNT. THANK YOU. I TOLD THORPE THAT YOU AND I WERE WORKING ON WAYS OF IMPROVING WATER PARASAILING RECOVERY TECHNIQUES FOR MEXICAN RESORT LIFEGUARDS. -MEXICAN RESORT LIFEGUARDS? -HE'S EXPECTING A REPORT IN HIS OFFICE BY THIS AFTERNOON. -WELL, DON'T LET ME STOP YOU, ALL RIGHT?

TURN IT ON. -IT IS ON, DAD. -OH. -DAD. -DON'T WORRY, I'M GONNA FIX BEFORE THE FIELD TRIP. -AND THE BAYWATCH HELICOPTER? -THE BAYWATCH HELICOPTER IS NOT BROKEN. -GOOD, SO YOU CAN TAKE THE KIDS FOR A RIDE IN IT. -FORGET IT. -BUT YOU SAID-- -I SAID "NO RIDES IN THE HELICOPTER." -OH, YEAH... AND THE BAYWATCH RESCUE BOAT? -IF IT'S NOT OUT ON PATROL. -GREAT. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, HAND OUT BINOCULARS AND LET EVERYBODY WATCH THE WATER? -HEY, YOU VOLUNTEERED ME FOR THIS DUTY. WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GONNA DO? I DON'T KNOW, JUST EVERYBODY'S EXPECTING A LOT. -AND WHY IS THAT? -BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS TELLING THEM ABOUT THE COOL STUFF YOU DO. -HOBIE, THE IDEA OF THESE FIELD TRIPS ISN'T ABOUT THE "COOL STUFF" WE DO. IT'S ABOUT SEEING HOW DIFFERENT KIDS' PARENTS MAKE A LIVING. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXCITING. -TELL ME ABOUT IT. LAST WEEK WE WENT TO JOEY'S DAD'S ACCOUNTING FIRM. ALL WE DID WAS LOOK AT SLIDES OF GRAPHS AND TALK ABOUT TAX SHELTERS. IT WAS REALLY LAME. -ACCOUNTING CAN BE INTERESTING IF YOU GIVE IT A CHANCE. -THE KIDS WERE LAUGHING AT JOEY ALL WEEK. -[LAUGHS] LOOK, I PROMISE I'LL TRY AND MAKE BAYWATCH EXCITING, BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE KIDS SEE SEE WHAT WE DO HERE AND HOW THINGS WORK, OKAY? -OKAY.

REGULATIONS DEMAND THAT LIFEGUARDS PROJECT AN IMAGE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL TIMES, ON OR OFF THE JOB. -BUT I DIDN'T KNOW. -KNOW WHAT? THAT YOU WERE POSING FOR A CHEESECAKE PIN-UP? -CAPTAIN THORPE, I DIDN'T POSE FOR THIS. -MCCLAIN, IF THAT'S NOT A POSE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. -WELL, I'LL TALK TO CRAIG. HE'S A LAWYER. -GOOD THINKING.

I WANT ANOTHER CHANCE, OKAY? -I'M SORRY, TAD. -WHAT, ARE YOU STUPID? I WAS PUSHED. -I'M SORRY. NO VIDEO CAMERAS. NO INSTANT REPLAYS, ALL RIGHT? WE'LL BE TALKING TO YOU. -MAKE SURE THE WEEKEND TOWER ASSIGNMENTS ARE SIGNED OFF. I DON'T WANT ANY SURPRISES COME FRIDAY NIGHT. AND DO ME A FAVOR, CHECK WITH THE GARAGE.

BUCHANNON, I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU. MITCH: ME TOO. LISTEN, MS. KELLER, I WAS THINKING ABOUT SPLITTING THE CLASS UP INTO TWO GROUPS, YOU KNOW? SOME COULD GO INTO LIFEGUARD TOWER, YOU KNOW, GET FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE. -WELL, THAT SOUNDS VERY INTERESTING, BUT I'M AFRAID THAT I HAVE TO CANCEL THE FIELD TRIP. -CANCEL? -WE HAD SUCH OVERWHELMING RESPONSE FROM THE PARENTS THAT I'M AFRAID I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ALL THE TRIPS. -OH, I SEE. KELLER: I'M REALLY VERY SORRY, MR. BUCHANNON. -NO, NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND. YOU RAN OUT OF TIME. THANK YOU. AND I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO HOBIE. -YEAH, WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT. -OH, BY THE WAY, IT WAS GOOD SEEING YOU AT THE PTA MEETING LAST WEEK. -YEAH, THANKS. CALL ME IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO RESCHEDULE. -I WILL. BYE. [DIALING TONE] -GOT ANY USE FOR 27 SOUVENIR LIFE PRESERVERS? -[SCREAMS] -THE POINT OF IMPACT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON, OKAY? IF THE RIDER DOESN'T POP ON THEIR OWN, SLIP YOUR ARM AROUND THEIR WAIST AND PROP THEM UP ON YOUR HIP. -RIGHT. -YOU GOT THAT? MADDEN: WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT SAVING LIVES? -EXCUSE ME? -YOUR RED TRUNKS AND YOUR WHISTLE WON'T HELP. THAT WON'T KEEP THEM ALIVE. WITH ALL THE DRUGS AND THE BOOZE, WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR HEADS? YOU HEAR ME? IF THEY WANNA DIE, THEY'LL FIND WAY, THEY'LL GET PAST YOU, THEY'LL OUTSMART YOU. AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN TO DO ABOUT IT. -WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? -BEATS ME. [TENSE MUSIC] [TENSE MUSIC INTENSIFIES] -[SCREAMS] YEAH! [SCREAMS] -HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE? -A DAY, MAYBE TWO, MR. HOLLIS. -OH, WE'LL START A RIOT IF DROP OUT IS OUT OF COMMISSION THAT LONG. THIS IS OUR MOST POPULAR RIDE. HAVE IT BACK UP TO SPEED BY THE END OF THE DAY. -SO THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE? -NO ONE'S EVER TAKEN A HAMMER TO US BEFORE, BUT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH TEENAGERS, YOU HAVE TO EXPECT THIS KIND OF THING. -WHAT KIND OF THING IS THAT? -VANDALISM. SOME KIDS DON'T NEED AN EXCUSE FOR IT. THEY JUST DO IT TO IMPRESS THEIR FRIENDS. -AND IF IT'S NOT THE KIDS HAVING FUN... YOU GOT ANY OTHER IDEAS? -NO. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY TRYING TO MAINTAIN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS COMMUNITY. -YEAH, WELL, FROM THE LOOKS OF ALL THIS STUFF, YOU'RE NOT GETTING THROUGH TO EVERYBODY. -YES, YES, I UNDERSTAND. BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF THIS ISN'T RESOLVED, WE'LL TAKE IT TO ARBITRATION, AND YOU COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COURT COSTS AND DAMAGES? RIGHT, OKAY, FINE. -CAN YOU DO ANYTHING? -OF COURSE HE WILL. HE HAS TO. -SHAUNI, THEY SAID YOU SIGNED A RELEASE WHEN THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN. -WHY WOULD I DO THAT? -DO YOU REMEMBER SOMEONE TAKING YOUR PICTURE ON LABOR DAY WEEKEND? -PEOPLE TAKE MY PICTURE ALL THE TIME.

THERE WAS THIS GUY. HE HAD ME SIGN SOME FORM. HE SAID IT WAS FOR HIS COLLEGE PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS. -OBVIOUSLY HE WASN'T MAJORING IN ETHICS. I THINK YOU GOT HAD. -IT'S OKAY, SHAUNI, THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED TO ANYBODY. -I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. AND HE WAS SO NICE, HE WAS DRESSED WELL AND POLITE. -YEAH, THEY'RE ALWAYS DRESSED WELL. -LOOK, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. I'LL TALK TO CAPTAIN THORPE. I'LL EXPLAIN ALL THIS TO HIM, AND YOU'LL BE BACK ON DUTY TOMORROW. -THANKS, CRAIG. -IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. -OH, YEAH. I'M GONNA PAY BIG MONEY TO SEE THIS. JOHN D.

NO, NO, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. HOW'S IT DONE? HOW'S IT DONE? FEET FIRST? FACE FIRST? WHAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO SURVIVE A WATER SLIDE? WHAT'S THE DEAL? YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING TRACK OF THE DAYS OF THE WEEK? CORT: WHAT'RE YOU SO MAD ABOUT? -JUST WHAT A GUY WANTS TO SEE. A PICTURE OF HIS GIRL PASTED EVERYWHERE. -WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S IN THE BUFF. -NOT UP HERE? WHAT? -[SIGHS] WHEN A GUY LOOKS AT THIS PICTURE, WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SEES? -WELL, A-- A GOOD LOOKING LADY IN A BATHING SUIT. -NO, HE DOESN'T SEE A BATHING SUIT. HE SEES WHAT HE WANTS TO SEE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I THINK YOU DO. AND I DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY TRICKED HER TO GET THE DAMN PICTURE. -WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, TAKE DOWN EVERY CALENDAR THEY EVER MADE? -WATCH ME. -HUH? -[SCREAMS] [OMINOUS MUSIC] -[SCREAMS] COMMENTATOR: AND IT'S 83-64. AND IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE HAS THIS ONE WRAPPED UP AT FIVE AND HALF MINUTES TO GO. -OH, DON'T DO THAT, YOU'RE GONNA JINX HIM. HEY, HOBIE, COME ON DOWN HERE AND LISTEN TO THIS. [PHONE RINGING] HELLO? OH, HI, MS. KELLER. NO, NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. YES, I'M SURPRISED, TOO. COMMENTATOR: MARTIN AND DEMARCO WILL WAIT. THEY'LL DRIVE TO THE BASELINE. WE'LL BE THERE. NO, THAT'S FINE. WE'LL BE THERE. THANK YOU. HEY, HOBIE, COME DOWN HERE FOR A SECOND, WILL YOU? [RADIO TURNS OFF] I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH YOUR TEACHER. SO WHAT WERE YOU FIGHTING ABOUT? -IT WAS NO BIG DEAL, DAD. JIMMY MARKOWITZ JUST HAS A BIG MOUTH. -IS THAT RIGHT? -IN A BIG WAY. YOU KNOW HOW THAT CAN GET ON A GUY'S NERVES. -SO WHAT DID HE SAY? -WELL, HE SAID-- IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. -IT'S NOT IMPORTANT? WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO GET YOU GROUNDED. -WHAT? -YEAH. NO TV AND NO VIDEO GAMES. -FOR HOW LONG? -THAT DEPENDS ON OUR MEETING WITH MS. KELLER. -[SCREAMS] -OKAY, FIRST WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU GAIN TOO MUCH SPEED AND LOSE CONTROL ON THE SLIDE. -THAT COULD BE A LITTLE FRIGHTENING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A KID AND YOU GET TURNED AROUND OR RIDE UP ON THE EDGE. SO THE KEY THING IS TO WATCH EACH PERSON AS THEY GO DOWN. EDDIE, I BELIEVE YOU LOST THE TOSS. -YEAH, ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHING] I'M GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, YOU DON'T WANNA GET TO WHERE YOU TURN AROUND LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT COULD BE DANGEROUS! [TENSE MUSIC] ALL RIGHT, SEND ANOTHER ONE DOWN! -I WANT EACH OF YOU TO GET A FEEL FOR JUST WHAT TYPE OF SPEED YOU CAN TAKE UP GOING DOWN THIS THING. AS EDDIE SO HAPPILY DEMONSTRATED, THINGS CAN GET A LITTLE OUT OF HAND. HE'LL BE THERE AT THE BOTTOM IN CASE ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. SO, VOLUNTEERS? -I'LL GO. -SANDY. THERE YOU GO. OH, MY GOSH. -[SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] -OKAY, SARAH, YOU'RE NEXT. SO ANY LAST WORDS? -DOES EDDIE HAVE A GIRLFRIEND? [LAUGHING] -NO COMMENT. OFF YOU GO.

THIS SITUATION ISN'T AS CLEAR CUT AS IT LOOKS. -POMEROY, THAT PHOTO LOOKS VERY CLEAR TO ME.

I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY. I SUPPOSE YOU JUST SAVE YOUR STORY FOR THE HEARING. I'M SURE IT'LL PROVE VERY ENTERTAINING. THANK YOU. -PLEASE GIVE ME A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN. -THAT'S WHAT THE HEARING IS FOR.

MITCH: I DON'T WANNA HEAR THAT. I WANT AN EXPLANATION, NOW. -THERE'S NOTHING TO EXPLAIN. -IS WHAT JERRY SAID SO AWFUL THAT YOU THINK IT WILL OFFEND US? -HE SAID THAT MY DAD WAS A BEACH BUM AND THAT ALL HE DID WAS HANG OUT AND WATCH GIRLS. -THAT'S IT? -HE SAID HIS FATHER MET WITH MS. KELLER AND GOT HER TO CANCEL THE FIELD TRIP. -REALLY? -UH, COULD WE TALK FOR JUST A MINUTE, MR. BUCHANNAN? -HOBIE, WAIT OUT IN THE HALL, PLEASE. -UH, JERRY'S FATHER WAS AMONG THE PARENTS WHO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN VISITING A LIFEGUARD TOWER. -WHAT IS IT? DO YOU THINK THAT LIFEGUARDS ARE INAPPROPRIATE ROLE MODELS? WE LAZE AROUND ALL DAY WORKING ON OUR TANS AND HANGING OUT AND AND HITTING ON GIRLS? YOU KNOW, IT'S A SHAME THEY'LL NEVER GET A CHANCE TO LEARN WHAT WE REALLY DO. MR. BUCHANNON, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IT WAS NOT MY-- WHAT HOBIE DID WAS WRONG, AND HE'LL SUBMIT TO WHATEVER DISCIPLINARY ACTION YOU WANNA GIVE HIM. LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. [SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -HEY, WHAT AM I? AM I THE INVISIBLE MAN? -I WISH. -YOU LIKE A LIFEGUARD FROM BAYWATCH, DON'T YOU? -NO, I DON'T. IT'S YOU. I DON'T LIKE YOU.

POMEROY, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY? -AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF AN AMERICAN TRADITION CALLED PRESUMED INNOCENCE. -MR. POMEROY, WHAT SHE DID IS A FACT. THERE'S NO NEED TO DISCUSS HER GUILT OR INNOCENCE. WE'RE HERE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO FIRE HER. -CAPTAIN THORPE, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THIS JOB MEANS TO ME. -AND WE'RE PERFECTLY WILLING TO ACCEPT WHATEVER PUNISHMENT THIS DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE DECIDES IS APPROPRIATE. -WE ARE? -AS LONG AS WE HAVE YOUR ASSURANCE THAT SHAUNI WON'T BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN ANYBODY ELSE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. -WHEN HAVE I EVER BEEN LESS THAN EVENHANDED? I MAY BE STRICT, BUT I AM ALWAYS FAIR. ANY LIFEGUARD WHO SHOWS UP ON A CALENDAR WILL GET THE BOOT JUST AS FAST. -MM... VERY CLEVER, MR. POMEROY. YOU SNEAK THE PHOTO WITH A LONG LENS? -500 MM. -ALL RIGHT, I AGREE. IT IS ONE THING TO GET PHOTOGRAPHED UNWILLINGLY. BUT IT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MATTER TO THEN SIGN A RELEASE. -MM. IS THAT YOUR SIGNATURE? -"PERMISSION TO PUBLISH." -THE NEXT TIME YOU SIGN FOR DELIVERY, YOU SHOULD READ WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING. -YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT, MR. POMEROY. AND IT'S A GOOD ONE. -DOES THIS MEAN I GET TO KEEP MY JOB, SIR? -YES, MISS MCCLAIN. -THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. -THANK YOU. -POMEROY... I DON'T LIKE BEING TRICKED. -I UNDERSTAND.

MY BOY TOOK HIS LIFE HERE. AND WHEN I LOST HIM, I LOST EVERYTHING. HIS MOTHER USED TO TRY TO TALK TO HIM. HE WOULDN'T TAKE ANYTHING FROM HER. THERE WAS NO GETTING THROUGH TO HIM. I WASN'T GOING TO LET HIM MAKE A FOOL OF ME. WHAT FOR? BECAUSE HE'S MY SON? HE OWED ME PLENTY, DON'T YOU THINK? I SAID, "FORGET, YOU'RE NOT PUTTING ME THROUGH A RINGER." I REALLY SHOWED THE KID. DIDN'T I? -DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, MAN. -YEAH, WHY NOT? -I'M A LOT QUICKER THAN YOU ARE. -LOOK, I NEVER TOUCHED YOUR SPEED SLIDE. -YOU DON'T BLAME THE PARK FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR KID? MADDEN: NO, I DON'T. IF HE HADN'T JUMPED HERE, HE WOULD'VE JUMPED OFF A FREEWAY OVERPASS. HE WOULD'VE OD'D, HE WOULD'VE WRAPPED HIS CAR AROUND A TREE. MY BOY WAS DETERMINED TO KILL HIMSELF. AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ANYBODY COULD DO TO STOP HIM. [SIGHS] [SAD SONG] -YEAH, THAT STUFF HOLDS A LOT. -OH, I HOPE I HAVEN'T COME AT A BAD TIME? -EXCUSE ME. WHAT'S UP? -I KNOW WHY HOBIE ACTED THE WAY HE DID. IT WAS REALLY VERY NOBLE OF HIM, STANDING UP FOR YOU LIKE THAT. -MS. KELLER-- KELLER: AMANDA. -AMANDA.
