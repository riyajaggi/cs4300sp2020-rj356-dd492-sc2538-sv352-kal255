 -MORNING, CAPTAIN THORPE. -WELL, GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE KEEPING FIT. HOW MANY MILES? -THREE. BUT IT FEELS LIKE A HUNDRED. -[LAUGHS] -YOU KNOW, A LIFEGUARD COULD DO THAT. -A LIFEGUARD IS DOING IT. THIS WAS MY FIRST TOWER, MITCH. TELL YOUR ROOKIES TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF IT. [AIRPLANE'S ENGINE] -MITCH: THAT PLANE IS IN TROUBLE. COME ON, MAN, PULL UP. -IT WON'T MAKE IT. [CRASHING IN THE WATER] -THORPE: CALL FOR HELP! -205 LINK TO CAMP 295. WE SPOTTED A PLANE CRASH NEAR TOWER 21. REQUEST EMERGENCY BACKUP IMMEDIATELY. -[RADIO] THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY. -THORPE: I'LL TAKE THE BOARD. [SIRENS] -[SCREAMING] HELP! -PLEASE, GRAB THE BOARD. -HERE. -ARE YOU HURT? -NO. -HE WILL BE. -BUTTON IT, SYLVIA. IF IT WASN'T FOR MY PRECISION FLYING, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TO BEGIN WITH. -WAS THERE ANYONE ELSE ON BOARD? -NO. -NO. JUST ME AND SKY KING OVER THERE. THE SUITCASE! -BUTTON IT, SYLVIA! -THORPE: COME ON. -MITCH: THORPE. -HOLD ON THE BOARD. -THORPE: I HAVEN'T FELT THIS GOOD IN YEARS. ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS, TO BE EXACT. YOU WERE GREAT OUT THERE, MITCH. JUST GREAT! -I FEEL GREAT, SIR. -YOU HAVEN'T BEEN BEHIND THE DESK FOR VERY LONG. YOU STILL HAVE THE EDGE. YOU STILL HAVE SAND BETWEEN YOUR TOES. -YEAH. -THAT'S WHAT I MISS. THE FEEL OF HOT SAND UNDER MY BARE FEET. THE SUDDEN CHILL WHEN YOU HIT THE FIRST BIG WAVE. THAT GOOD-NATURE GIVE AND TAKE WITH THE OTHER LIFEGUARDS. [SIGHS] YOU KNOW, MITCH? I DON'T KNOW HALF THE PEOPLE ON MY BEACH. -[CHUCKLES] COMMAND HAS ITS PRICE, SIR. GIVE ME A TOWER, MITCH. -WHAT? -KRAMER AND MCLAIN ARE IN TOWER 21 TODAY. IT'S THE PERFECT CHANCE FOR A COUPLE OF ROOKIES TO LEARN FROM A SEASONED VETERAN. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN IN A TOWER SINCE... -EXACTLY. A WEEK OUT THERE WILL GIVE ME A FRESH PERSPECTIVE. -ARE YOU SURE THIS IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA? -OH, IT'S NOT. IT'S AN ORDER. AND MITCH, WHILE I'M ON THE SAND, I'M JUST ANOTHER LIFEGUARD. -SURE THING. -SIR. -[LAUGHS] SIR. -[LAUGHS] -UHM. -CRAIG: YEAH, I SAW WHAT'S LEFT OF THE PLANE. THE ENGINE QUITTED. THE FELT LIKE A WHACK. -NOT A GREAT WAY TO START A VACATION. BET THEY WISH THEY NEVER LEFT WALLULA. -WHERE WERE THEY GOING? -ACAPULCO. MARIACHIS,BLUE SKIES, BEACHES. -TWO OUT OF THREE ISN'T BAD. -SYLVIA: IT HAS TO BE HERE! -HARV: WE SHOULD HAVE HAND IT OVER. -JUST KEEP LOOKING. -IT'S NOT A LOST EARRING. YOU CAN'T MISS IT. -WHY COULDN'T I LOSE YOU? -TRY MOVING YOUR EYES AS FAST AS YOUR MOUTH. -HEY, EXCUSE ME. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? -WE'RE LOOKING FOR OUR SUITCASE. -THIS IS A RESTRICTED AREA. -IT'S OUR PLANE, WE CAN GO WHATEVER WE WANT WITH IT. -AFTER THE NTSB GUYS GET THROUGH. THEY'LL WANT TO SIFT THROUGH WAS LEFT AND FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG. -HARV WAS FLYING. THERE. I SAVED THEM THE TROUBLE. -COME ON, DEAR. COME ON, DEAR. COME ON. WELL, THAT'S ALL. FACE IT, HONEY, IT'S NOT HERE. WELL, LISTEN... LET'S GET GOING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL. I HOPE WE HAVEN'T CAUSED ANY PROBLEM. THANK YOU. -WHAT'S UP? -IF WE ARE STILL IN THE COUNTRY WHEN SHELDON OPENS THE VAULT ON MONDAY, WE'RE DEAD. -WE'LL BE LONG GONE, AND A MILLION DOLLARS RICHER. REMEMBER? WE WERE PLANNING TO DITCH THE BAG AT SEA, ANYWAY. -THAT WAS A STUPID IDEA! I HAPPEN TO HAVE A VERY HONEST FACE. WE COULD'VE SNEAKED THAT BAG RIGHT THROUGH MEXICAN CUSTOMS. -NOW YOU CAN BE THANKFUL I IGNORED YOU. -[GRUNTS] -WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER LAST WEEK. -AT MY PLACE, YOU ALWAYS EAT IT FIRST. GO ON. -MITCH: MAYBE THIS WILL HELP. -I'VE NEVER SEEN A RESTAURANT CONSULTANT AT WORK BEFORE. -AND... -I HAVE A NEW-FOUND RESPECT FOR YOUR PROFESSION. -IT'S NOT LIFEGUARDING. BUT THEN... -BUT THEN, IT'S A LOT MORE USEFUL IN OHIO. -YEAH. THAT'S SORT OF WHY I ASKED TO SEE YOU. THEY NEED ME SOONER THAN I THOUGHT. WHAT IT REALLY MEANS, IS THAT I HAVE TO LEAVE ON TUESDAY, AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE HOBIE WITH ME. -TUESDAY! -I'M SORRY THIS IS SO SUDDEN. HE WAS LEAVING ANYWAY, IT'S JUST HAPPENING A FEW WEEKS EARLY. -I THOUGHT WE AGREED I'D HAVE HOBIE THROUGH THE SUMMER. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE EARLY, DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE HAS TO. -THINK ABOUT HOBIE. HE'S GOING TO BE LIVING MOST OF THE YEAR IN COLUMBUS. I WANT HIM TO LIKE IT. THAT MEANS LETTING HIM HELP CHOOSE HIS SCHOOL, HIS NEIGHBORHOOD -YOU CAN MAKE SOME NEW FRIENDS, FIND YOUR WAY AROUND, INSTEAD OF DROPPING INTO SCHOOL COLD ON DAY ONE. -I JUST FINISHED SUMMER SCHOOL. I WON'T HAVE ANY VACATION ON THE BEACH. -WE'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU NEXT SUMMER. -JUNIOR LIFEGUARD TRAINING ISN'T EVEN OVER YET. I'LL BE BEHIND NEXT SUMMER. -IT'S OKAY, I'LL COACH YOU MYSELF. -YOU WANT ME TO GO? -NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO. BUT YOUR MOM-- WE KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. GOT TO GET YOUR FEET WET IN OHIO. -DAD, IT'S OHIO, THERE'S NO PLACE TO GET THEM WET IN. -WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS MORE TONIGHT. I'VE GOT SOME STUFF IN THE GARAGE TO SORT-- -WHAT'S THE POINT? YOU'VE ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND. -WAIT A SECOND. -[DOOR OPENS] -I HAVE FOUR DAYS TO HAVE A YEAR'S WORTH OF FUN. I'LL STAY AT CLARK'S HOUSE TONIGHT. -GET BACK HERE! -MAYBE HE JUST NEEDS TIME TO GET USED TO IT. -SO DO I. -I REMEMBER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A ROOKIE. ALL THAT INTENSE CONCENTRATION. NOTHING EXISTS BUT YOU AND THE WATERLINE. -I WISH. -YOU DON'T WANT LET ANYTHING DISTRACT YOU, BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE YOUR MIND OFF YOUR JOB FOR ONE MOMENT, SOMEONE COULD DIE. THE WATER OUT THERE IS CRISS-CROSSED WITH RIPTIDES. -WAS THERE A REASON YOU PICKED OUR TOWER? -CAPTAIN, SIR? -BECAUSE THIS IS TOWER. I WAS HERE THE FIRST DAY THEY PUT IT ON THE SAND. AND JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY SINCE. OF COURSE, ALL THE TOWERS ARE MY TOWERS NOW, BUT... THIS ONE WILL ALWAYS BE SPECIAL. -HOW NICE. -TELL ME THIS IS GOING TO WORK. -ALL I HAVE TO DO IS PUSH THIS LITTLE BUTTON. A CO2 CARTRIDGE WILL EXPLODE, IT WILL INFLATE A BALLOON AND THE BAG WILL RISE TO THE SURFACE. HAVE A LITTLE FAITH. ANY MOMENT NOW, THAT BAG IS GONNA RISE TO THE SURFACE. BY THIS AFTERNOON, WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY TO ACAPULCO! [PLAYFUL MUSIC] ANY MOMENT NOW! IT MUST BE VERY DEEP. I WONDER WHAT WENT WRONG. -YOU BUILT IT. -I RESENT THAT. [BUBBLING WATER] -HARV: GOOD THING WE TOOK THOSE SCUBA LESSONS. -SYLVIA: SHUT UP AND ROW. -GAYLE: I KNOW MY CERAMIC DUCK IS HERE SOMEWHERE, BECAUSE I DIDN'T TAKE IT WITH ME. -MITCH: GAYLE, YOU TOOK IT WITH YOU WHEN YOU MOVE OUT. I KNOW YOU DID. MY SURFER DUDE CAP MYSTERIOUSLY VANISHED WHEN YOU LEFT -I HATED YOUR SURFER DUDE CAP. -I HATED YOUR CERAMIC DUCK. -IT'S FUNNY HOW THEY BOTH DISAPPEARED. -SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING I LOVE IS DISAPPEARING THESE DAYS. DAMN IT. I'VE GOT IT, OKAY? I'VE GOT IT. -YOU KNOW, HOBIE ISN'T GOING FOR GOOD. HE'LL BE BACK FOR THE HOLIDAYS. FOR THREE MONTHS IN THE SUMMER YOU CAN CALL ANY TIME YOU WANT. -REMEMBER THIS? PUERTO VALLARTA? IT WAS THE ONLY DAY OF THE WHOLE WEEK THAT WE CAME OUT OF THE HOTEL ROOM. -YEAH. -OH, HERE WE ARE. LOON LAKE WITH... YOUR WEIRD COUSIN, WHAT WAS HER NAME? -ENID. -ENID. -YEAH. -YOU LOOK GOOD HERE. REMEMBER ME? MASTER FISHERMAN. [LAUGHS] I STUCK MYSELF WITH SO MANY LURES, YOU HAD TO TAKE ME TO TOWN FOR A TETANUS SHOT. YEAH. -HEY... LOOK, YOUR SWEATER. I BOUGHT YOU THIS, BUT IT WAS... TEN TIMES TOO BIG AND TEN THOUSAND DEGREES TOO WARM. BUT YOU WORE IT ANYWAY. [CRASH] -GAYLE? GAYLE? -ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? -I BROKE YOUR LIFEGUARD MUG. -HEY, IT'S OKAY. -[SOBBING] YOU DRANK OUT OF THIS MUG EVERY SINGLE DAY. IT HAD A PERMANENT BROWN STAIN AT THE BOTTOM AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH I SCRUBBED AND CLEANED IT... IT STILL SMELLED LIKE COFFEE. -OH, COME HERE. -[SOBBING] -COME HERE. DON'T WORRY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. -MITCH... I BURNED YOUR CAP. -I CRUSHED YOUR DUCK. -YOU CRUSHED MY DUCK? -YOU BURNED MY CAP. [LAUGHING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] -YOU'RE HOME EARLY. -I FORGOT MY BASEBALL CARDS. -GOT SOME MAJOR TRADING TO DO. SO... DID YOU GET EVERYTHING PACKED? -NO. LOOK, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT COLUMBUS, AND ABOUT HAVING TO CUT YOUR SUMMER SHORT. I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOUR DAD OR YOUR FRIENDS. AND I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME VERY MUCH RIGHT NOW. -IT'S NICE TO KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING. DIDN'T YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO BE AWAY FROM YOU, EITHER? -NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. -HELLO, HOBIE. -GOOD MORNING. -MORNING. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE ALL JOGGED DOWN TO GET A COUPLE OF FRUIT SMOOTHIES LIKE WE USED TO? -YEAH! -I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA. -WHY NOT? -I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT. IN FACT, I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR BREAKFAST AT ALL. I'M SORRY. -IT'S ALL RIGHT. -WE'LL TALK TONIGHT. -SURE. -OKAY. -CRAIG: OH, MITCH, PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU, DON'T MAKE MORE OUT OF IT THAN IT IS. -NO, NO, IT WASN'T JUST A ROLL IN THE HAY. IT WAS LIKE IT USED TO BE, BEFORE WE STARTED FIGHTING. -THE FIGHTING STARTED WHEN YOU MET. -ALL RIGHT. BEFORE THE FIGHTING GOT BAD. -PROBLEMS DON'T GO AWAY JUST BECAUSE YOU WENT TO BED. YOU'RE STILL DIVORCED. -THAT CAN CHANGE. SOMETHING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. -THE MARRIAGE IS OVER. SHE'S GOING TO OHIO WITH HOBIE. -MAYBE SHE WON'T, YOU KNOW. MAYBE WE CAN BE A FAMILY AGAIN. -DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF. -I LOVE HER. I ALWAYS HAVE. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE JUST BECAUSE YOU SIGNED THE DIVORCE PAPERS. -SYLVIA! SYLVIA! LOOK! SYLVIA! LOOK! I THINK I FOUND A GOLD DOUBLOON. -[GRUNTS] -ARE YOU CRAZY? THAT COULD BE WORTH A FORTUNE. -IT WAS A BOTTLE CAP, MR. COUSTEAU. WE'VE LOST A MILLION DOLLARS, AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SUNKEN TREASURE? -I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS... THE MONEY IS GONE! WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND IT. I'M JUST LOOKING AT OPTIONS HERE. -IT'S MONDAY. THAT MEANS THE BANK IS OPEN. BY NOW, SHELDON KNOWS A FEW BUCKS ARE MISSING. PRETTY SOON HE'LL NOTICE HIS TWO STAR EMPLOYEES ARE MISSING, TOO. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO? GO BACK AND SAY, "OOPS! OUR MISTAKE?" -MAKE A RUN FOR THE BORDER. -WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE GET THERE? SELL TORTILLAS? -THAT'S AN OPTION. -I WANT MY SEASIDE VILLA. MY LUSCIOUS TAN. MY HOT LATIN LOVER. I WON'T GIVE THAT UP. -HEY! WAIT A MINUTE! I THOUGHT I WAS YOUR HOT LATIN LOVER. SYLVIA! SYLVIA! -THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO WATCH ON THE SUN. TEN O'CLOCK. SPOT THE SINKER. -WE SPOKE. SHE HASN'T EVEN WADED SINCE SHE SAW JAWS 2. -EIGHT O'CLOCK. -SHAUNI: WOW. LOOKS LIKE HE IS IN FINE SHAPE TO ME. -FOR AN ANCHOR. -EXCUSE ME? -HE'S BUILT LIKE A SLAB OF BEEF. AND BEEF DOESN'T FLOAT. IF HE GOT INTO TROUBLE, HE'D SINK LIKE A STONE. -ARE YOU GOING TO BE HERE ALL DAY? -THE FULL SHIFT.

WE CAN'T LET CAPTAIN CLUCK DOWN. -MITCH: NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. -I JUST THOUGHT... NEVER MIND. -I KNEW LAST NIGHT WAS A MISTAKE. -HOLDING YOU LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT MAYBE WE WERE STARTING SOMETHING. -I THOUGHT WE WERE ENDING SOMETHING. ENDING AS FRIENDS INSTEAD OF ENEMIES. I HOPE THAT'S STILL TRUE. -I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HOURS I SPENT WATCHING YOU SLEEP. SNUGGLED UP AROUND YOUR PILLOW, STEALING THE SHEETS. IT WAS ALL SO QUIET. IT WAS ALL SO PERFECT. IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING WAS BEHIND US, YOU KNOW. ALL THE PAIN, ALL THE ARGUING. -DID YOU THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE WE MADE LOVE, EVERYTHING WOULD BE DIFFERENT? -NO. NO, BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS THE BEGINNING. IT WASN'T SOMETHING I TOOK CASUALLY. -UH-UH. AND WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT ME? -I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. -NO. WHAT YOU MEANT WAS THAT I'M NOT AS NOBLE AND PURE AND GOOD-HEARTED AS THE ALWAYS PERFECT, ALWAYS CERTAIN MITCH BUCANNON. UNLIKE YOU, I'M JUST A MERE MORTAL. I DON'T ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING. LIKE LAST NIGHT! -LIKE MOVING TO OHIO. -JUST STOP FIGHTING, ALL RIGHT? [SLAMMING THE DOOR] SHUT UP! I'LL GO WHEREVER YOU WANT ME TO GO. -HEY, HOBIE. -I JUST WANT IT TO STOP! [RESTAURANT MURMUR] -MITCH: I'VE NEVER BEEN ALONE BEFORE. I LEFT MY PARENTS', I MOVED IN WITH CRAIG. THEN THERE WAS GAYLE, THEN THERE WAS HOBIE. AND NOW THEY ARE LEAVING... IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO GET USED TO IT. -YOU'RE GOING ABOUT THIS ALL WRONG. YOU CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND FEELING LOUSY. THAT WAY, SHE WINS. -NO, IT'S NOT JUST GAYLE. A YEAR AGO, WE WERE A FAMILY. ON TUESDAY, I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT A BUNCH OF EMPTY ROOMS. -YOU'VE GOT TO BE STRONG. LOOK AT THIS AS A CHANCE TO START A WHOLE NEW LIFE. THAT'S WHAT I DID WHEN CECELIA-MARIE LEFT. -NO. YOU CALLED IN SICK THREE DAYS IN A ROW AND YOU SAT IN THE DARK LISTENING OVER AND OVER AGAIN "TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS". -OH. -HERE YOU GO. -OKAY, IT WAS ROUGH AT FIRST, BUT THEN I REALIZED THERE WERE OTHER WOMEN OUT THERE. WOMEN WHO COULD MAKE ME HAPPY, INSTEAD OF MISERABLE. LOSING HER WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. -BEING ALONE, THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GONNA KILL ME. BEING WITHOUT HOBIE, THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA KILL ME. -YOU HAVEN'T LOST HIM. HOBIE'S ALWAYS GONNA LOVE YOU. AND HE'LL BE AROUND FOR SUMMERS AND HOLIDAYS. -GARNER: AND IN THE MEANTIME, DO WHAT I DID, MEET NEW PEOPLE. GO TO NEW PLACES. DO SOMETHING YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO, BUT NEVER COULD. -I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT BUYING A MOUNTAIN BIKE, HITTING SOME TRAILS. -THERE YOU GO. THAT'S THE ATTITUDE. MAYBE WE COULD GO TOGETHER NEXT WEEK. -OKAY. -BUT EVERY PLACE I WENT, I KEPT THINKING WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE WITH CECELIA-MARIE THERE. -MAYBE EDDIE CAN GO. I BET HE HASN'T SEEN THE SIERRAS UP CLOSE. -AND EVERY NEW THING I TRIED, I WONDERED IF CECELIA-MARIE HAD DONE IT WITH SOMEONE ELSE. -WE COULD GET SOME SADDLEBAGS AND MAKE IT AN OVERNIGHTER. -LET'S GO WAY UP INTO THE BACK COUNTRY. -OKAY. -AND EVERY NEW WOMAN I MET, I SAID... "SHE'S NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS CECILIA-MARIE." -WHAT DO YOU SAY, GARNER? WANT TO COME WITH US? -CRAIG: GARNER? -DAMN, I MISS HER. I GOTTA GO. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT'S WRONG? -NOW I FEEL ALONE. YOU GUYS ARE A DRAG. -[LAUGHS] -[LAUGHS] -GAYLE: REMEMBER YOUR COMICS? -YEAH. -DON'T YOU WANT TO TAKE THOSE POSTERS? -NO. THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE. I ALREADY CHECKED. -AH. I THOUGH THESE WERE YOUR FAVORITES. -DO ME A LOT OF GOOD IN OHIO. -HOBIE, COME ON. -I DON'T WANT THEM! WHY ARE YOU MAKING US LEAVE NOW? -WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS BEFORE, HOBIE. THEY NEED ME IN OHIO. -BUT THAT WAS BEFORE LAST NIGHT. BEFORE YOU AND DAD STARTED TO GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. -[SIGHS] OH, BOY. -YOU AND ME AND DAD, WE CAN BE A FAMILY. WE CAN MAKE IT THIS TIME. BUT CAPTAIN CLUCK TELLS YOU TO MOVE, AND YOU GO RUNNING OFF. I GUESS WE KNOW WHO'S REALLY IMPORTANT AROUND HERE. -ALL RIGHT. YOU JUST STOP AND LISTEN TO ME. YOU ARE WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, OKAY? YOU'RE THE REASON WHY YOUR FATHER AND I TRIED SO HARD AND FOR SO LONG TO MAKE THIS WORK, BUT IT DIDN'T. AND IT WON'T. AND IF WE TRIED IT AGAIN, THE HURT WILL BE EVEN WORSE. -I SAW HOW YOU AND DAD WERE THIS MORNING. -YEAH, AND YOU SAW HOW WE WERE THIS EVENING. WE FIGHT LIKE THAT EVERY TIME WE'RE TOGETHER. -I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE-- -HOBIE, I AM SO SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET YOU GET YOUR HOPES UP. I GUESS THAT... FOR A MINUTE THERE I WANTED TO THINK IT TOO. FORGIVE ME. -I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO. I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIEND IN COLUMBUS. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] -OKAY. I ALMOST GOT IT HERE. -...AND THEN WITH THE ADVENT OF PLASTIC, WE SWITCHED FROM THE LARGE, RUBBER TORPEDO BUOYS TO THE SMALL, EASY-TO-HANDLE FLOTATION DEVICES WE HAVE TODAY. I HOPE I'M NOT BORING YOU, MCCLAIN -NOT AT ALL. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE HISTORY OF FLOTATION DEVICES. I ONLY WISH EDDIE WERE HERE TO ENJOY IT WITH ME. -THERE YOU GO. -THORPE: KRAMER. SIR, WE WERE JUST-- -DON'T TELL ME. HER HAIR GOT CAUGHT IN THE ZIPPER AND YOU HAD TO HELP HER OUT. -EXACTLY. -EVEN ROOKIES KNOW BETTER THAN TO TRY THE RAPUNZEL SCAM ON ME. -BUT, SIR-- -KRAMER! -WHAT? -YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE SHARING A TOWER LONGER THAN I EXPECTED. -YES, SIR. -THAT'LL TEACH YOU NOT TO SNEAK OFF ON PATROL AND LEAVE ME WITH CAPTAIN WINDBAG ALL DAY. NICE TRY, THOUGH. -THANKS. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] -HEY, PAL. -HI, DAD. -LISTEN, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. -ABOUT LAST NIGHT-- -FORGET IT. -NO, I'M NOT GONNA FORGET IT. THIS OHIO THING IS BAD ENOUGH FOR YOU WITHOUT US MAKING IT WORSE. -REALLY, IT'S OKAY. -OKAY. WHAT'S WITH THE BOOKS? -I WENT TO THE LIBRARY. -YOU WENT TO THE LIBRARY? -ARE YOU FEELING OKAY? -I WAS READING ABOUT OHIO, DAD. IT'S REALLY SORT OF A NEW PLACE. -IT IS? I MEAN, IT IS. -IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT OHIO CAN BE PRETTY EXCITING. DID YOU KNOW THAT JUST 15 YEARS AGO AN ENTIRE RIVER CAUGHT ON FIRE? -YEAH, I READ ABOUT THAT SOMEWHERE. IT WAS SO POLLUTED, IT WENT UP LIKE GASOLINE. -SEE? NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENS AROUND HERE. -SURE, WE HAVE THE BEACHES AND LIFEGUARDING AND ALL THAT, BUT THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN THAT. NO OFFENSE. -NO OFFENSE TAKEN. -IT'S LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD OUT THERE. -AND IT'S WAITING FOR YOU TO CONQUER IT. -YEAH. AND I'M NOT GIVING UP ANYTHING. I'LL STILL HAVE MY PLACE IN JUNIOR LIFEGUARDS NEXT SUMMER. WON'T I? -WHENEVER YOU WANT. JUST WATCH OUT FOR BURNING RIVERS. -DEAL. SEE YOU LATER, DAD. -YOU GOT IT. -I'M GONNA MISS YOU, DAD. -I'LL MISS YOU TOO. [DOOR CLOSES] -MAN: CHECK THIS OUT! [PEOPLE SCREAMING AND LAUGHING] - OHIO: LAND OF SPLENDOR, LAND OF WONDER. -ARE YOUR PARENTS MAKING YOU READ THIS? -NO. THEY'RE MAKING ME MOVE THERE. -MOVE? WHEN? -TUESDAY. I'M GONNA LIVE WITH MY MOTHER IN COLUMBUS. -FOR GOOD? -FOREVER, UNTIL NEXT SUMMER. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] -WHAT A DRAG. -TELL ME ABOUT IT. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] -WHAT'S GOING ON? -RIPTIDE! CALL IT IN! -[BEAT] -KILLER RIP! TOWER 21. BACK-UP REQUESTED. -HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT? -TWENTY, MAYBE THIRTY. BUT I'M SURE THERE'LL BE A LOT MORE. -THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, PEOPLE DON'T GO IN THE WATER WHEN THERE'S A RIP. -THEY DO WHEN THERE'S MONEY FLOATING IN IT. -GET EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT OUT THERE. CHOPPERS, BOATS, EVERY AVAILABLE LIFEGUARD. -YEAH. THIS IS BAYWATCH HEADQUARTERS. ALL AVAILABLE UNITS. RIP AT 21. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] -♪ YEAH.

DID IT OCCUR TO YOU THEY MIGHT KNOW THAT? -THEY DON'T! -HOW COULD THEY STEAL A MILLION BUCKS FROM THE WALLULA NATIONAL BANK? THEY SEEMED LIKE SUCH AN ORDINARY COUPLE. [POLICE RADIO] -THORPE: YOU COVERED FOR ME. YOU DIDN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT ME CRAMPING UP OUT THERE. -FORGET IT. I WOULD HAVE DONE IT FOR ANY LIFEGUARD. -CONSIDER YOURSELF ON REPORT. I EXPECT MY LIFEGUARDS TO BE IN TOP PHYSICAL CONDITION. -YOU CRAMPED. UP, NOT ME. WHY DON'T YOU REPORT YOURSELF? -I DID. YOU DIDN'T. -[SIGHS] I WAS JUST TRYING-- -YOU ARE NOT TO COVER FOR ANYBODY, ESPECIALLY NOT ME. IF I WANT A TOWER, I'VE GOT TO BE AS FIT AS I EXPECT MY MEN TO BE. AND I'M NOT.
