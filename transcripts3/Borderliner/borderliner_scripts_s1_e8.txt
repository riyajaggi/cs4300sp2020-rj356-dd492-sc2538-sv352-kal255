 Elisabeth Lund was an informant. Only Lindberg and myself knew she was working for us. He's not my colleague, he's a murderer. -This was no suicide. -It was an accident. Tomorrow morning, you're coming with me. We'll find Tommy's blood. He asked me to film you. Listen to me... We need to deal with Bengt. At this time, all we can say is that this case is related to drug trafficking. Put down your weapon. The blood from the screwdriver is Lars Andreassen's.

 I'll go to prison for murder. You have to talk to Niko. Niko? No, I can't. That's me covering up a murder. Elisabeth's killer walks because of you. -Don't you want me to investigate this? -Why do you insist on going after Josef? They used a different number to notify him. Josef was just a diversion. You need to take care of Nikolai Andreassen. He doesn't know enough. He'll back off. The messages are similar. I'm guessing it's someone in customs or the police. I'm disappointed that I didn't teach you to know better. This is shoddy police work. 6 WEEKS EARLIER -Hello. -Hi. BORDERLINER

 You forgot to switch your phone off. This ties you to Lindberg, Sundin and Josef. You know what? Just stay out of this! Niko! I can't say anything. Can you give me some time, please? Hello? Hi, it's Bengt. Yeah. Is Tommy there with you? Yes. I'll be late. You have to talk to him yourself. Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can. Yeah. This is Sven. -This is Hans Olav. -Yes? Niko found the phone. Okay. You know what to tell him. Are you okay? I thought you said my information was no good? I did some research, and I found something. I had a colleague check base stations for that phone number you showed me. The last time the phone was switched on, it was in this area, which you probably know quite well. That's your dad's house, and that's Josef's house. -You think it was Josef? -It has to be. -Do you want me to keep an eye on Josef? -Yeah, please do. That's great, thank you. Yeah? Nikolai Andreassen came after you again yesterday? Listen, this isn't a trap or a setup. I'm trying to help you. I'd also like to be paid for that drive. Okay. We'll let you know where to leave the stuff. I'm not driving around with it. Come and get it now, or I'll burn it. Is this yours? It belonged to Bengt Skare. He gave it to me. -Did he give you anything else? -No. Last time we spoke, you said you weren't in touch with Sundin. Is that still true? Yes. -What did you do in Sweden yesterday? -I was picking up some malt. Is that all? I stopped by a garage to fix a spare tyre. Tell me about that garage. I'm not saying another word until my lawyer's present. Four years ago, Lindberg asked me to help him... Take down Sundin. He gave me a mobile phone and some codes. The Swedes sent a text whenever they wanted notification. How many times have you contributed to drug trafficking? -I've sent about 20 of those texts. -20? And you never gave it a second thought? It takes time, you know. Building trust. We were actually about to get them when you arrested Lindberg. Is that what he told you? That it's all my fault? And you believe him? -Lindberg's lying! -Prove it. Hurry up! -What do we do now? -We take them out. All of them. Have you learned Swedish yet? Where is it? For your sake, I hope it's all there. Check it. Here. It's all there. -Are we done? -That's right. Take care of the payment. I don't ever want to see you again. Bastard. Nikolai Andreassen won't quit. Okay. Yes. Thanks. They wouldn't tell me. Sorry. No one's keeping tabs on him. -Right. What do you think? -I don't think there is any operation. But you'll never have it confirmed. Okay. I'll figure it out myself. Management are fed up with all this bad press the police are getting. If you want to stay, you'll keep your distance. -Understood? -Okay. -Ready? -Yeah! Good job, Milla! Come on! Shoot! Good job, Milla! Come on! DINER -This is Sven. -It's Hans Olav. -Call me back. I can't talk now. -We need to meet. -We have to talk about Sundin. -Bye. It doesn't say who it's from. -You don't know what it is? -No. I'm just following the instructions they gave me. If you could sign there, that would be great. Thank you. -Nikolai Andreassen. -Nikolai. This is Eva Sundin calling. -We need to talk. -We can talk at the station. Why would I do that? -I'll text you an address. -Okay. -Come alone. -Okay. -What about our operation? -It's shelved until your son backs down. -Then that will have to wait. -So you can warn Niko? No. So I can convince him to stop. And then you don't need to report him. I can't help you with Sundin if Niko doesn't stop this. I took a huge risk for you. I've lied to my boys. I'm about to lose them both. Can you let me sort this out, please? Lindberg killed Elisabeth. I'm heading up to inform Internal Affairs. We need you to testify. -Hi. -Dad, this is Kristoffer. -Kristoffer, this is my dad. -Hi. We need you to testify. I'm sorry, I don't know anything about your sister. No, but you've been working with Lindberg, which connects you to Elisabeth. This is both relevant and brand new information. I don't think this is a good idea. Lindberg has a video of you and Tommy. You probably don't want him to see it. He's seen it. What about Internal Affairs? No. If you're right, this doesn't end even if we arrest Sven. -This is going to be great, Pia. -Yeah. When I'm finished renovating, I'll sell it and reinvest in that housing project. -Are you selling the bar, too? -No. I'm thinking about expanding. -Maybe in Oslo. -Is that why the Swedes were here? Hello? Josef? We've received a tip that you're in possession of drugs. Why didn't you tell me that you stopped Josef at the border? Yesterday, you knew Josef was in Sweden when that phone was switched on last. Considering the signal was traced to such a specific location, I'm wondering if you've thought about who it might be, if it wasn't Josef? I had to find out for myself first. To make sure. So your father is connected to the car that Bengt stole drugs from. Your brother helped Bengt cover up a murder. Was your father involved in that, too? -No, not that I know of. -Does Lars know any of this? You know what this means. Lars' statement will be re-examined, Hans Olav has to come back in... If my dad's involved, our family will be destroyed, and Lars' kids will suffer the consequences yet again. Your family's not my concern. If Lindberg's telling the truth, if there is a bigger operation going on, then we'll ruin everything if we go to Internal Affairs. Give me 24 hours. -Just let me wait until tomorrow. -How much do you know? Please. I'm not going to stop you. Hello? Dad? Something's happened. How long are you on furlough? Only for Milla's concert. -Niko will come and get you. -Won't it be too crowded? Don't be like that. Lars... You need to talk to Niko. We'll say it was an accident. An accident. Tommy was our problem. Him seeing us was your fault, too. You said it yourself. "If we do this, we're in it together. No matter what." So what are you going to do? Dump him in the river? I don't know where he got that video. It doesn't matter. I'll turn myself in. Right now. No... It's my fault. It's my fault. I've lied. -I've lied and lied and lied... -Lars. Let's just tell him. Tommy? -Tommy? -Yeah? -What is it? -I need to talk to you. -Why? -I just want to talk. -Why? -Take it easy. Take it easy? Stop it, Tommy. You're drunk. -You're out. -What? Why? You're spending money you don't have, and you can't keep your mouth shut. -I need the money! -Tommy! Tommy, calm down! Calm down. Tommy... That's enough! This isn't your fault, dad. I told you to stay away from them. I know. I'm sorry. Why don't you ever listen to me? No one will ever know you were here. You know what you need to do. I didn't shoot Elisabeth. The gun only has your fingerprints on it. Only yours, Sven. It was the torpedo. They made me touch the weapon to use it against me. Why do you think you have the gun? Eva Sundin is using you to get to me. Did she give you the video? How many people have copies? This is the only one. Where's the gun? I can't do this. This ends here.
