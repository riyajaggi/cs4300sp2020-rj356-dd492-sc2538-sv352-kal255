 Elisabeth Lund was an informant and had infiltrated a crime network. Only Lindberg and I knew she worked for us. -So you're saying Lindberg had her killed? -Yes. All we wanted was an answer to who killed her and why. Now we are a little closer to that answer. NEW MESSAGE That's enough to pay off Josef. -It's worth 200 000 kroner. -And the rest of the money? I'm in possession of something you know more about than I do. If you help me, I can get it all right away. You do know Eva Sundin, don't you?

 Find her stuff. Otherwise, you know what's going to happen. I know someone who might be interested. I need a sample, so these people can try it. I pushed the screwdriver into his face. He wasn't breathing. I found this at the cabin as I was tidying up after forensics. -What was it? -An old screwdriver. He's had it all along. I found it right before you arrived. But then you brought Niko. How stupid are you? Bengt! We're all going to turn ourselves in. The blood from the screwdriver belongs to Lars Andreassen. It means that I'll be convicted of murder. My kids will be orphans. Hey!

 Drive. BORDERLINER What do you want on your sandwich, Erik? What do you want, buddy? -Cheese. -Cheese. -Milla? -Yes? -Are you ready to go? -Almost! Please hurry, we're going to be late. -Hi, Lars. -Hi. -You need to come with us. -Right. I understand. Can you give me five minutes to talk to the kids? I need to get a sitter, too. -Of course. -Yeah. -Ready? -Do I look nice? Beautiful. -Can you help me with this? -Of course. -There. You look beautiful. -Thank you. Daddy has to go to work now. So Sara will take you to that birthday party. What is it? It's nothing, it's just... What is it, dad? It's nothing, sweetheart. I'm just going to work. Go to the birthday party with Sara. You'll be fine. Sweetheart. I'll come home as soon as I can. Daddy has to go now. I'll be back soon... What happened? Tell me! -I can't tell you. -Yes, you can! Tell me! Say it! Just tell me, it's not that hard! -I can't tell you. -Yes, you can! Bengteboy. Where's our stuff? I have no idea what you're talking about. I know you have our stuff. Where's Josef? He sent you to do his dirty work? Give us our stuff, and we'll leave. -I don't know what you're talking about. -You don't know? -This is Anniken. -It's Nikolai. I've been attacked. Okay, I'm on my way. What was that? Still don't know what I'm talking about? Where's our stuff? See you soon, Bengt. -Are you okay? What happened? -I was assaulted after I arrested Bengt. -By...? -Two guys. Professional. Armed. -Where are they? -Down there. The ran when you arrived. I didn't see Bengt. Make sure he's okay, and then meet me down there. They're armed. Niko! Hey! Shit... Bengt! It's Anniken! Where are they, Bengt? Bengt! Answer me! Where are they? They left. Turn around, Bengt. Hands where I can see them. Turn around. Come on, Bengt. Put down your gun and get on your knees. I'll shoot, Bengt. Put down your gun and get on your knees, damn it! I'll shoot, Bengt. Come on. So do it. Shoot me. -Shoot me. -Put down your weapon and sit down. Hi. He's not coming. Wait, Josef. I don't get it. He was on his way. Calm down. I'll call you. -Can I talk to Lars? -No, he's being taken into custody. Sorry. -What's going on? -The area's closed off. -I can see that. What's happened? -I have to ask you to leave. -Ready? -Yes. May 10th, 2017. Lars Andreassen and Anniken Høygaard-Larsen. -Are they going to stay here? -I don't know. They could, you know. -Do you know what he's done? -No. Your guess is as good as mine. What were you talking about last night? It looked like you were discussing something. I didn't understand what he was talking about. He wouldn't say what it was. -I need to talk to you. -I know. Lars made a confession. You can see him before they take him away. -Where is he? -I let him step out for some air. Ten years in prison. That's far too long. I promised Kristin I would take care of them. You have, Lars. You've been great. Your kids are amazing. What did you say to Anniken? That Bengt killed Tommy. That Bengt strangled Tommy right before I arrived. That when I wanted to report it, Bengt threatened me. He pressured me to cover up his shit. I had no choice. He planted the screwdriver as a last resort. He's not around to defend himself, so... What did you say about the drugs? That Bengt promised me a cut as long as I kept my mouth shut about Tommy. What do I get? If this works out? Maybe a year, if I'm lucky. The most important thing now is that you're in the clear. So that you can take care of Milla and Erik. And delete that video evidence. Lars... Our theory, and Internal Affairs' theory, is that Bengt Skare killed Tommy Hagen. At this time, we can only say that it involves drug trafficking, and that Lars Andreassen is implicated and in custody. You'll continue the search for those who attacked Skare and Andreassen, in collaboration with Organized Crime, who will be in charge of this case. You've lost two colleagues today, in two different ways. I just want to thank you all for your cooperation. You will be assisted by neighbouring police districts. A temporary sheriff will be in place very soon. That is all. Yeah? That's fine. I'll come and pick it up. Thanks for calling. Bye. Pia, can you close the place today? I have to pick up a motorbike. -Sure. -Great. Pia is closing. Bye. Did you talk to you brother? Yes... It was... Jesus Christ. I was thinking... Now that Lars is so involved in the case... -His kids... -You can take some time off. Thank you. My father shot himself. That's a very definitive action. It's definitely not a cry for help. When it happened, I was frustrated that no one would tell me why he did it. No one probably knew. With Bengt, we at least have an idea why he did what he did. Yeah. Bengt didn't have his phone on him. Did you take it when you arrested him? No. He didn't have it on him. Take this with you. Careful, it's hot. You can leave. I got this. -I know how to make pancakes. -I was talking about the kids. They can stay here. Marta is fine with it. It's no problem as long as they're both in primary school. But when Milla starts secondary school... It looks like Lars will only be gone for a year. One year? What did he confess to? Bengt killed Tommy. Lars helped him cover it up. I can't talk about it now. POLICE DEBT CERTIFICATE CONFIRMATION -Hi. -Hi. -You're leaving? -Yes. A few things need to be double-checked, but I'll do it from Oslo. -What about you? -I'll stay a few more days. I need to sort out the situation with the kids. I've been thinking about something. You spent a lot of time with your brother over the past few weeks. -You didn't think something was off? -No, he was just distant. And I knew he was in a lot of debt, so I tried to help with the kids. Perhaps it's harder to see when it's someone you're close with. -Bengt was also in debt to Josef. -Yes, I know. If it weren't for his debt to Josef, none of this would've happened. I got the impression he tried to help them. You don't know him. No... -Did you find anything at Bengt's place? -No, but the dogs indicated in the garage. Maybe we'll find the people behind it via the phone from the car. But the case has been transferred to Organized Crime. You can look into it when you're back in Oslo. -I've got to go. -Okay. -Thanks for the teamwork. -Likewise. -Two chilis. -Two chilis. Hi. Can we talk? Of course. Bring this inside and put it in the fridge. Yeah... I'm really sorry. It's a difficult situation. But... -I'm worried about Hans Olav. -Don't worry. He feels responsible for the kids. And I'm not sure he's capable of taking care of them. I knew something was going on when Lars was here the other night. They talked for a long time, and the conversation was definitely on Hans Olav's mind afterwards. Now I understand why. To be told that his son was involved in this, while Mikkel and I are living here... Yeah... When was this? The day before his arrest. Hans Olav got really drunk afterwards. Which is understandable, but... I'll talk to him. What do you know? Marta said you talked to him. Yes, he needed help with the kids. No. We agreed that I would take care of the kids. You thought he would be in prison for years, why? Come on! What did he tell you? He didn't tell me anything. I know you've been up to something. The both of you. The question is why you're in the clear. I promised Lars I'd take care of his kids. I guess he can't trust you anymore. That thing with Josef was just a mistake. I haven't had one drink since then. Really? If you don't believe that, you can get the hell out of here! Milla! Milla! Erik! -What's going on? -Pack your things, we're going to Oslo. But we're about to eat. -We'll stop at McDonald's on the way. -Okay. Erik! -I'll join Milla for a while. -Okay. -Hi. -Hi. Why's dad in prison? It's because... He lied, he didn't tell the whole truth. Which was something very serious. He knew more than he said he did. -Does he regret lying? -Yes, he does. You know, sometimes... ...it feels good to finally talk about something you've kept a secret. When you don't have to lie anymore. One time when we were in Sweden, dad yelled at Erik because he took 200 kroner from his wallet without asking. But I was the one who told Erik to do it. Erik never told dad. He wasn't allowed to buy candy for the rest of the trip. How did that feel? When my piggybank is full, I'm giving it to Erik. Yeah? -Do you want me to carry it? -Yes. Thanks. I heard what happened. How are you doing? I'm okay. What's this? I've used it as a sideboard. Nothing to do with you. There you go. I've told them to order a cake. -Cake? -If you don't want it, I totally get it. It's your birthday. I thought that was a well-kept secret. You're not allowed to keep secrets from me. Fine. But I think I'll pass. -Sure? -Yes. I don't think you'll get the same offer from Internal Affairs. They want to talk to you. Happy birthday. -Hi. -Hi. -Is it about Lars? -No. Lindberg. Good. When are you charging him? We've gone through everything you gave us. We can prove that Lindberg and Eva Sundin were in the same area at the same time several times in the last four years. But nothing more. I arrested him right after he'd seen her. I taped it. Yes, but he can account for that meeting. The other ones are just circumstantial evidence. -And Lindberg denies it. -Of course. I can testify to everything I've told you. You have a strong testimony, but we're not sure it's enough. I am. In any case, that's for the court to decide, isn't it? The press will have a field day. They'll start digging into that tragedy from your home town. Three dead, you were the investigator, and your brother confessing to covering up a murder. There will be a lot of personal questions. Lindberg's defence attorney will use any doubt for what it's worth. Before we take this to the prosecutor, we need to know that you're prepared. Hello? Hello? Happy birthday! Thank you for this. Do you mean that? I wasn't sure if it was appropriate since... Milla and Erik wanted to do something fun for your birthday. And I thought it was a good idea. To get their mind off their dad. Lindberg will walk. There's not enough evidence. What about your testimony? It holds up. I can't testify. You can't start doubting yourself now. I understand that it's getting close, but you have worked on this for two years. It's not just that. It's not possible. I can't live like this. You have to include me. Can you tell me what this is really about? I can't testify against Lindberg. If his lawyers start digging up dirt about me... Everything will fall apart. And it will be my fault. Does this have something to do with Lars? That's me covering up a murder. The day I went to Tista, Lars got into a fight with Tommy Hagen. It was that suicide... I began investigating. Kristoffer! Wait! Why didn't you tell me this before? I wanted to keep you out of it. You managed that extremely well. I'm sorry. I promised Lars I'd take care of the kids. What about me and my family? What do you want me to say? I don't know, just say it like it is. That won't do any good. The man who killed Elisabeth walks because of you. This is from the car. Did you manage to turn it on? There are only two numbers on it, one Norwegian and one Swedish. Okay, thanks. This is Anniken Høygaard-Larsen, please leave a message. Hi, it's Nikolai again. Lindberg is involved with drugs in Tista. I'm sure of it. The phone from the car had codes from Lindberg on it. I recognize them, he always uses them. Call me when you get this... You know what, I'm coming to your place. I hope you're home. I've got him. Did you hear the message I left for you? Hi, Niko.
