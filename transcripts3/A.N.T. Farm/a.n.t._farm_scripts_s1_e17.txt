 I'm really looking forward to your lumber party. It's not a lumber party. It's a slumber party. Wait. You guys are having a party? Oh, yeah. How rude of me. I really should have not invited you sooner. Ooh, can I be not invited, too? Sure. Yes! Well, yours won't be the only sleepover in the neighborhood. Olive and I are having a slumber party that night, too,

 and you're not invited to ours. Party? What party? We're not having a party. It's okay, Olive. You don't have to keep our secret party a secret anymore. The cat's out of the bag. What secret? What party? What cat? I am very confused. You get used to it. Anyway, our party is going to be a gazillion times more fun than yours. I doubt it. We're having mani-pedis, facials, and a crepe bar. Well, we've got cats in bags. We should probably go check on them. How long have they been in the bags?

Fletcher! I have an opportunity for you that will change your life. But I like my life. Why? Good point. Go on. Last night I came up to do a comic book, ar idea and since you're a great artist, I want you to draw it for me. What's the idea? I just told you. To do a comic book. Boom! Right there! Llars, That's the whole idea? What about characters? Plot lines? Sure, I guess we could add some of those. So what do you say? You in, partner? No thanks. To collaborate. I'm a lone wolf. Well, I was a lone wolf. Niya, come to my sleepover party! Megan, come to my sleepover party! Svetlana, come to my... What I was trying to say was... Here! You know what? I'll just text you the deets. Chyna, you're having a party? What time should I be there? Sorry, Fletcher. This is an all girls party. Duh, why do you think I want to go? Listen, Chyna, I have bad news. I can't make your sleepover. What? Why not? I, uh, have a dentist appointment. In the middle of the night? Is your dentist a vampire? Yeah, and you do not want to go there with bleeding gums. Olive, what's really going on here? The truth is I've never slept anywhere outside my house. Ever. Not even when I had my appendix out. You were awake during surgery? Yeah, it was painful, but at least I could tell them how to do it right. Come on, Olive, you have to come! My party won't be as much fun without you. That's true. I am fun at a party. And if it makes you more comfortable, bring something from home. When I said, "Bring something from home," I meant like a pillow. I did bring a pillow. You're staying over for one night. How many of your clothes did you pack? All of them. Why? I don't know what I'm going to wear tomorrow. I don't choose my outfit the night before like some obsessive freak. Be careful with that. That bag has my breakfast! I like to eat this really rare, special cereal that you guys don't have. Corn Flakes? I think we have Corn Flakes. No, I've seen your cabinets, and you only have Honey Crusted Sugar Loops, Donut Crisp, Sugar Frosted Sugar Cubes, Cap'n Choc-o-Lard, Candy Cane Crunch, and High Fructose-ios. Those are my dad's. I don't eat that unhealthy junk. I usually just have leftover pie. Anyway, you can put your sleeping bag right here. You want me to sleep on the floor? Olive, your bed weighs a ton! Don't complain. We still have to carry up my headboard and nightstand. Hey Cameron, I've been thinking, and I want to help you with your comic book. I thought you didn't like that idea. Are you kidding? Pictures and words? Groundbreaking. Okay, but it might be hard to work here. My sister's having a bunch of girls over tonight. Really? Is that tonight? I'm willing to put up with them and work here anyway. Good, because I came up with an awesome superhero. Iron Man! Uh, I'm pretty sure there already is an Iron Man. Not the guy in the suit made of iron, a guy with a suit made of irons! He'll have irons for hands and an ironing board cape, and of course his tights. No wrinkles at all. I'm having trouble picturing it. But if I could see you in this outfit, I could draw it perfectly. But where are we going to find tights? Ooh, I know! Chyna's room! I'll go get them! No need. Already wearing 'em! But you didn't know I was coming over. You didn't call first? No. Okay, we got your bed set up. Is the room ready for you to sleep in? No, no, no! Why are yout will be painting my walls? Painting. Because color can have a powerful effect on mood and behavior. Green is soothing. I can't sleep in a room that's purple. Olive, how many times have I told you not to paint my walls? Once. I'm saying it right now. Do not paint my walls! See, I think a lot of this hostility is coming from the purple. I can't have wet paint everywhere when everybody shows up. Where is everybody? Hmm. I'm getting a video chat request from "Prettier Than U." Hey, Chyna! I just wanted to check in and see how your slumber party's going. Are you raising the roof? No, but that's the only renovation we haven't done. Is that a chocolate fountain? Niya! She's supposed to be at my party. Oh, yeah, a few of your Ant friends are over here. Like, all of them. Hello! Well, not all of them. Olive's here and we're having a great time. Chyna, these paint fumes are making me... Okay, green is not always soothing. So you didn't like Iron Man, but I think I came up with another great superhero idea. Okay. Can't wait. Hey, listen, while you're changing, I'm going to check on the girls. Make sure no one was injured in a pillow fight. No, I'm ready! Your superhero is a guy in a shirt? No. This is my mild-mannered alter ego. You've heard of Batman. You've heard of Spider-Man. Well, say hello to. Man Man! So he has the powers of a man? Yeah, but that man belongs to a gym. Now how am I supposed to compete with Lexi's party? She's got big crowds, chocolate fountains, and mani-pedis. I've got wet paint and vomit! Wait. Where did you get that? Oh. Your dad lent it to me. Of course, he's making me paint the garage this weekend. This whole night is a disaster. Calm down, Chyna. Look at the green. Look at the green. That's it! The green! This is awesome! It's like all these people are at your party. Except they're not. I just used my computer to replace the green wall with this old movie footage I found online. It's time to call Lexi and make her green with envy. You mean green with calmness. I say we make her purple with discomfort, but it's your call. Hi, Chyna. I knew it was you because you're the only one not at my party. What? Sorry, I can barely hear you over the noise. Guys, keep it down. I'm video chatting. Brendan, you're so crazy! Who are all those people? Oh, friends of mine. You don't know them. I have a lot of cool friends. Speaking of cool friends, I'm kind of chilly. Can I borrow this green hoodie? No, no, no, Olive... What happened to Olive? Um, I haven't seen her. That party looks awesome. Is that a young Jim Belushi? Paisley, didn't I tell you? "If you don't have anything mean to say, "don't say anything at all." Besides, our party is way better. We're having crepes and getting mani-pedis. Really? Well, we are having sushi and getting our hair done by a world-renowned stylist. What? Great! I just got chocolate on my pajamas! A little club soda should get that stain right out. Dab. Don't rub. Anyway, as you can see, we're obviously having a fabulous time. Oh, the sushi chef is here! Gotta go! I don't know what it is, but suddenly I have all these great ideas! It's like I have superpowers. Maybe I can fly. No! Please tell me this is not a sugar induced hallucination. Hello, ladies. Oh, Brendan, where did you learn to dance like this? From your father, the honorable ambassador to Argentina? What was that? I changed the footage. Nothing kicks a party up a notch like penguins! Yeah. I don't think Lexi's going to be impressed by a mother penguin spitting up a half-digested herring into its baby's mouth. We'll see, won't we? No answer. Hmm. I wonder where they are. Go away, Cameron. If you wore the tights, I do not want them back. Lexi? Aha! I knew something weird was going on here. Where are all your guests? Um... I sent them off on a scavenger hunt. Is one of the things you have to find an ugly hat? Yes. Olive's in the lead. Yes! Well, maybe we can at least get our hair done by your world renowned stylist. Unless he was slaughtered by the ninja or Jim Belushi. No, he's here. I'll just go get him. Olive, why don't you entertain our guests? So, which of these is our million dollar idea? None of them! Seriously? Pool Boy? Dare Deviled Egg? Spider Manatee? And worst of all, Iron Man. I mean, a superhero who irons? That's my mom! So then what do you suggest? Maybe we should do some focus group testing. I'll go see if I can find some girls ages 11 to 17. Guys, it's an emergency! I need someone to do our hair! Do you know anyone? That's it! This looks like a job for The Stylist! You don't have anything on under there. I know. This is how stylists wear their shirts. So, do you guys know anyone or not? Ha! I knew it! This sleepover is a big lie. You don't have a hair stylist. Don't be so sure about that, citizen. The Stylist is here! Fletcher? He's not a stylist. That's right, I'm The Stylist. Fighting crime and dry, hard to manage hair. You are now safe, citizen. From the front and the back. Wow, a shark! I love it! I just hope my head doesn't get caught in a fishing net. It's happened before. How is Fletcher doing that? He's an artist. Hair is just another medium. A sports car! Who else has hair that needs justice? No one. Come on, girls. This party stinks. Let's go back to my place. Paisley! Now! No. I'm staying! This party is fun. Lexi, if you want, you can stay and have fun with the rest of us. Fun? Your stylist is Fletcher, the sushi chef is fake, and that nightclub was just a trick using this green wall. Ooh! I could give you a hairstyle with devil horns. It'll be hot. Get this off me! You're going to wrinkle my pajamas. Did someone say wrinkle? This sounds like a job for Iron Man! Hey, bro. You got a little Candy Cane Crunch right there. Oh, thanks. Not like that, like this. Last night was so much fun! I actually slept outside my house! Good for you, Olive. Hey, where are all the other girls? They kind of all left in the middle of the night. I would've too, but I live here. Why? What happened? I was asleep. Yeah, but not in bed. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo! I don't do all that stuff in my sleep. Yes. Yes, you do. You do all sorts of crazy stuff. You even made me this sweater. You sleep-knit! Now that you mention it, I do sometimes wake up with a new blanket. Anyway, breakfast? Sure. What kind of milk do you take on your Corn Flakes? 1%? 2%? Soy milk? Lactose-free? Chocolate? Strawberry? Or hand-squeezed goat milk? Do you have skim? Skim? Who brings skim milk to a party?
