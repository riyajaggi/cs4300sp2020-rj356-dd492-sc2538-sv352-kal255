 Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand  the terrible destruction plaguing our planet.

 Stop! Stop! Hey, you, get down from there! Something bothering you, sonny? Yeah. Your truck is full of toxic waste, and it's leaking. So? So get it out of here -- now! This is a national park. It wa a national park, cowboy. But look at this official document right from your official computer. Ranger to headquarters. Can you confirm the Sly Sludge permit? It is? He can? That's right. And have a nice day. Let's roll 'em! [ Engine starts ] You can't do this! Watch me. Hey, pal! Whoa! My hat. ** Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Linka: Checkmate. Ahh! Not again. That's twice you've beat me, Linka. I thought you Soviets weren't into computer games. But we are into logic and strategy. Translate that into Brooklyn American. She means her moves follow precise plans, while yours are much more random and unpredictable. That's me -- a wild and crazy guy! Planeteers,  to the crystal chamber. There's an eco-emergency. Kwame: That's Yellowstone National Park in America. Oh, it is so lovely. Well, that's not so lovely. Wheeler: Hey, they can't dump toxic waste in a national park. Our old enemy Sly Sludge is doing it right now. How can we stop him, Gaia? I want Gi and Kwame to go with Ma-Ti to Yellowstone to help with the cleanup there. What about Wheeler and me? It's time those computer games you've been playing get serious. Our computer games? I'm sending you to check the environmental agency's computer. We must know how Sly Sludge is getting permission to do his evil polluting. Just you and me, kid. Ah-ah-ah. Hands off, Wheeler. Once again, you have moved without thinking. Oh, I thought about it. Wheeler... Sludge: Dr. Blight's hideout is up this way. ** [ Truck brakes squeak, hiss ] [ Truck door opens, closes ] Everything went just as you planned, Dr. Blight. Obviously, Sludge. What else did you expect from the world's most evil scientist? [ Coughs ] Sure is [coughs] smoggy in here. [ Coughs ] Much nicer than that fresh air outside. Thank you. It could even be more polluted, don't you think? It's my new air putrefier. [ Coughing ] Hey! That's great stuff. Really hurts the old lungs. It's a special concentration of cigarette smoke and exhaust fumes from city buses. [ Coughs ] You're my kind of genius. See, I told you old Sly Sludge could get rid of your toxic waste. With a little help from my brilliant associate MAL. If I could find a human this smart, I'd marry him. That's some ugly -- Uh, I mean, smart machine you got there. [ Beeping ] I'm not a machine. I'm an artificial intelligence, and you are a dimwit! Nice computer. Nice computer. You wouldn't pick on a dimwit, would you? No! Wait! Don't! Yeow! Ooh! Ooh! Yeow! My foot's burning up! So sorry about that, Sludge. Allow me. Huh? Watch what you say to MAL. He's very sensitive. MAL has penetrated the environmental agency's master computer. Every national park in the nation will be officially changed to a toxic waste dump. And that's just the beginning, right? Exactly. And MAL has predicted the end. Look. There will be 1,000 years cleaning up this mess. [ Laughs ] Oh, Wheeler, there is no time for sightseeing. I know. Whoa! We hit the rush-hour pigeon traffic. Scram, will you? Wind! We are supposed to protect the environment, not endanger it. Hey, I had the right of way... didn't I? Here's the environmental agency headquarters. We'll land over here in the park. Is it legal to park here? Hey, don't worry, babe. Why do you think they call it a park? ** Well, well, well. What can I do for you? We would like to see the main computer. Yeah. Both of us. [ Munching ] That's strictly off-limits to the public. But we are not public. We are Planet-- Shh. Chill, babe. I'll handle this. Your, uh, computer is malfunctioning. Listen, I'm in charge of the computer, and I know it's working fine. But it is letting an evil Man dump toxic waste in Yellowstone Park. [ Chuckles ] Nonsense. Please, you must believe us. Look, if you've got a problem, come back Monday and see my supervisor. Nyet! Monday will be too late. This guy's not gonna believe anything we say. We have to get inside and show him what's going on. How can we do that? Trust the old master. Hey, bud! Fire! Aah! Hey! What's going on here? This way. Whew! Made it. We ditched them. Here's the computer control center. Come on! After you, princess. Wow! Look at this. This computer's a lot fancier than my vid-game machine. [ Beeping ] Hey, do you have any idea what you're doing? I am punching up a status report. You mean you really know computers? You're a hacker! Of course. That's why I keep beating you at those foolish video games. These green squares are all the national parks. And those red dots are toxic waste dumps. Oh, it's worse than we feared. All the national parks have been changed into toxic waste dumps. How'd Sly Sludge pull this off? We got to do something. You'll do nothing. Arrest them for sabotage! Hey! Back off! We can explain. We are not trying to hurt your computer, only trying to fix it. That's right. We're Planeteers. The real villain is Sly Sludge. Somehow, he has got your computer to change all the national parks into dump sites. That's ridiculous. Check it out. Those darn Planeteers are going to spoil everything. Oh, relax. My cutie pie MAL has everything under control. Don't you, sweetums? The little darling can do anything he wants with their computer. Man: First, let's see about this Mr. Sly Sludge. "Sly Sludge, honorary chairman of the ecological defense foundation." No way! "Awarded the president's medal for his support of ecological improvement." I am not believing this. [ Beeping ] Now, about you Planeteers. Oh, interesting. The agency has quite a file on you-- notorious criminals engaged in illegal pollution. That's totally bogus, man. And as you can see, all the national parks are perfectly normal. Arrest them! Nyet! You cannot. We've got to find Sly Sludge and stop him. The only place you polluters are going is to prison! [ Handcuffs click ] Hey, you can't do this to us! We're U.S. taxpayers. At least I am. Save it for the judge. I hate polluters. [ Printer whirring ] Sorry, gentlemen, but we cannot let Sly Sludge get away with this. Wind! Huh? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Oh, no! Aah! Ugh! Now, that's what I call getting wrapped up in your work. Oh! What are you doing? We need the keys to the handcuffs. [ Handcuffs click ] All right. Let's go. Oof! You won't get away this time. Well, I-I... Run! Come back here! Now what, Wheeler? Quick! Up here! Linka, get us to the top floor. Wind! Huh? [ Straining ] We're too heavy. Must stop here. [ Both grunt ] [ Normal voice ] Sorry. Hey, any landing you can walk away from is a good one. [ Elevator bell dings ] Hey! They're headed for the first floor. First floor -- bureaucrats, red tape, Geo-Cruisers. Everybody out. [ Elevator bell dings ] Hey! Time to book, Linka! We can't go this way. And we cannot go back. Follow my lead, babe. Fire! Wind! [ Alarm rings ] [ All shouting ] Fire! Fire! We need help before Sludge really trashes the national parks. [ Gasps ] The environmental agency is impounding our Geo-Cruiser. I guess we shouldn't have parked there. We? Y said we could park it there. Now what do we do? Beats me, babe. Maybe -- maybe if we concentrate together, Ma-Ti will hear our thoughts. To concentrating is good, but this way. ** I cannot believe someone would deliberately do this. Ma-Ti, help! Ma-Ti, help! Kwame, Gi, quick. Ma-Ti, what is it? Wheeler and Linka are in trouble. [ Helicopter blades whir ] [ Insects chirping ] ** Lovely. All that toxic waste on its way to pollute the national parks. Yeah, doc. It sure is sweet. And the way you got it fixed, even them stupid Planeteers can't stop us. [ Laughs ] There's the Geo-Cruiser. The environmental agency was certainly the right place to start looking. But where are Linka and Wheeler? They can't be too far away. Kwame and I will search for them. I will keep watch here. It is hopeless. We do not even know where to begin to look. Ouch! Huh? Hey, dudes. Figured you'd show up sooner or later. Where is Ma-Ti? He's waiting for us at the Geo-Cruiser. You misunderstand. I am a Planeteer, a friend. [ Dog growls ] Oops! Now Ma-Ti is in trouble. Don't they understand he's a Planeteer? Yes, which is the problem. Their computer says all Planeteers are polluters. Kwame: The guard is going inside to report. Now is our opportunity. Wheeler: What opportunity? That watchdog looks mean. Heart! He's using his power. [ Dog growls ] [ Dog whimpers ] Good work, Ma-Ti. Our new friend here knows a secret way inside so you and Linka can fix the computer. The rest of us had better get to Yellowstone and stop Sly Sludge. What if we need Captain Planet? We'll keep in touch through Ma-Ti. Come on! [ Dog barks ] Didn't expect to find you here. Who let you two in? Oh, we have friends in high places. Not everyone believes the Planeteers are criminals. I'm not certain I do anymore. You were right. The computer has turned all the national parks into toxic waste dumps. Why do you not fix it? I tried! But I can't! An outside force has control of the computer. Our national parks are about to be destroyed, and no one can stop it! Rats! Those pesky Planeteers never give up. But then neither does Sly Sludge. Okay, drivers, step on it. Get ahead of the lead truck. I have an idea. ** Water! Don't stop! Who's afraid of a little mud puddle? [ Tires squealing ] It didn't work. The first truck got through the mud. Let me try. Earth! As they say in this country, "Here's mud in your eye." Man: Yeow! [ Tires squeal ] We did it! We blocked the road. Blast! Those Planeteers are becoming a real pain! Smash through. Oh, no! That truck is going over the edge! Ma-Ti: And the toxic waste with it! If we do not do something, that stuff will ruin the entire park forever. We need Captain Planet. I will try to reach Wheeler and Linka. Heart! [ Printer whirring ] Let our powers combine. Wheeler, our rings are glowing. Ma-Ti is calling us. We hear you, Ma-Ti. Let our powers combine. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Well, what have we here? Gaping gorge plus swerving semi equals trouble. Uh-oh. That truck will splatter toxic waste all over the mountainside. [ Grunts ] Way to go, Captain Planet. Off-road vehicles are not allowed in national parks. [ Grunts ] We definitely can't have that. And now for you, Mr. Sludge. But first I got to stop those toxic trucks. You're taking me for granite. [granted] [ Chuckles ] Time to rock and roll. [ Tires squeal ] Those trucks are not going anywhere. Now if only Wheeler and Linka can stop the computer. [ Printer whirring ] It's hopeless. Whatever's controlling the computer has superior logic. Duh! But can it cope with wild and crazy illogic? I got you, babe. It's big-game time with wild-man Wheeler as your host. Huh? Okay. MAL, what's going on? MAL: Something happening. Unable --  unable to compute. Random patterns,  extremely illogical. MAL, are you okay, baby? You poor, sweet thing. I've got a splitting  microchip ache. I'm losing control of the environmental agency's  computer. You did it! We have control of the computer again. What are you doing? Just sending a little message. Okay. You can return everything back to normal. Captain Planet: Whoa! Hold on there, partner. [ Grunts ] That's as far as you go, Sludge. Hey, ranger, arrest this busybody. I'm authorized to dump my load here. Not anymore you're not, toxic-head. The E.A. computer just took away your authority. Thanks for your help. I'll see that the waste is taken care of, as well as the waster. [ All grunting ] I've got it! I got it! Oof! I hope that Sludge and his computer cronies do not bother us again. Well, I know that computer won't. Just what was that last message you sent? [ Laughs ] I give you a hint. You've heard of computer virus? [ Coughs, sneezes ] MAL... what is it, baby? I seem to have caught a --  a virus. Oh, my, you're burning up. Don't go away, lambkin. I'll get you an ice pack. I'll -- I-I'll bring you a megabyte of chicken soup. It's too late. You can't get sick! What about our brilliant plan? I'm gonna take a couple  of Aspirin, and call you  in the morning, doctor. MAL, you can't do this to your mommy. MAL! Now you're making me sick. Quick! My air putrefier! I need some pollution! All: Go, Planet! The Planeteers want you to join them in keeping our planet clean, healthy, and beautiful. Don't litter. It's completely uncool. Please, put trash  in its place. Remember,  if everybody works together... All: We can clean up the world. The power is yours! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
