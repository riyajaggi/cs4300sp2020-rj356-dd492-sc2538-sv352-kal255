 ** And from South America --  Ma-Ti, with the power of heart. When the five powers combine, they summon  Earth's greatest champion -- Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: The power is yours! Happy 16th birthday, Junior! Oh, wow! Whoa! That's all you're going to say? This custom-built gas guzzler's got options! It's a convertible! It converts into a hot tub,

 a dance floor with a jukebox. Junior: Whoa, Dad! This is major cool! Not like that crummy bike you gave me last year. Oh, I'll be having a serious time tooling in this gem. Whoa! [ Engine roaring ] She's a real roadhog, Boss. Yup, yup! Hey, I want one of those. Where can I get one? Hmm... Given me another amazingly brilliant idea, Rigger. Way to go, Boss! Yup, yup! What? We'll steal a factory and build thousands of these babies. [ Snorting ] Thousands! Yup, yup. I know just the factory we can hijack. Man: Well, congratulations, Jane Goodair. In a few moments, the very first Goodair sedan will come off the assembly line. It can go miles on this one eye-dropper of gasoline. Your car is definitely the way to a cleaner, brighter future. Not if we can dirty things up. Rigger, get in there and do something to ruin that car. Like how, Boss? I don't care, bacon brain! Just make sure it comes out a lemon. And now what we've all been waiting for -- the first Goodair sedan. Crowd: Yay! Whoo-hoo! Miss Goody-Goody Goodair is in for a surprise! [ Engine whining ] Something's wrong. [ Crowd murmuring ] Sabotage. I knew it! I'll report this to the po-- [ Muttering ] Mr. Greedly has an offer you can't refuse. Yup, yup. [ Snorting ] So long, Goodair sedans. Hello, Greedly roadhogs! Planeteer alert! Wheeler: Oh, not another eco emergency, Gaia. Jane Goodair, the inventor, who makes fuel-efficient cars that fight smog, has disappeared. And Hoggish Greedly has taken over her company. Greedly? You must rescue Jane Goodair and stop Greedly's roadhogs from destroying the city. Let's airplane! It's "Let's jet," Linka, but "Let's airplane" is kind of cute, just like you. Watch over 6000 live TV channels for  less than 8 EUR - www.TvTodo.online Ma-Ti: "Only wimps and fools worry about smog. Be cool. Drive a roadhog." That is nonsense! Wheeler: Look at all those people waiting to buy roadhogs. Gi: They don't care what they breathe, just what they drive. [ Coughing ] Greedly: Next. They should call it "smogmobile," not roadhog. And all those people want one? How are we going to get by the guards? Easy. Get ready. Now! [ Guards coughing ] Look! There's Greedly! What's this junk? An emissions control device?! No one cares about smog control, hamhead! Options! Horsepower! That's what they care about! Fire up the furnaces and build those hogs! We better start looking for Jane Goodair. [ Coughing ] Oh! Uh! Oh! Oh! Wow! Uh! Hey there, Cutie Pie. Want to take a ride? [ Coughing ] You can rev my RPMs anytime, sweet thing. Do not touch me! The name's Junior... Hoggish Greedly, Jr. That hogwit's headed for the great pigsty in the sky. Wait, Wheeler. Let Linka keep him busy while we search for Jane Goodair. Good idea. Let us split up, okay? Huh? Look! A green scarf like Jane Goodair was wearing in the PlanetVision picture. Let's check that basement door. Dr. Goodair? Are you in there? [ Muffled speech ] We'll get you out. Fire! [ Footsteps approach ] Hey, what do you think you're doing? Huh? It's the nature nerds. Okay, Planeteers, I'm going to retire you. Oh! Oh! Uh! Uh! [ Alarm sounds ] Uh! Uh! Hey, you! [ Whistle blows ] Ma-Ti: We are trapped! Quick, Ma-Ti. Come on! Together: Ugh! Huh? Hey! I got the biggest car on the road. You got to take a ride in it, doll. I do not ride with strangers. [ Smooches ] Please! Kwame: Jump! Oh! Linka: Thank you, my friends. Ugh! We were just looking for a soft place to land. Come on! Let us find the others! Greedly: My idea exactly. Fun's over, ecobrats. Rigger! Smog-blast them! [ Coughing ] Wind! [ Coughing ] Turn it up! [ Coughing ] Linka: The smog stopped my power! Lock 'em up, Rigger. I'm sure you ecotwerps and Dr. Goody-Two Shoes will have lots to talk about. [ Snorting ] Uh! Wheeler! Gi! Dr. Goodair! All right, lamebrains! Back to work! I want this factory on 24-hour shifts. Quadruple the roadhog output! [ Coughing ] But your cars are ruining the air. The smog is getting worse. Hee hee hee! [ Snorts ] If you don't like what I'm doing to the air, then don't breathe it. Yup, yup! You're all washed up, Planeteers! You thought you could save Dr. Goodair, but you can't even save yourselves! Ha ha ha! Wheeler: Okay. Stand back! Fire! My ring won't melt this metal! Goodair: Nothing will. I had this room triple fortified to keep anyone from breaking in and stealing my car designs. I never thought Greedly would steal my whole factory! Don't worry, Dr. Goodair. We'll get your factory back for you. Somehow. [ Door opens ] Someone is coming! Junior? [ All coughing ] [ Door slams ] Linka? Where's Linka? Hey, calm down. We're just going for a little drive. Usually I don't use seat belts, but this time is an exception. [ Coughing ] Don't go anywhere, dollface. [ Coughing ] 2,200 bucks?! No way I'm spending that on a lousy hunk of glass. Flowers! Girls dig flowers! [ Coughing ] Here, doll. Hey, what's this black stuff? [ Blows ] [ Coughing ] Remind me to write City Hall and tell them to dust their flowers. [ Coughing ] [ Tires squeal ] "Blimp Burger ring." Free with any Blimp Burger! Gee, I'm kind of hungry. I got you something real special -- a priceless engagement ring. Okay, time to trade in that plain old ring you're wearing for something with a little class. Linka: No! My Planeteer ring! Do you know what you have done? [ Speaking Russian ] I must get my ring back. Oh, I love it when you talk like that. More, please! More! Tell me more. Absolutely not! No way! Take me back to the factory at once! Come on! In my roadhog, I'm completely irresistible! Ha ha ha! [ Coughing ] Are you okay? Junior? [ Coughing ] Junior! Junior, wake up! If only I could reach... that button. Uh! Uh! Good. [ Wheezing ] You need help fast. [ Coughing ] Everybody is sick from the roadhog smog. We've got to help them. You've bought yourself the perfect car, friend. Next. What happened? Junior! What have you done to my beautiful baby boy? My namesake! It is what you and your smog hogs have done. Look at the air he is breathing. Junior! Junior, boy! Wake up! Don't just stand there! We need help! Call Captain Planet! I cannot. Junior threw my Planeteer ring away, and without all 5 rings... You can't call Captain Planet? I'll do anything! Just help my son! People all over this city are dropping like flies. It is not just Junior! Please help him! And money is no object. Well, to find the ring, first we need a way to detect it. I can use my heart power to find it. Good. Then we'll need a vehicle that can go through the sewer system fast. I'll need help building it. All: You've got it! Wheeler: On one condition, Greedly. You have to give the factory back to Dr. Goodair. Yes, yes! Anything! Just save my Junior. He's too handsome to die. Goodair: That should do it. Wheeler: Fire! Ohh... Water! What are we waiting for? Let's go! Cross your fingers, guys. We need luck. This city needs more than luck. It needs Captain Planet! To the left, Gi! And I thought surfing was exciting! To the right! We are closer! Back that way, Gi. Quick! Go back! Whoa! Gi: Hey, that was fun! Together: Uh-oh! Aah! Heart! [ Beeping ] Uh! Ma-Ti, we got to get out of here! Shh! The ring is very close. It's not the ring that worries me. Water! Ahh... What is keeping Gi and Ma-Ti? [ Wheezing ] My Junior's getting worse! [ Horns honking ] Hold on, Ma-Ti! Oh, no! Here we go! Linka, here is your ring. Quick, everyone! Up to the roof! Kwame: Let our powers combine! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! [ Coughing ] Greedly's setting a new world's record in smog pollution. Is it too late to save the city? It will be a tough job, even for someone with my electric personality. My electrostatic charge will attract the solid smog particles. Yech! Talk about a bad case of soot in mouth! [ Coughing ] This is really exhausting! Uh! No wonder this stuff makes for heavy breathing! Now, here's what's really shocking. It may not look like much in the air, but this is what goes into your lungs. Way to go, Cap! I was scared even you couldn't handle this one. Greedly: So was I. I can breathe, Dad. We should thank Captain Planet. He saved my life. [ Clears throat ] Um... thank you, Captain Planet. Say what? I said, "Thank you." You got a hearing problem? Some thanks. You just saved this entire city. [ Engine rumbling ] I wish it were that simple, Wheeler. As long as these smog hogs are on the road, the air's going to be dirty -- real dirty! [ Coughs ] And speaking of dirt, I feel wiped out. Time to go recover. Catch you later. The power is yours! All: Goodbye, Captain Planet! Dr. Goodair, could I turn in my Greedly roadhog for a Goodair sedan? What? My own son, a traitor? When I reopen my factory, Junior, you'll get the first one off the assembly line. Hey, Dad. What do you say? [ Snorting ] Ready for a Goodair sedan? Or better yet -- a bicycle! [ Snorting ] Gi: Great idea, Junior! How can I pollute on a bicycle? All in favor of making Junior an honorary Planeteer, say, "Aye." All: Aye! It's just a bad dream. None of this is really happening. Yeah, it's a nightmare, right? Right? Wrong! Face it, Dad. You're living in the past... and the future belongs to all us Planeteers! All: Go, Junior! Planeteers: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: Some people want to drive the biggest car on the road. Gi: And large cars use up large amounts of gas, and that means more air pollution. But no matter what size a car is, it's important to keep it tuned up. Cars that are not cared for make the smog problem even greater. Avoid the hog and the smog. The power is yours! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
