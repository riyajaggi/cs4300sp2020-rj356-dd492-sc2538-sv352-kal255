 Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990â€“1996): Season 1, Episode 24 - Two Futures: Part 1 - full transcript 
 Hoggish Greedly prepares to enter Dr. Blight's time pool to travel back to the 1950s where he can profit through development as much as he pleases without having to worry about environmental policies. The Planeteers track down their cave in Greenland, and though Captain Planet slows down Greedly and Rigger, Wheeler's pursuit of them near the pool separates him from the others when a sound-wave machine causes an ice-fall. Cap is weakened by radiation and must depart, and the others can't see an easy way to get through the blockade. Bitter about being trapped in a carbon-dioxide-filled chamber with Dr. Blight when he could be celebrating a New Year's Eve party, Wheeler admits that this is one of those times he regrets becoming a Planeteer. Blight offers to let him stop their imprisonment by having him go back in time and undo that. Wheeler gives the date and location, but is reluctant to actually go until Blight pushes him through the pool. Going 360 days back in time to New York, Wheeler catches the Fire ring meant for himself and warns him to refuse it since it's fatal. His past self agrees and flees, but then Wheeler is confronted by Gaia, who tells him that he changed history in more ways than he thought. Greedly was never stopped from going back in time himself, so global warming is now much worse thanks to his decades' worth of polluting. The Planeteers never formed without their fifth member, and Captain Planet could not be summoned without the Ring of Fire. Wheeler doubts this can be true, since others might have been chosen in his place. Gaia takes him forward 35 years through MAL's time-pool system, where he finds New York flooded from global warming...

 Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand  the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five magic rings  to five special young people -- Kwame from Africa,  with the power of Earth. [ Sirens wailing ] From North America -- Wheeler,  with the power of fire. ** From the Soviet Union -- Linka,  with the power of wind. From Asia -- Gi,  with the power of water.

 ** And from South America --  Ma-Ti, with the power of heart. When the five powers combine, they summon  Earth's greatest champion -- Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: The power is yours! [ Wind howling ] Greedly: Behold the future site of Greedly's Greenland Estates, the world's most expensive beach resort. [ Laughs, snorts ] Rigger: Beach resort? The place is covered with ice, Mr. Greedly! I can make a silk purse out of this sow's ear.

 We'll warm up the Earth till this place is as hot as the tropics! Oh, I get it. After the ice melts, you can sell your land for a fortune, boss. Yep, yep! But what about the Planeteer punks? Yes, nowadays, they have everyone squealing about the environment. But what if we could go back in time, before there were Planeteers? You mean you can time-travel? Well, I can't hog all the credit, but my piggy bank financed Dr. Blight's newest invention. I call it the Somewhere-In-Time Pool. [ Beeping ] MAL:  Oh, don't let us get poetic. It's just a time machine. Why, MAL, darling, you're jealous just because you didn't invent a doorway to the past and future. If I did, it would reach further  than a measly 50 years. Just send us back to the 1950s -- no pollution laws, no Planeteers, and no Captain Planet! We'll burn all the coal and oil we can find! Permit me to show you  what will happen if you go and do that. Your burning will release  tons of carbon dioxide into the air. The sunlight that would  normally bounce back into space as heat will be trapped by the increased  carbon dioxide. It's like rolling up  the windows on a car  parked in the sun. Or like a greenhouse. We know that, MAL. That's why it's called the greenhouse effect. After a few years, this global warming  will melt the polar ice, raising the sea level  all over the world, changing weather,  making storms worse. In short,  by changing the past, you will wreck  the future. So? Wrecking the future is what I do best. And I'll make a fortune! MAL, please stop wasting time. Warm up our nuclear power source for the time pool. Well,  you did say please. [ Machinery powers up ] Starting tachyon flow. [ Machinery whirring ] [ Beeping ] [ Pool hums ] [ Beeping ] [ Humming continues ] You will make history, Greedly, as the first time traveler! [ Beeping ] Make history, nothing. I'm going to  rewrite history! And there won't be any Planeteers in it! [ Laughs ] [ Radio plays ] Wheeler: I'm going to show you guys a real New-York-Style New Year's bash! As long as we avoid those Times Square crowds. Wheeler, maybe you should give up this party idea. Da. It is not very practical. I would rather be out stopping polluters. Come on, guys! We deserve a holiday. Planeteers,  to the Crystal Chamber. Huh? I hate to be a party pooper, but we have  an eco-emergency. Oh, no! Not on New Year's Eve! Gaia: Dr. Blight has created her most dangerous invention in an underground lab in Greenland. Dr. Blight again? Even mad scientists call her crazy! What is she up to now? She's going to send Hoggish Greedly back in time to speed up global warming. Chort vozmi! Earth is already warming up too fast! That's why you must stop them. But we'll miss my party. Why us? Why not send in the Army or something? This is a job for Planeteers. We will do it, Gaia! Hurry, Wheeler. Hey! Scratch one New Year's party. We'll never be back by midnight. If Greedly changes history, it will not be a happy New Year! ** This has to be the place. Well, unless we want to get out the shovels and dig, I'd better use fire! We don't want to swim, either. Water! Come on! Whoa! Ma-Ti! Aah! Aah! Whoa! Help! Aah! [ All screaming ] [ Screaming continues ] Wow! When this is all over, I want to do that again! Look! That must be the laboratory. But there is no door! I will make one! Earth! [ Beeping ] MAL: All right.  We're ready. [ All gasp ] [ Rumbling ] Gee, this time pool can sure make waves, don't you think, boss? Don't ya? That's not the time pool. That's... The Planeteers? We knocked, but no one answered. [ Ray gun powers up ] Here's your answer, my little eco-darlings! I call it my sonic boom box! [ Laughs ] Ahh. [ Warbling ] Oh! Oh! Oh! Her weapon uses sound waves! That is what I call noise pollution! It may be noise pollution to you, planet brats, but it's music to my ears! Ow! Aah! Look out! [ Warbling continues ] It's shaking the ice loose! Time for teamwork! Let our powers combine! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! Planeteers: Go, Planet! Hey, doc, Looks like your music is really bringing down the house. This little piggy's going home! Wait! Are y-you sure this thing's safe? A-Are you? Not really. That's why you're going first! I don't want to be no guinea pig while you get to be a chicken. What did you mean by that? [ Gulps ] N-N-Nothing personal, b-boss. I'll keep them busy! Hurry up and jump! Do you take requests? [ Gasps ] How about the sounds of silence? [ Warbling stops ] [ All gasp ] Captain Planet, look out! The whole ceiling is giving way! Dr. Blight's evil plan isn't all it's cracked up to be. What are Rigger and Greedly up to? Who cares if you belly flop? Dive! Whoa! Stop! [ All grunt ] I'm out of here! Yep! Yep! Come back here, you traitor! ** Wheeler! It's a cave-in! [ Gasps ] Out of my way, Rigger! I'm splitting! I think I can pick up this split. Yes! A spare! All right! Please spare us! Oh, my aching bacon! [ Gasps ] ** [ Beeping ] ** Captain Planet, we're trapped in here! Yes, please get us out, Captain Planet! I promise I'll be good from now on. I'll tell any lie I can think of to get out of here. We have got to rescue Wheeler! I can dig it! Ugh! [ Grunts ] Aah! Just like a superhero. When you really need him, he flakes out on you. Your time machine's nuclear power source contaminated the ice! [ Sizzling ] Captain Planet, are you all right? Stay back, Ma-Ti. There's radioactivity here. It's weakening... my powers. [ Sizzling ] You mean you cannot rescue Wheeler? But he will run out of air in there! Ugh! Oh! Ugh! [ Beeping ] [ Straining ] That nuclear radiation is draining my powers. We cannot just leave Wheeler in there to die! With friends like you, he still has a fighting chance. For now... the power is yours. Ha! [ Snorts ] You may have stopped us from time-traveling, but you'll never save your pal's hide. Let me try. Earth! [ Rumbling ] No! It will cause a cave-in and crush them! Wheeler! [ Beeping ] It's been over an hour. Looks like your hero has abandoned you. [ Yawns ] It was your radioactivity that took away Cap's powers. [ Yawns ] This is the most boring New Year's Eve I've ever spent. Boredom's not  making you yawn. It's carbon dioxide. What? You mean we're running out of oxygen? Not we, human. You. I never use the stuff. Then this is it. Game over. [ Yawns ] Stop yapping. All your heavy breathing is using up our oxygen faster. It's not fair! This is what I get for trying to save the world? I could have been having fun tonight. Sometimes I wish I'd never gotten this stupid ring. Do you really mean that? Because I can arrange it. Arrange what? I can send you back in time to the moment when you got that ring from Gaia. When was that, anyway? Uh...last January. The 5th. You heard that, MAL. Start up the time pool. Wheeler's going back in time... to January 5th. And where were you that day? Brooklyn, New York, but I really don't want to go back in time. [ Time pool whirring ] Aren't you tired of being a Planeteer, of always recycling, carpooling, saving energy? It's what everybody should do. Forget "should." Isn't it time you did what you want to do. But changing history, I don't know. There are billions of other people who can fight pollution. You've got your own life to worry about. I don't trust you, Blight. Then think about this -- Our only way out of this cave-in is to change history so it didn't happen. I guess that makes sense. So, go! Aaaah! So long, sucker. Aaaah! Ugh! Hey, where am I? And when am I? Ha ha ha! [ Gasps ] [ Laughs ] Wait a minute. I remember this. I made it. I've gone back in time. [ Siren wailing ] [ Laughs ] Huh? Wha? Yah! Yeow! Ow! Wha? That's me before I became a Planeteer. ** No! Hey, what's the big -- Whoa! You look just like me. Who are you? I am you, not too long from now. What are you talking about? I came back in time to warn you. Don't accept this ring. This ring is going to kill us! Leave it alone. Time-travel, huh? Why should I believe all this? I'm here, aren't I? Yeah, I guess so. Right. Now, get out of here. Go! Gee, that was easy. [ Thunder crashes ] [ Wind howling ] Aah! Oh! Hey! [ Electricity crackling ] [ Wind howls ] My Planeteer insignia, it's gone! I did it! Whoa! Whoa! Gaia, what's the deal? You scared the freckles off of me. Wheeler, what have you done? I stopped being a Planeteer so I wouldn't die in an ice cave. That's all. No, that's not all. You've changed history. Look! Yeah. It's hot. And it was cold a minute ago. Wait a second. How could I change the weather? All I did was quit the Planeteers. Yes, you quit, so you weren't there to keep Greedly out of the time pool. He and Rigger went back in time to the 1950s, back before there were any pollution laws. Greedly built huge factories to burn fuels wastefully. Rigger: Going back to the '50s was a stroke of genius, boss. No one worries about ecology back here. Yeah, we can burn fossil fuels like there's no tomorrow. And at this rate, there won't be a tomorrow. [ Laughs, snorts ] Yeah, boss. Ha ha! I don't get it. Gaia: They released so much carbon dioxide that now the Earth is much hotter. Why didn't Captain Planet stop them? Captain Planet does not exist. You changed history. You never joined the Planeteers, so there are no Planeteers. They each went their own separate way. Oh, come on, Gaia. You could have found someone else to be a Planeteer instead of me. No. Each individual has a unique role to play. You were supposed to set an example for countless others. [ Scoffs ] I don't buy it. Other people will take up the slack. If we were on Hope Island, I could show on the PlanetVision how wrong you are. But if you believe your actions don't have an affect, why don't you step into the 21st century and see what the world will be like. All right, I will. I hate to use a dangerous device like the time pool. But you leave me no choice. MAL, send Wheeler into the future. Oh, really?  And what if I refuse? You're right near the North Pole. What if the Earth's magnetic field suddenly gets a lot more powerful? [ Electricity crackling ] Wait! Ouch! Stop! Don't! The magnetism  will erase my data. Ow! [ Clicks tongue ]  All right, I'll do it. No need  to get geophysical. Send Wheeler to this same neighborhood 35 years from now. But he can only stay  for one hour. Then he must return  to real time. Man, I'll see all the progress, the new inventions. This is excellent! We'll see if you like what you find. Future, here I come. Yee-haw! Whoa! Hey, what is this? This can't be my neighborhood. Then again, it does look familiar. Aah! [ Gasping ] If I don't find some land, I'm going to drown. Uh-oh! Aah! Ugh! That was close. I almost didn't make it. Now where am I? Oh, no! I'm on the Statue of Liberty. It can't be. New York City is underwater? What happened to my home? What happened to the world? Gaia, where are you?! Planeteers: Go, Planet! ** The future of Earth rests in all our hands. Please, don't waste water. [ Radio plays ] Please, do not waste energy. [ All coughing ] please, don't waste your minds and bodies. Please, don't waste our future. The power is yours! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
