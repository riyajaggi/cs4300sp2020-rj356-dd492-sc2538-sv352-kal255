 Subtitles by wadera8@wp.pl. THE AGENDA - PART TWO Enter. You wanted to see me? I did. I don't know how long this has been going on, but it stops right now, understand? I am not certain to what you are referring. I'm talking about you and a certain female Predacon. Or am I wrong? Tell me I'm wrong and I'll apologize right now. Hmm?

 Well, that's just prime. Sir, I believe I can bring her around. Don't be an IDIOT! She may have been made from Maximal parts but she is a Predacon to the core! As was I once... YOU didn't KNOW better! Silverbolt, you are one of the noblest individuals I have ever met. That is your strength. It is also your weakness. Blackarachnia is USING you! I do not believe that, sir. Whether you believe it or not is immaterial. The fact remains that your emotions have jeopardize our situationfar more than you realize. If we weren't holding Megatron...

 You're confined to quarters. I'll send Cheetor to bring in the spider-woman. Sir! You have something else to say, Silverbolt? Sir! Optimus... I believe that Blackarachnia will not hurt me. But she would have no such compunction about Cheetor. For his sake if no other, please. Send me instead. I will bring her in. You're confined to quarters, Silverbolt. Cheetor. Report to me at once. So. The Tripredacus Council still smooches the skidplates of the Maximal Elders... Is it any wonder I rebelled? The Predacons will have their moment. But you? I served under the original Megatron. You have his name, but not his army. Perhaps. But what does it matter, if your ship is too Energon-depleted by battle to return to Cybertron. The Maximals... Have nothing. They were expecting rescue. I, on the other hand, have a secret store of Energon cubes, yess. Release me... and it is yours. I think I will take it anyway. Its location is encrypted. And my minons have fled. Remember the defense shutdown that triggered your capture? Yess. How did you...? Permit me to introduce: Lieutenant Tarantulas of the Predacon Secret Police! A mole! Within my own organization all this time! And I never suspected. Energon cache located, Covert Agent Ravage. I'll have the Maximals retrieve it right away. Yes. You do that. On my way, Big Bot! Aw right! Uh... Silverbolt? Yes? Uh... I just kinda wanted t'say. I'm sorry about all this... and I promise I'll - I'll bring her in with... minimal damage, okay? That is very considerate of you, Cheetor. And I am sorry too. Sorry? For what? For this! Cheetor! How do you feel!? Whoa! Li'l dizzy... but... I'll be okay... Then I am again sorry. Wha...? Hey! Why ya sucker-punchin' spaniel! I useta be young like that. What!? I mean we got trouble! Oh yeah. Trouble with a capital "B"! How's the head? More fatheaded than fractured, Big Bot. Man, I'm a cat! I oughta know better than t'trust a dog! Silverbolt believed he was acting in your best interests. Yeah? Well I look forward t' returning th' favor! KaPow! There's the cave. Let's get that energon. The sooner we get Megatron off this planet the better. Awww, MAN! What is it? Th' energon's here, but it's RAW! Eh? No good for us... Megabrain musta made a mistake. Not if I know Megatron. Weapons online, Cheetor! Prepare to fall back! What!? Eh, what is this? By Royal Command! Whata...? Ma'm, pull this vehicle over... please. No! Get out of here! I'm busy! Very well then, prepare to be boarded. And you can prepare to be blown away if you don't leave! Blackarachnia, I want you to return with me to the Maximals. Get a clue, you canine cretin! I'm a Predacon! I'm evil! I'll shoot you! No. My heart tells me that you will not. Oh yeah? You shot me! No duh, dogboy! I'm evil! Now do you believe me? And yet... you ensured the wound would not be mortal. Your inner Maximal goodness prevented... SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP! I know how you're feeling. You don't know whether to kiss me or kill me. I'm a black widow spider, you idiot! I can do both! Waspinator has reached coordinates. But where is... Oh no, you're not saving my life again? Even after I shot you? It's my duty, m'am. As a Maximal, and as a Heroic Character. You know, I like 'em big and stupid, but you're really pushing it. Look! He's got Energon buildup! For... the... ROYALTY! Cheetor! It's gonna blow! This is Optimus Primal calling Ravage! Come in! So. It was a trap. Oh no. Really? You are a piece of work. Even imprisoned, you still operate your own agenda. I am not naive. You have no intention of returning me - - or any of us - - to Cybertron alive. That is true. But your crew is scattered and I want no witnesses. Still - - why should I tolerate your existence any longer? Did you ever wonder why I stole the Golden Disk in the first place? You were looking for Energon. That was a bonus. It allowed me to recruit a crew, and gave potential for power. But the real reason was this. The Golden Disk was launched from Earth aboard the Voyager Spacecraft just as the secret war between the Autobots and Decepticons began. The original Megatron - your commander had every intention of winning. But like myself, he covered his bets. He inscribed a secret message into the Golden Disk. A message which I myself discovered and decoded. I am expected to believe you? You said yourself the disk was destroyed. Arm autoguns. Target the prisoner. Targeting. Release the powerbonds. The disk was destroyed. But a fragment remains. And I am not expecting YOU to believe ME. This is Megatron, leader of the Decepticons. And if you are hearing this, it means I failed - - this time. But I know that Transwarp technology is being developed. And so I leave this message to any Decepticon descendants that may find-may find - may find... Autoguns offline. Retract bars. Complying. Now. Let us talk. Not fair. Waspinator minding own business when BANG gets whole stasis pod right up the kazooty... It doesn't make sense. It appears someone dug this tunnel, and then blasted it shut. This give you any clue? Megatron? Got it in one. Now why don't you haul your hero hiney out of here? I don't recall inviting you to the picnic. I will not leave without you. It's dangerous. Probably a trap. Aha! Your inner Maximal goodness shows concern! Thaaaat's it. Vital circuits this time! My apologies. I won't call your bluff. Then you'll leave? Not without you. Aaaargh! All right, then make yourself useful. See that big boulder right there? Think you can take it out? Stand back, citizen! Optimus to Maximal Base. What is your status? Report. Well, I got good news an' bad news, Fearless Leader. All right, what's the good news? Well, th' GOOD news is we don't haveta kowtow t'that stinkin' Decepticon any longer. And the bad news? Th' BAD news is - - he's switched sides! DECEPTICONS FOREVER!
