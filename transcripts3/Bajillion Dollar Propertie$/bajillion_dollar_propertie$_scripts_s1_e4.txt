 Dean: You're not correct. It's darkest when it's dark. That's when it's the darkest. Andrew: No. It's darkest when it's darker than dark. Dean: And when is that? Andrew: I don't know, but sometimes at night, you can be like, "Oh, it's night. It's pretty dark." And then sometimes you're at night, and you're like, "Whoa, it got darker." Baxter: Yeah. The stars are out. There's the moon out, and it's pretty bright. Dean: How does this relate to sales? Why are you not selling more? Victoria: Well, I think it's pretty obvious. Baxter: Why?

 Victoria: Because you guys are idiots. Baxter: People like that. Dean: Is this true? Baxter: People like the approachability... of not knowing much information. You don't want to seem above them. Andrew: Nah. We ask them a lot of of questions. What kind of house is this? Do you know how much it costs? Uh, how many rooms does it have? Baxter: Did you happen to count the bedrooms? We haven't been upstairs yet. In fact, we have bought houses from clients. Dean: That is, at best, counterproductive. And has this led to any sales? Andrew: It did lead to a sale. Baxter: Mm-hmm. Dean: Which sale was that? Andrew: We sold our Schwinn. Dean: You shared a bike? ♪♪ Chelsea: Showing a property to one of Victoria's clients is like taking candy from a baby, a baby that swears and wears way too much makeup. You know, I am no chef, but I love a stainless chef's kitchen, right? Shoshua: Mm-hmm. Speaking of chef, I have a question for you. Shoshua: What's your name again, sweetheart? -Chelsea: I'm Chelsea. -Shoshua: Chelsea. -Chelsea: Yeah. -Shoshua: Shoshua. Chelsea: Shoshua, yay. -Shoshua: What is your gumbo? -Chelsea: My... Shoshua: What are the flavors that make this beautiful you-fle? Clearly, there's some African in there, and it's hot. It's beautiful. Is there some Asian, too? Chelsea: You know, I actually don't know. My parents didn't believe in labels, so... Shoshua: Can I... Mm-hmm. There's some Asian in there. Victoria: Did you taste something? Shoshua: [ Laughs ] Chelsea: He tasted me. Ah. Victoria: Shoshua is a horrifying vagina scarecrow, but he's rich, and I want that commission. Shoshua: These floors, this is concrete and this is...

Well, then you're in the right place. Let's get started. If Glenn is truly Dean's bastard son, then he's my golden ticket to the partnership. I'm gonna take this boy under my wing and Yaghoob all over him. Thank you all for being here. I really appreciate it. Here we go. Point number one is believe in it. I'm talking about believe like you've never believed before, okay? Glenn: Uh, well, I was raised Catholic, so... Amir: Just give me a yes or a no. -Glenn: Oh, yes. -Amir: Well, take that belief and throw it down the toilet. Next, achieve. Whatever you got to do, you do to achieve. You call your mom and tell her to go fuck herself if you have to. You take a baby, and you throw it off the top of a building if you have to. Hold on. It's okay. No, you don't have to really throw a baby off the building. Glenn: I don't want to tell my mom to fuck off. I don't have any other family. Amir: Let's just keep going. And what's the next thing you do? You bechieve! That's me, jumping and clicking my heels for the first time in my life. You know why? Because I bechieved that I could do it, and I did do it, Glenn.

Yes, I've got just a little bit of time for questions, comments, accolade. Yes, the middle-aged lesbian in the front. Glenn: Okay, pretty good. Uh, that was an incredible lecture. Amir: Thank you very much. That's all the time we have. And remember, if you want to achieve, if you want to believe, then you can... Glenn: Bechieve it. Amir: Bechieve it. [ Glenn claps ] Glenn: Wow. That was incredible. He showed me who I am and who I could be. Not bad for three grand. ♪♪ Andrew: [ Barks ] We're on our way to see a 1920s Bel Air estate. Baxter: I looked it up on Zillow. The zestimate is $9.2 million, and zat's not too zabby. Andrew: If we can list this estate, it'll pull us out of our slump. Baxter: And make us a shoe-in for the partnership. Andrew: This place is crazy. -Baxter: Don't touch that. -Andrew: Somebody did that. Baxter: They'll follow you home. Those things follow you home. Andrew: I know, remember? We don't go to the American Doll store anymore. Baxter: Plus, we're banned. I stole Samantha's horse-riding kit. Andrew: Mm-hmm. [ Wheelchair wheels squeaking ] Hello. Mrs. Gulliver: [ Wheezes ] Baxter: She can't breathe. Andrew: It's an absolute pleasure to meet you. Butler: Presenting Mrs. Gulliver. Andrew: This feels like the part of a horror movie where we run out of gas. Baxter: Yeah, and then we ask for help at the murder house.

For her to choose you, two fit, strapping boys such as yourself must woo her. -Andrew: Oh. -Butler: And woo her well. Andrew: Woo her? Oh, this'll be easy. Baxter: We are great with old ladies.

So that one's a no. -Andrew: It's in the tone? -Baxter: Okay. Andrew: A beautiful cup of tea for a beautiful woman. -Gulliver: [ Slurps ] Andrew: Oh, my God. This is taking forever. Baxter: Honestly, I feel like she's died and come back to life twice in the last 10 minutes. Andrew: Uh, Mrs. Gulliver, how much are you looking to sell the property for? Do you have a figure in mind? Butler: $75 billion. Andrew: $75 billion. Uh...okay. Well, we can work with... Baxter: I think that's a little high. Butler: Oh. Ah, $17,000. Andrew: Okay.

Chelsea: Yeah, I think it's actually really streamlined. It's my favorite space. -Shoshua: You know what? I have a confession to make with you guys. I feel like I haven't been honest. -Victoria: No? -Shoshua: No. I feel like maybe I've been kind of joking around about something I'm very serious about. And that's having sex with both of you. Chelsea: [ Gags ] People I'd have sex with before Shoshua -- all of the people. Shoshua: In my experience, if I persist... -Victoria: Okay, no, no. -Shoshua: ...and I persist... and I persist, I get what I want. Chelsea: Let's just all go back inside.
