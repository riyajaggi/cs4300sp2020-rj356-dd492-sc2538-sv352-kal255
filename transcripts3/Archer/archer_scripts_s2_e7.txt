 Archer (2009–…): Season 2, Episode 7 - Movie Star - full transcript 
 Oscar winning actress, Rona Thorne, is taking on the CIA and the KGB in Deitrich Viener's new movie thriller, "Disavowed!" Since Rona wants her performance to be amazing, Rona wants to train not only with ISIS, but with Lana Kane. Rona says she is SO inspired by Lana, the epitome of an empowered woman! Lana hesitates about sharing highly classified covert ops with anyone outside the agency, but when Archer offers his services, Lana immediately agrees to work with Rona. Meanwhile, Malory takes advantage of the access to Rona's Hollywood agent and Cyril; this results in a taut, sexy thriller-sequel to "Mandingo." Pam borrows something from Rona and tells Cheryl and Ray. It is an "Operation Dick Sledge," flashback at Rona's apartment; Steele and Cassius find their own Pinch Two and experience jungle fever at ISIS. Surprisingly, absolutely no one but Archer and the computer nerds seem to be paying attention to current events; Archer is the only one who is not totally starstruck. Will it be bawk, bawk! therapy cranes for Ray, Pam and Cheryl? Does Granny get her groove back? Will Cyril ever return to his self-help meetings? Archer's diligent attention to business and/or revenge could be the key to success on this mission. Or, will Archer and Lana be totally fugu-ed?

 She's battled ivory poachers, raging rivers, even tuberculosis. And now, Oscar-winner Rona Thorne takes on the CIA and the KGB... ...in Dietrich Viener's new thriller, Disavowed. Oh, my God. It's going to be amazing. I play a spy accused of being a double agent... ...so she has to clear her name. I read Dietrich's script, I was like: "Look at me." I was like, "Whoa!" Ha, ha. So it's going to be amazing. PAM: Oh, my God, she's amazing. - Eh, I don't know. - Because you're an idiot. Who obviously never saw River's Rage. .

 I saw it, but I was like, "Eh..." Wha...? Are you nuts? That scene where her baby gets swept away? Bawled so hard they made me leave, never saw the ending. - Well, they find the baby... - Aah! Don't tell me. [CHERYL GASPS] - Dead. - Damn it. Jammed up under a log. Oh, and that wet clingy shirt she wears the whole time? Nippletown. Oh, my God, that river was so cold. [ALL SCREAMING] - Why are we screaming? - Do you know who you are? I do. Ha, I do, I do, I do. I'm supposed to be meeting Malory Archer, so...

 Come in, dear. Come in. The rest of you, don't you have something better to do... ...than stand around all day and shriek? - No. - Nope. - I'm sorry. That sounded like no. - Lana, she has to research her role. This isn't the sheriff's department... ...where you wear a windbreaker and go on a ride-along. - This is highly classified covert ops. - Yes. Covert ops. This is exactly the kind of spy lingo I wanna soak up. What part of "highly classified" do you not understand? All of it. That's why I'm here doing research, so you can teach me. Which she'll be happy to do. Wait a minute. What are you getting out of this? Nothing. Well, apart from a small consideration from the studio. LANA: Uh-huh. - Which we're still negotiating, but... - Who's your agent, by the way? - He's not taking new clients. And, Lana, please, you have to, have to, have to help me. - I don't, don't, don't. And I'm not... ARCHER: Not really qualified. - I'm sorry? - It's not your fault, Lana. I, on the other hand, am qualified... ...since I happen to be the world's greatest secret agent. - Uh, but you're a man. - And then some. LANA: So, obviously, he can't give you... ...a woman's perspective like I can. - So, yes, I will be happy to help you. - What? [IN SINGSONG VOICE] Oh, my God, this is gonna be amazing. - You're just doing this to spite me. - And? I should be teaching Rona Thorne how to be a secret agent, not Lana. "Woman's perspective." I mean... ...l'm so obviously the best agent. Duh. How could she pick Lana over me? The mind fairly boggles. - Exactly. Wait, was that sarcasm? - No, sir. Oh, good, because your opinion matters. And since you seem unclear on the concept... ...that was sarcasm. - Well played, sir. - Thank you. Thank you. LANA: The minute this interferes... ...with my real assignments, we are finished. Oh, my God, totally. Yes. I mean, I'm just acting, but your work is so... So vital. - It is, but... - Don't do that. I am so... Look at me, I am so inspired by you. Wow, l... Really? Oh, my God, you're like the epitome of an empowered woman. If I can bring even one-tenth of your strength... ...and sexiness to my character... Oh, my God. PAM: Ha, ha, you're kidding. - And just what exactly is so funny? - Uh, it's just... - It's hard to picture you as a young actress. - For your information... PAM: A young anything. My acting career... Shut up. - Was really taking off. I was on my way to a callback for a TV commercial... ...doing the crossword on the 41 bus and a man leans over and says: "If you like puzzles, I may have a job for you." And guess who he was. PAM & CHERYL: Wild Bill Donovan. - Wild Bill Donovan, head of the OSS. Three weeks later I was in Tunisia, killing a man. But I always wondered, what if I had gotten that commercial? Guess that Tunisian guy would still be alive. He was German. And this character, Gerald Martin, the CIA director... Why couldn't that be Geraldine Martin? No, no, that's awful. Uh... Ooh. Malory! But not Martin, something like Steele, because she's a very strong woman who... Who will remember that at bonus time! And she's also having a torrid affair with one of her sexy young agents... [WHISPERING] ...who's black. [RONA SQUEALING] Ha, ha. Oh, my God, that is amazing! And that was a lot better. RONA: Ahh. - At least that time you fired downrange. And, oh, my God, seriously, I am so really super sorry about that. Totally my fault. Buy a suit at Bergdorf's, send the bill to my manager. BRETT: I will take you up on that. Right after I go to the hospital. RONA: Oh, my God, if I, like... ...possessed the capacity to be embarrassed... Eh, I shouldn't have started you off with a fully auto. Let's see what we have in a semiautomatic. [IMITATING GUNFIRE] - Well, that's no good. - Uh... - What's not? - Your stance, you're fighting yourself. - Excuse me? - You're rigid and stiff... ...which, you know, I'm all for, heh-heh, rimshot, but not on the range. You gotta relax. Let your weapon be an extension of your body. Oh, my God. ARCHER: Aw. I meant to make a frowny face. But, hey, speaking of your body and my body and stiffness... Ow! What the hell, Lana! [MUFFLED] I guess that really hurt. What? LANA: You should have ear protection. Yeah, ha-ha-ha. Grown-ups. Keep moving your lips without... [HIGH-PITCH BUZZING] Mawp... Excuse me. Mah... [IN NORMAL VOICE] Can you believe I used to date him? - And... Wait, what? - Yes. And I bet he cheated on you. Just like I bet every one of your boyfriends has, all the way back to... Sorry, but I assume you were just an insanely gawky teenager? - There was some mild gawkiness, but... - Which you've never got over... ...which is why, please don't hate me, you're teeming with insecurities. - When you totally shouldn't be. - Ha, ha, I'm not. You're gorgeous and smart... Have you read Unleashing the Me by Reinhart Schmoll? - Uh... I haven't. - Ooh, you have to read it. Take my copy, it'll change your life and... - Oh, and you have to start keeping a journal. - Uh... Hey, where's my journal? Um, I maybe kind of slightly took it. Wha...? Why would you do that? - Did you think it was meat? PAM: L... Shut up. I wanted to see what she's really like. Give me that. Little Miss Invasion of the Privacy Snatchers. Oh, come on. Haven't you ever snooped on somebody you thought was dreamy? No. Well, except Randy Muckler... ...who turns out was just leading me on to get out of the draft. So I made a phone call to the draft board. Now who's laughing, Mr. Hooks for Hands? - Did...? - A booby trap blew both his arms off. He said it was in a coconut. Mawp... Mawp... Oh, yeah, please. Keep gawking at the deaf person. Mawp... - Ugh, deaf people are gross. - Not as gross as the hook-hand ones. Eh... I don't know. - Mawp, mawp, mawp. - Yeah. Stop. Quit doing that. - What? - Stop. Not helping. - Is that helping? Fricking Lana. - Stop. I mean, even for her, this is over the line. She's gonna wish I was never born. - Just gonna softball it in like that? - Mawp... What? CYRIL: I'm sorry? - I said, "Come in here, I need your help." But I'm on my way to a SexAnon meeting. - Which is exactly why I need you. - You... - Oh, no. Please, Miss Archer, l... - Wha...? Don't flatter yourself. I'm talking about this, the script for Disavowed. Oh. "Cut to Malory Steele, the 50ish and incredibly sexy CIA director..." - Spy comedy? - What? No. - Because that has been done. - It's a taut, sexy thriller. Or it will be, if I could just get all the taut, sexy bits in the right order. Yikes, yeah. You can't have a flashback with a flash-forward in it, that's... - That's where you come in. - Bad writing. Because I wangled a call with the studio execs... ...and I think I can sell them on a rewrite if you fix it. For starters, I don't think you wanna say this guy... ...is "as coal black and thick-muscled as a field hand." I don't need you for content, just for plot structure. Yeah, but racist overtones aside, it really limits your casting options. I mean, only two, three guys could play that. You just have to find the guy who's not intimidated by your power. Or my twin TEC-9s. Or those big, steam-shovelly scoops you call hands. - Wha...? - I'm kidding. Look at me. That's the gawky 6-foot teenager everybody cheats on... ...not the embodiment of sexy, empowered womanhood that you've become. You really think I'm sexy and empowered? Oh, uh... You're like a brown Boudicca. Who I wrote an amazing poem about in... Damn, I wish I could find my journal. So then it's settled. We're a go on Operation... - Ooh. What should we call it? - Dick Sledge. - You wanna...? - No, but it's like sour milk. You just gotta take a whiff. What's the story, neckbones? Sophomore year at my stupid college, I had a crush on the quarterback... ...this super hot guy named Dick Sledge. - Sploosh. - Jinx. I was invisible. He wouldn't even sign my cast when I broke my own arm. But I thought if I knew what he liked, then I'd have an in. So one Saturday when he had a game... ...I broke into his room to see what music he was into... ...or turtles or roll around in his clothes, or whatever... But you were so busy sniffing his jock, you didn't hear him come in. Because he totally snuck up on me. Then I guess I blacked out. I don't remember stabbing him. - What? Why'd you have a knife? - I didn't. It was his stupid pair of scissors. And it was his fault for grabbing me with his throwing hand. That's how his tendon got severed. - Holy shit snacks. - Yeah. They said he could've gone pro. - So glossing over why you broke your arm... - So he'd sign my cast. - What exactly is your point? Duh. Just break into Rona's apartment and put her stupid journal somewhere. - Hey, yeah. - Nope. - Why not? - Because it's just not believable... ...that this guy... Who, also, cannot be named Cassius. - Oh, you don't... - would risk his career... ...for a woman twice his age. - So make her 40. Yeah, and who's gonna play her? Me. That's the whole point. You do realize there's a finite supply of Vaseline in the universe? - Ow! - Type! Nerd. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Mawp. But I'm under a lot of stress. And we're not? Tsk, you got any idea how much I got on my plate? [ARCHER CHUCKLES] - You know... - What? I could've crushed that. Come on, let me help. What you got? Picking up chatter about a bomb threat in the Middle East. Who cares? I'm talking local. [SIGHS] Yes. Yes. See, this is... Wow, single-space, you wanna broad-stroke it for me? Kolchenko, the new Soviet premier, is scheduled to give a speech at the UN... ...in favor of strategic arms limitations, but the hardliners in the KGB... Hey, who am I, Kissinger? Broad strokes. The KGB's gonna shoot this prick as he walks into the UN. - And? - And what? Was that so hard? Count Snackula? No, shut up. We go in, drop the journal and get out. No snooping. Oh, come on, I just wanna see if me and her have stuff in common, like... - Tons of cock porn laying around? - I don't have cock porn just laying around. But sometimes, you know, you forget it's in the VCR. - How do you forget...? - You rub one out, flip back to regular TV... ...Superstars is on, and all of a sudden here's Joe Frazier's dumb ass drowning... ...you forget it's in there. Until Mom and Dad come to visit to tell you she's got Lou Gehrig's disease. Why would you think it's okay to share that? ARCHER: Why are you idiots in the armory? - And give me those. - Hey, we're using those. No, you're not. All this equipment is for field operatives only. Now, beat it. I'm on a mission. - You're not our supervisor. - Shut up. - We're on a mission too. - Da-da-da... We're breaking into Rona's apartment to hide the journal Pam stole. - You're kidding. PAM: No. There's a sniper out there who could spark World War III... ...and you idiots are tying up ISIS resources on high school bullshit. GILLETTE: No. PAM: Yes. I don't see a downside to that, Archer-wise. Here, load up. Should be a big box of grenades here somewhere. Where? Tell me where Pinch Two is supposed to go, and I'll... - Act Two. - Act Two is wall-to-wall... ...with this love story you're making me shoehorn... The forbidden love between Malory and Cassius is central to the plot. Oh, for the love of... Why don't you just make it a shot-for-shot remake of Mandingo. Uh, I hate to interrupt, but I'm off on a dangerous mission. That's what people wanna see. - Not Granny gets jungle fever. - Huh! Get out. But even though it's super-dangerous, I'm preventing World War III, so... LANA: Wait, what? - Uh, nothing, no big deal. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Nope. - Oh, my God, strong and sexy. - Gotta get by. [IN SINGSONG VOICE] Amazing. Will you shut up? If you don't mind, I have to stop KGB snipers... ...from assassinating the Soviet premier as he enters the UN. - Now, there's a Pinch Two. - That's pretty good. You're not taking this. You never qualified as a counter-sniper. I would have. [ALARM CLOCK BEEPING] [ARCHER SNORES] You know, if I'd gone to the thing. - Lf your aunt had balls, she'd be your uncle. - What? - There's your Pinch Two. - So I'll just be taking these. - And me. - Nope. Lana, please, this is perfect for my role. - No way. - You have to. - This is the real thing, Rona. - Which is why it's a job for a man. Which is why shut up because I and Rona, am and are taking the mission. - Oh, my God, this is gonna be... ARCHER: Don't say it. I swear to God. [WHISPERING] Amazing. RONA: Isn't this amazing? LANA: Not really, no. I wish I'd let Archer take this one. But we're, like, keeping the world free for democracy... Not if I can't take out the KGB sniper team who God knows where they are. [OVER RADIO] There's about a bajillion hide sites around here. And a hidden transmitter in your rifle scope. You dumb idiot. - I'm sorry? MAN [OVER PHONE]: You should be. Look, I took this call as a courtesy to Rona, okay? Which now I'm regretting because what kind of farkarkte bullshit is this? - I beg your...? MAN: Disavowed is a spy thriller. - Which is why we want to change the title... MAN: To what, Mandingo II? - Wait, hang on. Hang on. Jeannie! - What? MAN: Anybody doing a Mandingo sequel? When can you get me a treatment? - Two weeks. MAN: You got a week. We're calling it Mandingo Il: The Enslavening. [LINE DISCONNECTS] - Well, Cyril? We did it. - Yeah, we kind of did, didn't we? A taut, sexy thriller. [MALORY GRUNTS] MALORY: Oh, yes. Take me. CYRIL: Mm, mm. MALORY: Oh, take me, Cassius. CYRIL: Mm. RONA [OVER RADIO]: Oh, my God, you seem really tense. You know what I do when I'm tense? No, but I bet you're gonna tell us. RONA: Kelp tape. - What? It's amazing, like, kung-fu monks make this 50-foot tape. - Like a cloth measuring tape, but it's kelp. LANA: Uh... You swallow it over, three days and you start to, you know, pass it... ...then you just slowly, slowly pull it out of you over three more days. - Wait, what? - It pulls all the toxins out of your body... ...and you just feel, ahh, so clean. Oh, yeah? While you're tangled up in a half-mile of shit-covered tape? Heh. Fricking actresses. All right, time for a little tension relief of my own. - You know what else is great? Colonics. - Shut up. I got a window opening up... There's another one. [IN SINGSONG VOICE] This is so exciting. And another one. Shit, and another. That's not all. If you order now, you'll also receive... [GASPS] [IN NORMAL VOICE] No way. Yup. He's down. [IN THROATY VOICE] But not forgotten. Come, Kriegerbots. Avenge your fallen comrade. [IN NORMAL VOICE] What voice is that? Is that from Bullwinkle? Damn it, they're everywhere. There's too many, I can't... Tell me how to help. Shut up and grab that scope and tell me where they are. - Uh, okay. There's a nice way to do that. - Ugh. Will you just...? Okay, there's a... Wait, no, there's... Ahh. Oh, my God, I can see my penthouse. - Well, unless there's a sniper in it. - Well, somebody's in it. Who the **** is in my ******* penthouse? We are. We're complying. - You. Get your fricking hands up. - You're not my supervisor. - We're gonna go to prison. - No, we're not. Say the right stuff and they send you to a mental hospital. I just this second realized why you do macram? instead of knitting. No sharp objects on the ward. They were super strict about that. - Who was...? - She's got a weapon. Drop it. - You're not my supervisor! - God. [GUNSHOTS AND GLASS BREAKING] Damn him. I told him no parties. - Give me. Give me it. - What the shit? - Give me. Give me it. - Rona, stop. This is a serious... Ow! - Situation. I know and, oh, my God, I'm so sorry. - Please, please, don't hate me. - Uh... [SLURRING] What's wrong with me? It's tetrodotoxin from the fugu fish. LANA: What? - Yeah, what? RONA: I'm a Russian sleeper, silly. - Jesus, Lana, how did you not see that? But you're a famous Hollywood actress for, like, many years. How is that possible? Oh, fun. I never get to tell this. Okay, well, my parents were sleepers in L.A., still are. Love them. And we were encouraged to, you know, blend. And so I ended up being an actress. - But it's so unnecessarily elaborate. - Oh. Oh, my God, I know, but the lengths they go to, look at me, you have no idea. [IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] Is my new favorite device of ever. [IN AMERICAN ACCENT] I mean it. With the schnoz and comb-over... ...you're a dead ringer for Karl Malden. [GROANS] [IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] Come on, buddy. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] RONA: Lana, hush. If you sit quietly, the poison should wear off in, like, four hours. LANA: Huh? - But if you struggle, your heart could... - Freeze! Wait, where'd she...? Oh, shit! - And we wouldn't want that. - Damn it. LANA: Archer, look out. ARCHER [SLURRING]: Nice warning, stupid. RONA: There's Kolchenko's motorcade. Oh! This'd be such an amazing finish for Disavowed. So bummed I won't be able to work on it now. Oh, my God, on anything. Oh, my God, I won't be famous anymore. ARCHER: I don't know. Oswald's pretty famous. Not in a good way. Oh, my God, and the money? - Last year, I took home almost 200 grand. ARCHER & LANA: Eh. - In gift bags. ARCHER & LANA: Oh. Yeah, you think? Now some guys in some country I've never been to... ...expect me to throw all that away for some lame, whatever, ideology? - So don't do it. RONA: I know, right? Is that crazy? ARCHER: Absolutely. - But if I do... ...there's some amazing stuff happening in Soviet cinema. And they promised me I could direct. [GUNSHOTS] LANA: Uh, uh... Yeah. Kolchenko's down. Oh, that is so gross. ARCHER: Huh, that's gross? You use shrimp tape. Kelp tape. Oh, and, Lana, promise me you'll try it, especially after this. - Mm. RONA: It really pulls the toxins out. Oh, and please read The Unleashing Of Me. - And please, please, please. LANA: Mm? Don't beat yourself up over this. - You are a sexy, empowered woman. - Mmm. Oh, and speaking of, wish me luck on my directing career... ...which is gonna be... ARCHER: Don't say it. [IN SINGSONG VOICE] - Amazing. [IN NORMAL VOICE] I'm out. [IN NORMAL VOICE] I'm out. [LANA GROANS] - How long did she say this will last? - Four hours. [ARCHER LAUGHING] Oh, my... You're getting off on this. And? [English - US - SDH]
