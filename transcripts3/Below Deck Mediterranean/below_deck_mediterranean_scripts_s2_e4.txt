 - This is when Hannah pulled you aside saying don't waste your time with me. - Yeah. - So either she's lying or you're lying. - I'll be the liar. - Thanks for your support, Lauren. Why don't you go f--- Ben? - I miss you. - I know. [laughs] - The primary charter member, Mr. Skin, They would like to schedule their naked news photo shoot. - I mean, this yacht is only 160 feet. - Okay, you didn't say the lines, but you know what?

 It's what she would have said to me. [creaking] The wind's picking up. If we hit the rocks, we're totally screwed. - Boy, we've really drifted. - I trust the captain. - I need you get in that tender and push. It's getting really close. Max, what are you doing? [horn honking] Push the boat. [horn blares] [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Whoo! - [laughs] - I'm so proud of Skin. - Whoo! - The beauty of the stern tie is it creates this beautiful sanctuary where it feels like it's the guests' private little area. The downside is, if the wind picks up, then we're in danger of hitting the rocks. - Look where we are right now. [laughs] - And we haven't actually lifted an anchor? - No. - That's insane. - F---. I want to stay away from that rock. - Do you want a spot? - Yeah. - Max. I need you to get in the tender. We're getting too close to the rocks. I need you to get in that tender and push. When the wind shifts the boat a little bit, instead of starting the main engines, disrupting the charter clients' trip, you basically put a deckhand in the tender and have 'em push while we reposition the vessel. Max, come push. - Yeah, I got it. - It's getting really close. Okay, so we're gonna tell the clients we're gonna move. I'm gonna re-anchor this boat. - All right. Copy that. - Why isn't Max pushing? Max, come push the boat. What are you waiting for? - Just put the boat up against-- keep it in gear. - You want me to push that massive, huge boat with this little boat? Really? - Give it throttle. There you go. You gotta work on him. - No. - What? Oh, chips. - There you go. So it's jalapeno salsa and guacamole. - We are so close to hitting these rocks, and I'm kind of getting a little bit concerned about getting slapped by silicone over here. - Might wanna tweak the nipples a bit. - Max, you just stand by with the tender. - What do we got? - Oh, good. Okay. I'm too close to the wall here. - All right. - So I'm gonna go out a little farther. - Perfect. Bobby, let's try to pull the anchor in on high speed. - Copy that. [tense music] - All right, Wes, throttle. - There you go. Just keep it there, buddy. Keep going. [engine revving] - Yeah... Thanks for your patience. One thing I'm noting is, nothing always goes to plan. - Of course. - The elements always throw a little surprise at you. - What would happen if, like, someone totally screwed up and you weren't paying attention? - Yeah, of course. [electronic music] I'll drop the starboard first. Shackles in. [chain clanging] [anchor thuds] - Starboard side's locked off. Ready on port. - Drop it. [chain clanging] The wind's picked up, so we are gonna drop two anchors to make us secure. - And it looks like we have some good tension. - We're safe and secure. ♪ ♪ - Whew! - Whoo-hoo! You and Bobby got issues, but I think there's still feelings there. - No. - Are you sure? - Absolutely not. Promise. - Mm-hmm. - [clears throat] - I promise. - Yeah? - Seriously. To know that he's, like, soiling my name, it hurts. - 'Cause she f---ing screwed me over, playing me with Ben. - I thought we were friends, but he wants no part of that. I think he's okay with being a dick to me. - I feel completely alone right now. Hannah is the only friend I have on here, and I f---ed up. - [smacks lips] - Are they after the green juice? - Yeah, can you finish that off for me? - Of course. - Thank you. - Sure thing. [blender whirring] So the passing of my gran is still weighing down on me. I feel like I should be with my family right now, but I'm just trying to keep focused, keep my head down, and just get my job done. - Okay, cool. - Perfect. One green juice coming right up. - How do people drink this sh--? [upbeat music] - We're doing this naked. - So you're gonna have 'em just going naked paddleboarding? - Yeah. - Easy on the boobs! My God! - Sorry you have to see this. [man laughs] - Hannah and Lauren who? - Ken, how's your paddleboarding? - Look what I have to serve dessert with. How cool is this? - Oh, my God. - No. You're not gonna catch me dead in that f---ing thing. - Adam, we're a team. - Nope. - Yeah. - This chef doesn't leave the galley in that sh--. Hell no. Not gonna happen. - I'm sure there'll be lots of people that are disappointed, Adam. - Sandy? - Yes. - Hi. - Hey. - We would all love you to join us for dinner tonight. - Oh, I would love that. I feel honored. - Okay, great. - Thank you. Oh, my God, I'm excited. - The guests told me they wanted to be this way. - Okay. - I'm just kidding. [laughs] - Liar. [laughs] And that's all we got. [both chuckle] Unless you want me to squirt you with the hose. - Like, make yourself comfortable in the whole bed. Okay, let's do this. - And then there's my cabin. Pretty cramped, I know. Sure, the sheets are Egyptian cotton-- I forgot my last line. - Oh, mama mia. - You gonna make some tits? - You know, I didn't think I was gonna like this thing and it was gonna piss me off... - Ah, the guests want a cake shaped as a nude woman. - Wait. Where do you see that? - At the anniversary party. - What? But I'm actually starting to think it's kind of funny. - Hannah, the guests want me to have dinner with them tonight. - Okay. Oh. We're doing a very sexual theme for dessert. - It's gonna be, like, the worst dinner ever for you... - It's gonna be the worst for you to actually see my skills as a chief stew. There's always a bit more pressure when the captain's at dinner with the guests, because we know that they're gonna be watching every move we make. And I really hope that Sandy does us and herself a solid and leaves before the cake of boobs come out. - Um, Sandy, you don't eat duck, right? - No. Chicken's fine. So I'm going back. - It's pretty cool, though. - Thank you. I don't want to do the service with her at the table. - It's gonna be weird. It's like--it's like talking to your grandma about... - Dicks. - Thing-- [both laugh] [mellow music] ♪ ♪ - [humming] - The last couple days with Hannah and I's relationship, not talking to each other, it has sucked. Can I steal you for two seconds? - [sighs] - Two seconds. I just don't want this anymore. I want... to be friends with my Hannah again. First, I jumped to conclusions. - Mm-hmm. - But I wish you'd sold it more like, "Lauren's f---ing lying." But you kind of shrugged it off. You're like, "I didn't say that." - Because you're my friend. All I knew was that she said you guys were on a date and that she showed up and there was two other girls. And I just went, "Oh, that's really slack." I didn't tell Lauren those things. I didn't say anything bad to her. Like, we're friends. Why would I--what-- why would I tell Lauren that? - I'm not perfect. I make mistakes. I overreacted. Hannah's my friend. And I was in a weird spot. I was confused. I didn't know who was lying. She put it in my head that you talk sh--. And then that's what I just thought was going on the other day. - I have no reason to talk badly. If anything, I'd be saying good stuff. - And that's, you know, what I want to apologize about. I'm sorry, you know? - [sighs] - Sorry. Give me a hug. - I'm glad that he's owned up to it and I'm glad he's come to the realization himself that I wasn't lying. But he's burnt me one too many times, so I'm very, very wary of Bobby now. - Have a good dinner. - Thank you. - Time to get changed. [upbeat music] - Oh, hi. - Hey. If there were espresso pods in here... - How many times do I have to tell you? Not in front of other people. - What do you got? - See what you've done? - I tried not to ask, but I couldn't resist any longer. - What was that? "Milia"? - Yeah, I mean, that's-- - Wes. Say my name correctly. - Would you like one? - Yes, please. Thank you. - I'm gonna go drink this right now. - Bye. [driving techno music] - Whew! Gotta run it through the sieve. That's what we do. That's hot as f---. Oops. I've got a stressful night ahead of me. I've got four courses, all the dietary constrictions. Sandy's gonna be sitting at the table, Any time you have the captain at the table, it's like the pressure's on. ♪ ♪ - Perfect. ♪ ♪ - Looks good, honey. - This is really important for me, because although Sandy and I got off on a little bit of a rough start at the beginning... - I don't want stuff all over the salon tomorrow when I wake up. It isn't like you're gonna sort it out tonight. See how it's pushing me over? - I'm getting annoyed, which is really scary, 'cause it's day three. - Yeah. - Our relationship's getting to a good place. So I want to keep it there and keep her happy and keep her in the bridge. Are you excited for dinner? - No. - Yes, I am. 'Cause I get to have his food. - All right, I think I'm ready. - So you have to mind your Ps and Qs at dinner. We got a captain at the table. - How are you two doing? - Good. - So you know, when on anchor watch tonight... - Yes. - Just come out here, take a look at the distance. - Yeah. Awesome. So Malia's gonna get two hours of sleep. [chuckles] - When a vessel's at anchor, someone is always watching the boat. I do three-hour anchor watches. - Let's go get some dinner quick. - Okay. CO2 extinguisher, while you're taking a sh--. - [laughing] - I f---ing dumped it on his ass. - [laughing] - I feel like my history with Bobby has put me in a really terrible situation on this boat. Bobby's able to, like, continue on laughing and carrying on and be positive. [man screaming] - [laughing] - And I'm sinking into, like, a dark hole. I just want to get-- Oh, sorry. I thought you were Bugs. - That's okay. Where the f--- did I put that? You know what? Life's f---ing hard, and you need to grow a thick skin. I can't have a crying stewardess around when I'm trying to do dinner service. - [sniffles] - Okay. - I need some help. I can't run this boat with just Bugs. - Coming up... [mechanical clanging] - What was that? - It won't come in. - Can you see the line? - Yeah. There's, like, a kink in it. - What the F---? - No Way. [laughter] - Awesome. - Got a good-looking charter. - Okay. - Cool. - Where is Lauren? - Okay. I'm gonna start on the cabins now then. - Cool. As a chief steward, I do things a little differently to Hannah. And in the past when somebody's having an emotional breakdown, I prefer to choose the more hands-on approach to help my fellow crewmembers out. Sit down for two secs. - No. - You're all right. - Yeah, I'm fine. - What's going on? - Oh, nothing. I'm okay. - Are you just feeling overwhelmed? - I just want to do my job and not be treated like garbage. He's fabricating things for attention, and I'm getting the sh-- end of the stick. - I am sick up to here of hearing this Bobby thing. I've just lost my grandmother. - [sobs] - You need to pipe down. You're making sh-- awkward. - It's just so unfair that this is happening to me. I just, like, want to get the job done and go to sleep. [sniffles] - What's going on? - I'm gonna be a steward tonight. - Well, that's good. Least I get to spend a little time with you; I feel like I barely even met you. I don't want Lauren to go melting away, but, you know, if it meant I get more Malia time, then so be it, right? [chuckles] Like, f--- it. You want some soup? - Sure. I guess this is the perk of working in here. - Okay, let's go. - Wow. - At that seat. - Gorgeous. - Whoa. Look how beautiful it looks. - Do we have to be on our best behavior if you're sitting-- - Not at all. - Oh, God. - [laughing] - I've done water. I've done wine. I'm gonna do bread, and then we're ready. - Let's go. - When did you come up with the idea to start it? - As a kid, I always would watch as many movies as I could, but only because I was fascinated by the nudity in the movies. I'd record a movie, just extract the nudity, and put 'em on separate tapes. 17 years later, I have the greatest job in the world and the whole thing. - And now here you are in Croatia... - Celebrating. - On a big yacht. ♪ ♪ - Butternut squash bisque. Doesn't that sound lovely? - Don't worry, guys, I'm just on anchor watch. - How late you gotta be up? - Till--I mean, I have to be up till midnight anyway. - Nice and slow. Oh, there you go. Just hand it off. Thank you. [laughs] I could see it in your face. - No. No. - Come on. Come back. - "Oh, there you go. Just hand it off." - I'm a little reluctant to jump into anything. I was in a relationship for seven years with a beautiful Middle Eastern girl. But she never told her parents about me because of cultural differences. - Ooh, what is this stuff, oregano? - It's a lovely herb. It's called thyme. - Oh. - After what I've been through, with the love that I poured into that, I've got trust issues. I don't want to feel that pain again. Oh, my gosh. - So this evening, to start, it's a butternut squash bisque. Bon appétit. [tense music] - This is delicious. - This is absolutely delicious. - It is. - Wow. - [humming] - So we do two tofus. - Two to--is this guy a tofu? - So no shrimp for him. - No. You're not listening to me. I got a salad for him. - It's the first meal service we've done with Captain Sandy at the table, and I want to make sure that she knows the interior of this boat runs absolutely flawlessly, whether she's there or not. - It needs, like, something else. - Why don't you put a slice of something pretty? Lemon. - Nailed it. Knew she was in here for a reason. - So I talked to Hannah. It's like, you know, "Listen." I was like, "Obviously you know why I blew up at you." And obviously Lauren shows, you know, that she can't be trusted. - The soup, you could run it down. - Yeah. I'm totally cool with helping the interior with whatever they need help with. Hannah, you all good? I just want to make sure I'm going-- - Yeah, if you could start washing up. - Yeah. I just kind of wish I could focus just on anchor watch, 'cause it's my first time, but gotta roll with it. [upbeat music] - Slow down on the clearing is what we need to do. Part of that happened in, like, 30 seconds. - If you, as a chef, would prefer me to leave the food in front of them, then-- - People eat slowly, and they like having time in between their courses. - Yeah. - Now we just got cleared in 30 seconds. - Yeah. - Well, don't give me excuses. - I'm not giving you excuses. - All right. I'm telling you that I preferred no plate in front of them than dirty, like, shells. - Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. That's what it sounds like. Good. - So okay, today when we kept, like, drifting closer to the rock, was there, like, an emergency that we didn't know about? - No, not at all. It wasn't an emergency. I was watching it, and we got really close, and the wind was on our beam, on the side, so it was pushing it. - Yeah, I was wondering about that. It's great to know. - So we've got plant lady, Whitney... - Yep. - Sam-- - I don't care about names. I want "chicken, duck, tempeh." [percussive music] ♪ ♪ - So we've got Sam, who doesn't eat meat, who only eats seafood. - Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. - Then we've got plant lady. - Okay, okay. Stop... right there. - Okay. - I've worked with very difficult chefs. I mean, I definitely think it all comes down to communication. Otherwise, it's just gonna go absolutely out of control. - But you just told me to stop talking. - I'm just getting nervous there. Still missing a plate. What is it? - Three tempeh, one chicken, and the rest duck. - Perfect. I've got full-on dinner going. I got a naked lady cake happening. I'm actually starting to sweat for the first time in this galley. Just sauce and go, all right? - Yep. - Thank you. - The main course tonight is pan roasted duck breast, and for the vegan, same thing but with a tempeh and for Sandy, we have the chicken breast. - Thank you so much. - My pleasure. - It looks wonderful. - Mmm. So far, so amazing. - These flavors are fabulous. - Thank God for celebrity nudity. [laughter] - Well, now Sandy will watch it. - Yes. - Yes! - I'm gonna actually just look it up, at least. I mean, I... - Yeah. - Am curious. - Titties to the rescue. You ready to make some nipples? - Yeah, let's make nipples. - Good. - 10, 12, 14, 16! - [sighs] Are you guys still okay to help me out? - Oh, my God, they're, like, painted. Oh, you got a thong on that one. - Thank you, guys. - How did you two meet? - Lot of drugs. No, I'm just kidding. [laughter] - You hit the jackpot, dude. I hope every day, you give gratitude for her. - Oh, are you kidding? I'm on my knees every day. Sorry, Captain Sandy, that you had to hear that. [laughter] - Are you annoyed 'cause you have better muscles than the man? Here, here, here. - I don't know if I can get this thing on. - This is the classiest I have ever looked. [laughter] - Do you want to do this or you want to sit out? - I really would rather, like, get laundry done. - Okay. Are you okay if I start clearing? Do you want a few more minutes? - Uh, if you got it. - Malia. - Yeah. - Do you want to come with me? - Yes. - Oh, it's sticking to that parchment paper. F---. - This is where I'm going to depart. I'm gonna go to the Internet now, and I'm gonna look it up. [laughter] - Thank you so much. - Really. - Are you guys wearing a shirt under this? both: No. - Still wearing my shirt underneath it. Quite tight. [hip-hop music] - So if you guys are happy to just relax for a minute, we've got a dessert coming. Does anyone want a drink, tequila? - Can I get a decaf coffee? - Okay, sure. - No, I don't like it. - Do you have any sort of, like, time estimate on when he's gonna be-- - Oof. - Maybe 10--15-- uh, ten minutes? Are we good? - I don't know. I hope so. F---ing eighth time's a charm. Sh--. Not good. - Coming up... - I am scared sh--less, 'cause the last person I want to see hurt is Wes. [water splashes] - Ah, sh--. - [grunts] Oh, whoa, whoa. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. - Looks cute as sh--. - [laughs] You know, making a perfect nipple out of fondant is not as easy as it looks. Is the nipple erect? Is it soft? Like, did she just get done swimming? I don't know. I've never handled so many titties at once. - Have we moved? - Did we get turned around? - Yeah, we swung a little. - That's okay, right? - Yeah, we're anchored, I think. - Get your birthday suits on. - Hey, guys. [laughter and indistinct chatter] - That's awesome. - Here is your custom... - Oh, my God. - I'm stoked that the charter guests are giving us a standing ovation. - Oh, my God. - All I'm thinking is, the tip is just going up. - Man, you're ripped. - Oh! - Yay! - Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam! Adam! Adam! [applause] - Amazing. - Thank you. - Good work, dude. - The boobs were a complete success, and I didn't have to put on the stupid body shirt. - I can't wait till the pie section comes. [laughter] - Wow. [upbeat music] - That's for you, Sugar. - Oh, thank God. - Bobby, the service is over. You can put a shirt back on. [chuckles] - Do it. - I will lick a little on the front nip, but then... - Aww.

Like, when I'm upset, he's the first person I call. I share everything with him. You know, what you can share with your dad. - And did you call any of the other ones that you love yet? - You're my number one, Dad. - [laughs] - Are the people nice you're working with? - So far, it's hard to, like, walk onto a new boat, new crew. I'm feeling really alone. Um... - Yeah. - Yeah. My parents have been going through an ugly divorce for a couple years now, and I came to Croatia to escape that. I love them both, but I don't want to be caught in the middle. Now, like, I'm replacing my mom and dad with, like, Bobby and Hannah. - You have a lot of experience, like, meeting new people, so it shouldn't be that much of a challenge. - It's been a challenge, but I can get through it. Talking to my dad always helps. I feel that I need to focus on my job and continue to do my job the best I can. - Time for me to say good night. - All right, I love you. - Love you too, sweetheart.

That's the hard part, is-- - You lost your brother? - Mm. - Mm. I was really young when my brother got sick, and he passed away very quickly. When something like that happens, the innocence of your childhood, I guess, is taken away a little bit. - Was he younger or older than you? - Wow. - Yeah. - Since then, I really feel like I've been living every day like it's my last. So every opportunity I have, I take it with both hands. - Yeah, thank you. - And for now, you have me. - Thank you.

The table looks beautiful. - Yeah? women: Morning. - Andrea's here. - Last day. - Yeah. - This is so nice. - All right, I pop this up. - So you're on. - Low speed. - You can go high speed for bringing it in. - Okay. - Okay, you can start pulling up. - Okay. Pulling anchor up. [heavy clattering] - Looks like we spun around last night. [heavy clattering] [metallic clanging] [loud clang] - What was that? - You all right? - It won't come in any more. - Can you see the line? - Mm-hmm. - Is it tight? - Yeah. There's, like, a kink in it. - Hey, um... why did you guys stop pulling the anchor up? What's up? - Captain, it's no longer coming up. There might be a kink in the anchor chain. - Or it's twisted on the other one. - Looks like port's wrapped in itself, so I think we need to go out on the tender to set it off. - How's this a way to start a day? - Hey, Maxie, can you get the key for the tender? - Where is it? - Inside. It's the long white one. - We should start moving soon, I would think. She said it was about 2 1/2 hours to get back. - All righty. We're good to go. - Oh, f--- off, anchors. This sucks. Like, of course this happens to me. First time pulling up the anchor, like, of course. - Oh, sh--. Look at that, bro. - Awesome. I hope I don't get blamed for this one. - Is it wrapped-- - It's all, like, up and it's underneath the bow all in one big group. I've never seen this before. This is really twisted. I'm looking at myself now and just thinking, "I don't have an actual solution to this." - Holy sh--. I've never seen this before. This is really twisted. I don't have an actual solution to this. - Holy sh--. - I wish we had something decent we could use to pull this with. - Oh, my gosh. I just checked the time. It's so late. both: Yeah. - We haven't even left. - Okay, so let's get a line tied on to chain. - The anchor chain that's wrapped, around the port anchor, is that correct? - Yeah, and we're gonna take the tension off of it with the windlass. We're in big trouble right now because there's still guests on board, and we need to get 'em back to port ASAP. I have 60 meters of chain times two hanging in the water. We can't drive the yacht like this. Someone wake Bobby up. - Copy, Sandy. I'll get him up. Bobby! [knock at door] - This is a f---ing dump show. - Ready? She's gonna pull it in a little. Go ahead. Pull it up. All right, that's good. That's good. That's good. - Holy sh--. - The anchor being tangled is exactly like a necklace that's tangled. It's the same thing. You work the chain until it frees itself. - [laughs] - [murmurs indistinctly] - I figured I'd come out here. - Take a look. - Max, can you turn that small line there? - What the hell? - Good morning, Bobby. - What is that rat's nest? - Okay, now wrap that around, and I'll tell you when to pull. Go ahead. - Okay, pulling up. - Sandy, I wouldn't put your head in there. - No. - Oop. - Oh, you have some things in here. - Uh, what? - Your bathing suit. [upbeat music] [laughter] - [whispers] What is going on? - Anchor problems. - Per usual. We are still in the same spot. - That's insane. - Good thing we have all those anchor watches. - It's just annoying 'cause it delays guest departure. [creaking] [indistinct chatter] - Oh! Stop, stop. - The poor guests, you know, they're sort of sticking their heads over, having a look, and you're like, "Oh, I don't want to say "that we're absolutely up Sh-- Creek, but we're up Sh-- Creek basically." F---ing hell. - You can loosen that line. Just don't let it go. - It's no joke what they're working on. They're all manually trying to untangle the chains. - Tighten up on your line, Bobby. - Oh. Stop on the starboard. - Let it go. Let it go. - I can't hold an anchor with my hands. - No, the windlass. [mechanical creaking] - Coronas. - Yay! - Loosen the thinner line. But keep the line in your hand. - Whoa, watch out. - Don't grab that with your hand. - Yeah. Dude. All right. I want Malia back. - Okay, I'll just walk away then. - Yeah. Yeah. - [laughs] - Got your head where there's thousands of pounds of tension. - No, there isn't. You don't know what's going on. Bobby's energy is not helpful. I need assistance, not resistance. Can you get in the tender with them? 'Cause I think maybe your strength could help. - Hey, you guys want to pick me up over here? [groans] - I got some fresh smoothies here. Can I offer anyone-- - I'll have a smoothie. - I think it's really important for stewardesses that we keep the drama to ourselves as crew and not let the guests in on anything. Anyone with a cold beverage is gonna be distracted and happy for a good couple of hours, I would say. - Okay, so you got this one around the top, which is back here, which goes-- - If I pull up on that with the line, will it pull up the anchor? - You want to pull the anchor with this line? - Yeah. - That will not happen. - We just need to pull the chain. - This has a strength of maybe 1,000 pounds. - Tie it on and give me the line, and then you can just stand back if you're afraid. - Afraid. - However, I've been doing this for 27 years. I said you can stand back while I pull up on the chain. Everyone's under a lot of stress. Just take a breath. - You just gotta let her talk through it. - But she wants to call me scared? "Oh, if you're scared, you can leave." All right, the line's going up. Stop there. We got slack. - We're gonna go upstairs. I'm gonna try another beautiful shot. - What are you gonna wear? - I'm totally naked. - Okay. - Yeah, it's so sad. - Okay, stop. Greasy... [indistinct] going port side. - So the chain that is wrapped around the anchor, I want to drop that first, that's in the water. We need to be able to pull the bottom of that chain from underneath the anchor. - Let up a little bit. That top one. - The hard part is seeing what is actually going on under there. - Where's his mask and board shorts? He has get in the water. - If I do not get this undone, we're gonna have to cut the anchor, and that's the last thing you want to do on any boat, because it's your emergency stop; it's your brake in case something does go wrong with the engine. - Hey, everyone, I'm Kat Curtis on a boat in Croatia, and you're watching Naked News. - Keep tensioning. - Huh? - Keep tensioning, see what happens. [chains creaking] Yeah. - All right, I'm gonna come. Come get me, Bobby. - All right. - Hannah, Hannah. Sandy. Could you please call a water taxi? - Copy, Captain. Will do. - Hi there. It's Hannah calling from motor yacht "Sirocco." Would it be possible to get a taxi service out here? Uh, like, as soon as humanly possible? They were supposed to be off at 12:00. - Wes. Is there a place that looks like that we could tie a rope on? - I am scared sh--less, 'cause the last person I want to see hurt is Wes. - These anchors weigh a couple tons. And by pulling or pushing the wrong way, they can unravel, and you could potentially die. - No, no, no. Wes, Wes, Wes. - But I'm so out of ideas, I'm just trying to see from a safe distance what I can do. - Okay. [clanking] Okay, that's good. - Sh--. All I had to do was pop it over, and now we just made it worse. So that sucks. - The wind's picking up. Everyone's tired. Everyone's hungry. But I'm a problem solver. I'm not a panicker. If there's a situation, my mind is working how to solve the problem. We just gotta keep spinning that anchor. - Oh, sh--. - Hi, guys. - Hi. - Hello. - Update? - Yes. So obviously we're having a few issues with the anchor chain. So what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna get a tender to come in and take you guys back to Split so then you can enjoy your afternoon. - What happened with the anchor chain? - I think we've been spinning around a little bit. - It's really tangled, huh? - Yeah. It's always really important, when there is something wrong on a yacht, to let the guests know enough that they're comfortable with the situation, but not to alarm them or stress them out. Because the last thing we want to do on their luxury holiday is scare them. - Thank you. - Pleasure. - All right. So go ahead and pull up on the blue line, and then at the same time, you're loosening on the port anchor. - Copy. - Awesome. [chains jingle] Stop there. Stop there. That worked. Whatever line you have up there, I want you to tie another line to it in the middle somewhere and attach it to the cleat. - Sorry, boss. Can you just go for that again, please? - I think they're having a problem up there. - Oh, I don't even know what people were doing. Someone tells me to move this line and attach that on there, I'm like, "Yeah, okay." I do that, and everyone with a brain was obviously down in the tender. I'm just there for sheer muscle power, you know? - So you're gonna pull up on the blue line. [silverware clatters] - How are they doing? - I've arranged a water taxi to come pick them up. - Perfect. - Well, in the meantime, they can enjoy these lovely stuffed artichokes. - Yay! - We're going into full distraction mode. - They're coming. - I'll put these here for you. - There's a lot at stake here with our tip. We need to make sure they're happy. - Sh--. - The lemon on top? - Yeah, that's what makes it. - Makes it. - Yeah? - This is like a real-- - Oh, that's good. - It's real. - This is, like, plant-based paradise. - Yeah. - [laughs] [engine revving] - Uh, just so you know, the water taxi has arrived to take the guests back to Split. We just need some help with the luggage. - Okay, thank you. All crew, all crew. Let's get into our whites. - I don't know if the charter guests are pissed off because we haven't left yet. And now I see that they're taking a tender back home. Is that gonna affect our tip? I don't know. [engine rumbling] - And people think yachting's easy. - Wes, Wes, Hannah. Just so you know, all the luggage is loaded and in the tender. - Fantastic. Thank you very much. - All crew, all crew. Can you come into the main salon for guest departure? All crew, into the main salon. - Let's do this. - Right now, we need to go to plan B. We've delayed the guests long enough. Let's get 'em off the boat so they can catch their flights. - Yeah. It's just so hard because it's so tight. - Yeah. [woman laughs] - No! - Guys, thank you so much. - Thank you so much. - Sad to leave. - It was a pleasure meeting you. - Awesome time. [all chattering indistinctly] - Lovely to meet you. - [indistinct speech] - From the Mr. Skin team out there, I just want you to know we had a skintastic time. Not only was the service five-star impeccable, but then you show up with those shirts, which absolutely blew our mind. - Hey, guys. [laughter and cheers] - That's awesome. Chef Adam, you made it delicious for everyone... - Thank you very much. - And we appreciate that. - Appreciate that. - And you guys down at the end, how you were able to get the yacht so that we could be so close to the caves was really above and beyond. Last but not least, we call you Badass Captain, 'cause we just--we're just the biggest fans of you. And a small token of my appreciation for the crew. Thank you so much for everything. - We could not get you ashore. - I want you to know no one complained about that, so all good. Bye, guys. all: Bye! - Safe travels. - Mr. Skin's been an absolute bundle of joy, but all us guys are still thinking our tip went down like a sh-- in the bath. [engine revving] - We'll deal with this later. In the meantime, whoever needs to eat, grab a nibble, and let's get back to it. ♪ ♪ - Go for it. I don't even care at this point. Just get us out of here. I feel like we're on our own Gilligan's Island, except we're the island that's floating around, and we can't go anywhere. - We don't have any guests on. - Great idea. - I'm seeing the silver lining here, guys. - Hi, troops. Oh, everyone's leaving me at the lunch table. - I'll sit with you. - Thanks, Bobby. That's very kind. Do you know? - It's a full-on rat's nest of chain on the anchor. - How did that happen? Like, you drug too much chain into too shallow area. - Yeah, right. It just-- we spun around in circles all night. Pulling the anchors probably together, however-- you know, whichever, however it ended up. It's just a mess. [scoffs] - How do we get the pressure off of them? - Oh, okay, I see. So you want me to undo this. [grunts] - You ready? - Go, go, go. - Go. [chains clinking] - Sh--. Hold it. both: Stop! - They may have to cut the anchor chain, and now that's weeks without a job. Sh--. [chains clinking] - Sh--. Stop! - Stop! - Hi, Mom. I really want to come home. No, I know. I know it's the best thing for me to stay. I really want to make it to my gran's funeral. I just really want to be there for my mom. If you want me to come, I will come. But my gran raised me to never be a quitter. And I know that she would have wanted me to have been here. I love you, Mom. I'll chat you later. Okay, bye. ♪ ♪ Do you have any more rubbish in here? - No, I got it all out. There's a pair of panties over there, though, if you want to toss those in the rubbish. - Oh, yeah, I've got the rubbish bin here. - Hey, I just want to say I'm really sorry. I know I'm, like, keeping down the whole crew. I'm trying my best. And I know you're going through a lot, and I'm being kind of selfish with all this. You really can't compare my situation with what Bugs is going through. I need to pull it together and move forward. I'm trying my best to keep it to myself, but I am apparently not doing a good job at it. So I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I'm here for you, and I appreciate you being here. - I'm not even sure what she's apologizing for. Okay. - Is that all the way up? - Yeah, we're-- we're holding there, Max. - No way. - Sh--. - Now we've got our line stuck in between the knots too, making the knot even worse. Yeah, it's really twisted. Yeah. And it goes underneath. - What we're doing isn't working. - Sh--. - Can you use that pry bar? [chain jingles] This is a nightmare. - That chick wanted to do a handstand off of here. Can we jump in, Captain? - I don't care if you jump in the water. - Really? - I wish I could jump in. - I'm getting out of here. - What's it look like, Bobby? - We're getting there. - Girls, you want to go for a swim? - I'm coming. - Hell, yeah. ♪ ♪ - Don't lose that top now, yeah? - Oh, yeah. - It's not bad. Just make sure you pin drop, yeah? - It doesn't take the whole crew to figure out this anchor mess, so while we're stranded, we might as well have some fun. - Three, two, one! [both scream] - [gasps] - Whoo! - Whoo! - Sh--! ♪ ♪ - There you go. Good God, Malia's hot. [laughs] Holy sh--. Oh, you. I forgot about you. Butts are out. Simple as that. - It's getting there. - This last bit I don't think's gonna come, bro. [speaks indistinctly] [chain clinks, water splashes] Just chip away at it. - I like seeing that. - [grunts] Oh, this is so tight. - It's illegal to pull into a port without anchors. If we have to cut the anchors, it's gonna kill our season. I'm not leaving the frickin' anchors. It's not happening. - Oh, man. Come on, this time. [chains clinking] - Huh? - F---. Holy sh--.
