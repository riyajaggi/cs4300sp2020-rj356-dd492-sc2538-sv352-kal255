 - Croatia is the Med's - Croatia is the Med's hidden gem. - Three, two, one! - It's a beautiful coast. It has, like, hundreds of islands. - Everything about this place is just gorgeous. - I mean, how can you not like Croatia? They filmed "Game of Thrones" here. - I put you in the naughty corner. I'm actually back to do this again. Surprise, bitches.

 This year, I'm gonna try a bit of a softer approach, 'cause apparently I can be a little bit scary sometimes. Don't tell me to take a walk from my own pantry, 'cause that's just annoying. But sweet don't pay the paychecks. - Last charter season, I was super green. I still am green. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Whoa. - I asked you to put it on the track--you said track. - Go home, Bobby. - When it comes to looking for a perfect woman... If we weren't here, if it was a different situation, you'd be interested. - Um... - I will find mine.

 - When I'm on charter, it is go time. Don't even look at me wrong. I'm gonna wear whatever the f--- I want to wear, 'cause this is my galley. I always go after what I want. - Are you single? I'm a chef. I can't help myself. - Think of me as one of the deck boys. I grew up with five older brothers who are super adventurous. And I think I can take most things that they throw at me. - And I whooped your ass! - 26, and I'm not looking to be "wifed up." - That's how you cause problems, hesitating like that. Being a bosun, you got to please the captain. You got to please the guests. - Oh, my goodness! It's amazing. - I don't want to fail, and that's my biggest fear, other than snakes, is failing. [chuckles] - What about when they're in a hot tub? - No, no, no. - I'm just one of them guys that someone ask me to do something, I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I'll do that." And then I'll get there, and I'm like, "Oh, how do I do this thing?" - Am I tucking you in? I'm a very positive person. Tomorrow's a new day. - Always a new day. - Seriously, somehow people always drag me into their issues. You've been a bad boy, haven't you, Wes? - I've been very conflicted. - Dr. Bugsy's job is done. - I said a-boom, Team Sirocco. Team Sirocco, chick-a-boom. When I tell people I was an NFL cheerleader, they, like, assume that I'm, like, some floozy. But I'm not. - People have a hard time thinking that a female could actually drive a boat, which I find funny. Always keep your eyes on me. You have to use your common sense. I know you're used to running the boat. That's not gonna happen here. Professionalism is everything. - Stop, stop! Sh--. - That can never happen. - Stop! Stop! Sh--. - I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to work. - I f---ing dare you! Being at sea makes everyone nuts. - Goddamn! There's just so much blood! - F--- you, bro. - No, no, no, no! - Anyone? Anyone? - I should just leave. I feel like such a weak link. - You can't become a leader by being a dick.

How are you going? - Good, welcome aboard. - Good, thank you. - How was your trip? - Good. I came from France. I'm Hannah. - Sandy. both: Nice to meet you. - I've been a yacht captain for 27 years. Boated from Bahamas, New England, Western Med, Eastern Med, Red Sea, Persian Gulf. Chartering has a lot of rules. Being a charter captain, I have a lot of rules. It's really important that the chief stew and I have a good relationship, because I ask a lot of you. And I'm not a micromanager, but I do observe. - Yeah. - And in this industry, I have an image. - Yeah. - And I don't want to ruin the image. - No, that's perfect. My one and only time that I've had a female captain, it really didn't go very well. She was basically just a micro-manager with no self-awareness. And if she's like that, it probably won't end well this time. - Here we have your two stewardesses. - Ah. This one looks familiar-- Lauren. - I'm gonna let you go ahead and sort out the uniforms. This boat needs to be turned around, and we don't have a lot of time. So we're gonna do a walk-through. - Okay, excellent. - Okay, awesome. - [sighs heavily] [driving techno music] ♪ ♪ - Every cabinet I open... [plate clatters] Needs organized. - By the sounds of it, yeah. On many super-yachts, what you see on the outside is absolute perfection. Then when you start diving a little deeper, you realize it really needs organization. - Hello. - Hi. - My name's Adam. - Adam, Sandy. - Pleasure to meet you, Sandy. - Welcome aboard. - Hi, Hannah. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Oh, wow. - Happy to be here. Let's do some cookin'. When I'm on charter, I'm busting my ass. But when I finish, I live in a van. It's the land yacht. Hit highway one. I go for a surf. I chill out. The plan's no plan. What? - Not a porthole. - I got a window? - Adam is like Jake Gyllenhaal and Daniel Craig mixed together. He's very easy on the eyes. [funky music] - Come on up. - Stock it up. I could get used to this. Hey, there. How you doing? - Hi. - Wesley. - Hannah, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - I'm the boson. - Boson, okay, perfect. You'll be sharing with the-- the chef. It's really close to the galley. - Don't worry about that. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'm a pretty good sleeper. - We'll get you some earplugs. - I'll be all right. Don't panic. - So what's going on? - I know your job's really demanding. So when you have time to rest, I want you to rest. - I intend to. - Come to me with any of your issues. - Are you the first mate? - No, I'm the captain. - Okay. [claps hands] I thought you were the chief stew. - Female captains are rare, so this happens often. And I'm not offended. If the food sucks... - Yeah. - The charter sucks. - Game over, yeah. - No pressure. I don't want to keep you. - Perfect, I apologize for misunderstanding your position on the boat. F---. Pleasure to meet you, Captain. - You, too. - See you soon. - Okay. ♪ ♪ - Not that way. Hello? - Hi. - Hi, nice to see you. - Is it automatic, or do I push it? I got to get inside. Oh, there. - How you doing? Roomies, man. - What's up, buddy? Get on in here. - Name's Wesley. - Getting along already. I love it. - I've got some cheat sheets and stuff, but I'm just gonna wait till, uh, the other stewardess comes. And I saw your CDL. I was like, "I know your face is familiar from somewhere." I think I met you in New York, didn't I? - Yes. - When I was there with Bobby. - Hello. - Welcome aboard. - Thank you so much. I'm happy to be aboard. - Well, we have a lot of work to do. - Last charter season, I made some really good tips. I quit the fire department and I got some braces to get some new teeth. - When I have everyone here, I'll have a crew meeting. - Sounds good. Schnitzel. I can't even say anything with S's. How are you? - Nice to see you. - Yeah, I know. This is a nice boat. - It's nice, hey? - Hi. - What's up? - How are you? - [giggles] Nice to see you. - I met Lauren at a nightclub with Bobby. She was one of his three dates. So I've got my fingers crossed that she's better at her job than she is at choosing men. Come up and I'll give you your uniform. - Okay. [upbeat electronic music] - Is this your room? - It's kind of lesser of two evils, though, 'cause they're both tiny. - I think the bottom looks bigger in that room. - All right. - Lauren and I met in New York, and we hooked up and had a short little fling for, you know, a month or two, and, um, I recommended her for the job. That ended, and now we're working together. So I hope things aren't gonna be awkward. Are guys getting V-necks, do you know? Or do I have a chick shirt? - Sorry. I don't know. - Ugh. - I expect a lot, so when I ask you to do something, it's important to me that it gets done. - Yeah. My dad always raised me to work hard and follow the rules. However, one time I did push the boundaries and got caught drinking with my rugby friends and got suspended from school. [music wanes] - When we're on charter, this door is always open. - Okay. - So what happens in here must look... - It's a guest area, sure. - Absolutely. So you have a big job ahead of you. - Hi. - Hi. - Watch out, the bulge is open. I'm Lauren. - I'm Bugs. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Can you say your name again? - Bugs, like Bugs Bunny. You know, bunny. Just Bugs. - Oh, my God, I love that. It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. My real name's actually Christine. But my parents used to call me "little bug." And, uh, it kind of just stuck. - Where are you from? - I'm from South Africa. - Cool. - I just finished up being a chief stew on a private-owned charter yacht for about a year. I decided to take a sabbatical, do some travels. And now, seeing as though it's the end of the season, decided this is the perfect time to make a quick buck before I get back in the chief game. You need help with anything? - It's in French. I can't read this. - I think we can move everything out and then work our way putting it all back in in an even area. - Okay. [lively dance music] - So that's it? - How you doing? - Bobby. - Hey, there. Wes. - Nice to meet you, Max. Yeah, cool, cool. I've got some things that we need you to start up with at forward. How long you been working on boats for? - No, that's all right. - I worked on two boats, that haven't actually left the dock. But, you know, it's yachting. How hard can it be, you know? I can sit and watch the Eskimos. Towel? - So there you go. - Have some fun. - Well, who's this? What's your name? - Malia. - Hi, Malia. - Are you...? - Nice to meet you. My name's Adam. I'm the chef. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. - I meet a lot of deckhands over the last ten years, and, um... needless to say, none of them look like Malia. [laughs] - Hmm. [upbeat music] - Hey, guys. - Hey, how you doing? - Hi. - Hi. - Malia. - I'm Bobby, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - My God, Malia is a total babe. I'm in trouble. So where you from? - Hawaii. - That's rad. - Been teaching scuba diving out there. So I've worked on boats, but I haven't worked on a nice boat. Just sh-- dive boats, so... - Okay, no worries. We all start somewhere. ♪ ♪ - Bugs. - Oh, how's it--Wes. - Good to see you again, man. How you been? - Oh, my gosh, what are the chances? We haven't seen each other in four years. That's insane. [laughs] We know each other. - We went to university together. - What? - Yeah. - We might've made out one night, God. But there was probably a lot of alcohol involved. - Small world. - Hey, we're gonna meet in the main salon. We're gonna have our meeting. - All right, perfect. Dangerous! I told you! ♪ ♪ - All right, everyone, welcome aboard "Sirocco." I want to introduce Mariusz and Bart. Bart is our engineer. Mariusz is the chief officer. I have a reputation in the industry as a very successful, professional charter captain. And you'll find that I'm not an asshole unless you don't follow the rules. No drinking on charter. That's just not gonna happen. I've had meltdowns. I've had fires. I've had pirates chase me. Any scenario you can think of has happened in my 27 years in this industry. I don't want to hear, "On my last boat..." Leave it on your last boat. That's it. [sunny music] All crew, all crew, we have, uh, provisions arriving. - Here comes my goods. - Do you want to maybe tell them we'll get a chain going? - Okay, yeah, of course. Oh, yeah. Red Bulls!

I'm far more productive when captains just back off and let me do my job. - I love this. You've done a miraculous job in less than 24 hours. - It kind of comes in the job title: chief stewardess. - Do you think you can be finished in three hours? - Um... no. [dramatic music] [alarm beeping] - Our anchor's not holding. - Sh--. - Look at that rock over there. - What's up with the crosses? People died up there? - We got to shut this all up. Sh--. - Do you think you're going - Do you think you're going to be done on time? - Um...no. - Can I help you? - [sighs] - Seriously, what can I-- - Really? - Yeah, show me. Come on. It's important for all of us to get rest, because we get grumpy, and then we start yelling at each other. So it's a discipline to get rest. - I would never, like, ask a captain to do cabins. - It's not--it's about being a team, right? - If I gave her a cleaning caddy, I'd feel kind of sexist, because I would never do that to a male captain. - We're gonna have this room finished in one hour. - Okay, guys. In terms of being on deck, if you say "6:00 on deck," I want everyone to be on deck at five to six, shirts tucked in as much as possible. Being a bosun at 25 is tough, 'cause you still want the respect and the trust of people who are older than you, but when you get off the boat, you still want to be 25 and have fun. That's, uh, my adulting done for the day. [laughter] [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - Siblings? You have family? - I got a sister. How about you? - I have five older brothers. - Oh, man! I bet you it's hard for you to get a boyfriend, with them all--beating 'em up probably, right? - Yeah. My mom and dad met on a dive boat. And I started diving when I was ten. It's a lot of fun, 'cause you get to show people what's under the ocean. Like, I had this lady, and she's like, "Are there sharks here?" And I'm like, "Bitch, it's the ocean." [laughs] Like, yeah, there's sharks. Don't worry about saying anything around me. I've heard it all. - [laughing] - Bitch better have my money. - I cleaned this room. - How are you? Did you? - It's done, it's done. - Oh, my God, Captain, thank you. I've never worked with a female captain. She's super hands-on, and it's awesome. - So what's your yachting background? - This is it. - That's awesome. This is my second. - Cool. - Yeah, that's cool. Um, Wiz seems like a cool dude. - Who? - Wiz. - Wiz? Like, Wes? Like Wesley? - No, it's Wiz. - Oh. - This is just a bag. And then there's... - Max, Hannah, Bugs. And the brunette's name? - Lauren. - So you like brunettes. - [laughs] Actually, my last girlfriend was blonde. - Not current girlfriend? - No current. How about yourself? - Boyfriend, none. - Well. - Hannah, Wes, and Adam, can you meet me in the crew mess? - Copy that. On my way. - Hello. - Just getting started. - I know, right? - Right. So, our first charter of the season. They call themselves "The Tribe." - All right. - They're into fitness. They're all around the same age. Primary owns her own fitness clothing line. - They would like to have a tribal-themed dinner, and they look like they're a lot of work on the food side. - A lot of dislikes. - [whistles] Eggs, dairy, meat, and shellfish. - Gluten. - Got to cut out everything in the food world. To claim that you have three, four biological intolerances to food is absolutely bogus. But it's a paying client. Just shut up and do it. - They all want to paddleboard, snorkel, and play with the water toys. - That's right, we got a lot of that on board, so... - Yes, I want a finish time by 9:00. - I've got a message the-- - We're both working on it. - Well, let's see. We'll try, but that's our goal. - Yes. - Any questions? - No, it's time to rock and roll. [claps] - Probably a little different than dive boat guests. - [laughs] Yeah. - Are we going about this at the right pace? - I don't know. - [laughs] [sunny music] ♪ ♪ - Girls, Hannah, if you could just meet me in the main saloon, that would be great. Do you want to sit here with me? - I'll sit here. - Okay. - Okay, so do you guys want to run me through your experience? - I've just got over three years in the yachting industry. I worked my way up to chief stewardess after my second boat. - And you enjoy it? - I do. It's a lot of pressure. - Oh, I know. See these wrinkles? [laughs] It doesn't threaten me at all that my second stewardess has been a chief stewardess before, because on this boat, it's number one, and then number two. And what about you, Lauren? - Um, I did charters in the Caribbean, and I just recently left a boat that was 205 feet, so 62 meters. I grew up in the hospitality industry. My family owns a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale. And I just never really excelled in school, so after cheerleading in the NFL, naturally, hospitality, Ford Lauderdale, boom, yachting. - Okay, perfect. Um, so I think we'll put you in as second steward. Um, then, yeah, we'll get you to be-- help us out as much as you can. - Definitely. - See very, very quickly, I work hard, if not harder than you, but yeah. if you do have any issues at all, just come pull me aside, and I'm always gonna have time to-- to have a chat with you. - Awesome. - Okay, thanks, guys. - Thank you. ♪ ♪ - 9:00 yet? - [laughs] ♪ ♪ - 30 minutes. - 30 minutes? - Throw all this sh-- away. Fold those towels up. Give me that trash can. - Where am I gonna put this ice cream? - Where does this go? - Do you want to just pop them there for now, and I'll just work out whose they are? - I don't want stuff all over the salon tomorrow when I wake up. - With a 9:00 p.m. curfew, this is really not gonna work. - All right, we're gonna take this cover off, and we're gonna stick 'em outside. F---. - I'd say we're pretty much done. Aah! - Once you finish the cabin, if you could detail the hallway... - Oh, wow. Nice, good. Deck crew, nice job on the lazarette. - Thank you, Cap. ♪ ♪ - Why are these f---ing boxes everywhere? Where does this go? - Pardon? That's--yeah, what do you want to do with it? - It isn't like you're gonna sort it out tonight. - I just prefer to put it away, like, properly. - That's not gonna be the case. - When your mom told you to clean your room, you'd shove everything under your bed. It's not getting you anywhere. As soon as you pull that duvet over, it's just all gonna fall out again. - Good first day? - Uh... last year, it was like the alligator coming up, like, "Rawr! Rawr! Rawr!" - Yeah. - And then this year it's like, Dun-dun... dun-dun... - Yeah, when's it gonna strike? It's great to have a familiar face back on board, especially Hannah. Last charter season, we had some ups and downs and some craziness going on. So f--- you, and f--- you, and f--- you! In the end, we apologized. We realized we're family-- brothers and sisters fight. What do you think about the captain? - You know me. Like, I'll be more stressed if I'm in my bunk trying to sleep right now. - Yeah. - You know? Like, I just want to get a few things, like, sorted. Well, listen, I'm just gonna smash this stuff out. - Won't be long. Mwah. All right, sleep good. - Night, honey. Sweet dreams. [tense music] - It's getting there, Hannah. - Mm-hmm. - I want you to go to bed at a decent hour. You will not be working till midnight. - Sleep sounds amazing, as does a self-cleaning boat. - The reason I'm so successful is because my crew get rest. - [sighs softly] - Night, ladies. - Goodnight. ♪ ♪ - Smells good in here. - I don't think disregarding guests' preferences is okay. - Enjoy.

We can do the paddleboarding, Jet Skis-- anything you guys need, it's never too much. - Thank you. - So I'm probably gonna need you to do these two lines here, if that's all right. - Yep.

No rice." Hey, Hannah, real quick. - Yeah? - Um, each guest gets their own Post-It note. What they've ordered goes on the Post-It note. Goes on the rim of the plate. That way, you guys know where it's going, and I know what to put in the plate. - I've never worked with a chef that puts Post-Its on the plates before. I personally don't even want to put fingerprints on the plates, but one thing I've learned in my career is, do not argue with chefs. - I just want to know what the main course was tonight. - I don't know, mate. You know what? You don't discuss your f---ing menus till they come on the f---ing pot anyway. - That makes sense, right? - Yeah. - Okay, cool.
