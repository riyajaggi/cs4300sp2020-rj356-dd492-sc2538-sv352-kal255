 Someone's been in my room. You need to tell security. What on earth were you doing in there? It's these little things that she does. How much do you love me, Rose? - Did you get her? - Nailed her. I've lost my engagement ring. I think Rose took it. Are you sure you don't want any more wine? Give me that! She set me up, Adam. She's clever. You're projecting all your anxiety and stress

 onto this ridiculous argument. How's Aunty Pam? You're a spiteful little girl, aren't you? Where's that photo gone? Bloody thing fell off the wall and the frame broke. Thank you for this evening. It was fun. If a person that you love keeps telling you that you're paranoid, at what point do you start to believe them? You are still not convinced that we got the right one. Are you? Leah? Leah? I said are we ready to start? Leah, are you OK? Leah? Leah!

 Are we ready to start? Absolutely. So, you all have erm, a copy of the essay in question. Actually, I've erm... I've just received some personal news. Sorry. Are you OK? Is there anything we can do to help? Leah, we won't get another opportunity to reconvene before the end of term. This happens now or it doesn't happen at all. Sorry. Up. Not that far. Down. Down. Down, down. Are you trying to annoy me? Hello, love. We're not expecting you, are we? Mum wanted me to get some ice for the party. Oh, OK. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna put this in the freezer. Hello? Francis. I'm fine, I'm fine. Oh. Oh, that's fantastic news. Thank you. Yeah. Yes, of course. I'll be sure to let everyone know. All right, speak soon. Bye. There you go, sweetheart. You have it, Mum. I'm not feeling great. Your dad and I are disgusted with what he's done. Do you want me to speak to him? No. No, I'm fine. Hello, it's me. Again. Leah, please just answer your phone. Also, I've erm, I've kind of got some good news. I've just been at your office. Where are you? Hi, Adam. Have you seen Leah? Erm, no. You wouldn't happen to know where she is? Nice shorts. Thank you. Yes, erm... I took great care to pair these with erm, this faded... possibly lasagne-stained t-shirt, so I'm glad you're around to appreciate the er... Ensemble. Ensemble, yes, exactly. Thank you. I'm sorry about last night. Oh. No, don't. I mean... We were drunk. We were drunk, exactly. So, do you mind deleting the erm... Oh, of course. I've already done it. Oh. Erm... I mean, I will. I promise. And do delete mine, please. Is Leah all right, by the way? Well, she's not answering her phone. How did the review go this morning? That's why I'm asking. It was just about to start and she got up and left. What do you mean? She looked a bit upset and then she kind of rushed off. So the review didn't happen at all? How much lime do you want in this, Mum? I'll do that. Go and have a lie down. Go on. You took your time. Well, the little shop was out of the sherry that Kay likes. Had to go to bloody Sainsbury's. Complete nightmare. Been thinking, Leah, maybe you should take the week off. Give old what's-her-name a wide berth. Got my appraisal tomorrow. Wouldn't look good, would it? No, but she seems like a nasty piece of work. Maybe you should just take it easy. I can handle her, OK? Not from where I'm standing you can't. Thanks, Dad (!) Leah, I... I just can't stand to see her like this. Angela, is Leah here? Leah. Leah, love. I think she's asleep. She wasn't feeling too well. You've got a bloody nerve. What? No, love, it's not on. I know that, but it's between the two of them. Look at him. He doesn't even know, it's pathetic. We know what you've been doing. Sending filthy texts to that young girl. It's disgusting. Leah! Just leave it. It makes me sick. Hey. Do you want to talk about this now or...? It's up to you, Adam. I really don't mind. OK. I erm... I just want you to know... You're... You're pregnant? Yeah. Yeah. Excuse me? Hello, yes. I'm here to visit a student, my daughter. Name, sir? Rose Vaughan. And does she know that you're coming, sir? Not exactly. It's kind of urgent. Can I just...? You just wait here a minute and I'll see what I can do. What do you want? Don't give me that, Rose. We need to talk. You think I don't know what you're doing? Did I say you could come in? Please. May I come in so we can talk? You need to stay away from Leah. She's got nothing to do with any of this. She involved herself, not me. You've made your point. But now, please, can we just, for everyone's sake... You mean for your sake. You promised me that you'd tell them, Michael. I know. But it's our anniversary tomorrow for God's sake. Have a heart. Please don't tell them, Rose. I just need a little more time. They deserve to know. I don't know how many times I can say I'm sorry. I am going to tell them. Soon. But, please, don't punish Leah for my mistake. Please. Thanks for this. It's not exactly like I had a choice, is it? Well, thanks anyway. It'll mean a lot to Pamela. I don't know why we have to go and hold her hand. It's pathetic, Adam. You know I never would have... I... I would never actually... Actually what? She's such a stupid girl. Oh, don't blame her for this. I saw her this morning. She lied... Don't insult my intelligence, Adam. I know exactly how it all played out. You sent that text because she flattered you, didn't she? She looked up to you, she made it really easy for you to feel good about yourself and I don't do that. It was a drunken moment of weakness. I'm not playing it down, I am so sorry. But it doesn't have to mean anything more than that. I'm drawing a line under this now. It's not about that text, Adam. This is about us. Right. I know I've been an idiot, and not just about this, a lot of things. But this... changes everything. No, it doesn't change anything. Does it? This isn't gonna work. No, sorry, Adam. Hang on, wait. What are you saying? Don't follow me, Adam, please. Lisa and Edward are coming this afternoon. And erm... Diane. And the children. Very much looking forward to seeing you. Rose. Rose. Rose! Would you care to join in the conversation? I'll just wait outside. Don't you dare walk away. Don't you dare! She is dying in there. Don't you care at all? What is wrong with you? Well, what do you think is wrong with me? You cannot hold that against us forever. She was as devastated by your mother's death as you. They were sisters, for God's sake! I'll meet you by the car. I'm done with this. Your mother was the coward! And it's not Pam's fault your mother didn't love you enough to stick around! Kettle's broken so you've got to heat the water up on the hob like a flippin' caveman. You sure you're all right? I can stay in tonight if you like. No, I'm fine. Go. Go, go. OK. If you want to watch telly, I'd start looking for the remote now cos that little fucker could be literally anywhere. Bye. Is everything OK? Yesterday, you just walked out. I know. I'm sorry, it's just... You and Charlotte, you've been married, what, ten years? 11. Do you ever feel so unsupported that you think the person that you're married to might actually hate you a little bit? No, I don't. No. Perfect marriage. No. So, er, what happens now? When will I hear about the permanent position? We're going to have to delay talks about your position here, in light of recent events surrounding Rose Vaughan. I'm sorry, Leah. Ah-ah! Hugh, yes. Yes. That's right. Number 48. Seven o'clock. I told you not to call me. You've not told them, have you? You're a coward, Michael. Rose, please. You could have stopped this, you know. Everything all right? Yes. Drives me up the wall, that one. Right, where are those glasses? Leah. I've been looking everywhere for you. Not now. Well, can we talk tonight then at the party? I think it's better if you don't come. - When, then? I don't know. Oh, God, you haven't... I mean, you are still...? Adam, I haven't even had time to think yet. Look, I haven't had a chance to tell you, but erm... We got the grant. The Hurst Foundation. But I want you to know that I turned it down. You shouldn't have done that. I want to be there for you and the baby. I... I got you a present. It was my favourite book when I was a child. You don't have to keep it or anything, I just thought you might like to... My God. Be careful on that thing, won't you? How did you know, Mum, that Dad was the one? Seriously, though. How can you be so sure of how you feel? I think it's because for me it's not a feeling. It's a decision. I wake up every morning and decide to love that father of yours. And I commit to that decision every single day. I mean, it takes a lot of work. And forgiveness is a part of it. You think I should forgive him, then. Happy people don't send photographs of their genitals to 21-year-olds, do they? What do you want to say to me, Mum? I suppose what I'm saying is it's, you know, it's not a question of whether or not to forgive him for this particular incident, it's whether you've got the energy to work together on the fundamental flaws that are clearly there. Cheers. Hello? Rose? Where are you? You came. Rose, where are you? How the hell did you get up here? Can't we... can't we talk inside? No. Come on, sit next to me. Rose... Come on. I'm not getting up there. Go on, I'll hold your hand. No. Go on. Adam, don't be a dick. Just sit next to me. Adam, come on. Oh, for fuck's sake... Argh... It's beautiful, isn't it? Did you have to send it to her? What was I supposed to do? She backed me into a corner. Why, is it bad? She's finished with me if that's what you mean. Don't worry, she'll come to her senses. It's not funny. It is a bit funny. You used me to get out of some stupid review. Do you understand why I might be a little bit angry? Just lighten up, yeah? What are you doing? Do you remember them trust games at school? Rose, stop it. Come on. Don't you feel close to me right now? Go on, ask me something. Ask me anything, then I'll come back in. I promise. Why did you ask me up here tonight? I mean, you've won. It's all over. What am I doing here? I like the way you make me feel. Don't you? Not right now, no. Why? Isn't it exciting? Don't you feel alive? Just think about it, if you pull really hard right now one of two things could happen. You could slip, one or both of us could fall. Or you could pull me in. We'll go back to my room and we'll fuck till morning. That's exciting, isn't it? Shall I nip out and get us a bottle of wine? Not sure. Maybe. Rose? Rose? Adam? Haven't got time for this, Adam. Why aren't you at the party? Is everything OK? Was that her with your phone? Is she here? What do you mean? I got a text from your phone telling me to come here. What was she doing with your phone? Have you seen her? Is she here? The door was locked, Adam, there's no-one here. OK, you go to the party, I'll stay here in case she comes back. Why did she have your phone? Just go to the party. I'll join you there. Just tell me the truth, Adam. All right. So, er... I was in the pub all afternoon. I was feeling pretty... Anyway, I get a call from Rose telling me to go straight over to her place. Why? I don't know. I say no straightaway. And then she gets really angry and starts screaming at me, all this shit about how she's gonna tell you that we slept together. Right. I know. So I'd had enough by then, obviously, so, er, I hung up. And then a few minutes later I go to the loo, come back, and, well, I didn't notice straightaway, but my... my phone had gone. How did she know that you were there? So you just assumed that it was Rose? No, I didn't assume. I knew. How? Because I found this. Was in my jacket pocket. This... this is from my dad's study. He told me it was getting reframed. How did Rose come to have it? I... I don't know. OK. Look, you go to the party, talk to your dad. I'll wait here. I do love you, Leah. I know... I'm an idiot, but I do love you. And I know we're not the perfect couple, we're far from the romantic ideal, but I'm OK with that because we just, we have to be good enough. And I promise I'm gonna work so much harder towards that and even if everything does go tits up, I know there's no other woman in the world I would rather be mother to my child than you. And that has to mean something. That has to mean something. This... This might be our only chance. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Come here, love. I hope you've had enough to drink, 'cause I'm about to get a bit sentimental. '40-something years ago, I walked into a little country pub 'and saw the most beautiful woman I'd ever laid eyes on. Yeah, she was sat next to me. I went into that pub originally for directions, and that's exactly what I got. Because when I came out, several hours and pints later, I had a roadmap of the rest of my life with Angela laid out before me, as clear as day. Rose? Rose, where are you? Now, we've often got lost in the undergrowth or taken the path less well-travelled. But the thing is, we've always done it together. And it's been a hell of a ride. So will you join me in raising your glasses to my partner in crime, my navigator, and my compass, Angela. Angela. Leah! Keep your glasses in the air, ladies and gentlemen, for our brilliant daughter, Leah. To Leah. I need to talk to you, Dad. What? Now. Everything all right? Thank you. Cheers, everybody. Cheers. Where the hell are you? You looking for me? Give me my fucking keys. What the hell are you doing here, Rose? Tell me what you want. Why did Rose have this picture? I don't know. You told me it had fallen down and it was being reframed. Did you give it to Rose? Has... has she been to this house? Of course not. What's going on? Why are you lying, Dad? Look, can we have this conversation tomorrow? Do you actually know this girl? No. Well, yes. She may have been in one of my classes but I don't "know her" know her. You're a terrible liar, Michael. You always have been. There's nothing, Ange. I don't how she got the photo. I just assumed it had fallen off the wall. I swear. Ange, I promise. I don't know how she got it. OK. Fine. Let's just ask her. What? Yeah, you've got her number, haven't you? Erm... I haven't, but Adam has. Come on now. Can't we just enjoy the party? I'll call him. Do you really want to do this now? Just tell us. It was a stupid, stupid mistake a long time ago. Just tell us, Michael. Sarah. My research assistant. When we lived in the old house, you remember her? How long was it going on? It wasn't going on, it was two or three times at the most. Well, which was it? Was it two or was it three? I can barely remember. Three. What does that have to do with this? Rose isn't just your student, Leah. She's your sister. I just wanted Michael to tell Leah the truth. For six years William thought he was my father. Mum told him the night that she died. Didn't really like me after that. He tracked me down one night, drunk and angry. Gave me a black eye and a broken nose. You told me you'd been mugged. He wanted you to look after her. No. He never said that. He just disappeared into the night and I thought that was the end of it. I didn't even know her name. So how did Rose find out? It was during an argument that he told me the truth. So I tracked him down, signed up to all of Michael's classes. Waited for the right time to tell him. She asked for all these extra meetings, extra tuition. And I thought she's just keen, but then... she told me the truth. So, what? You told her you wanted nothing to do with her? It wasn't as clean cut as that. Yeah, but essentially...? I was terrified of losing you, losing you both. So you were angry at Michael and decided to take it out on Leah, is that it? I just wanted to be part of something. Something real. And you said no. You could have said yes, but you said no. She became angry. Volatile. Making threats. She kept turning up at the house and telling me things she was going to do to me and do to herself. So that's when she took the photo? Must have been. It's awful. Awful. I threatened her with police intervention, she seemed to calm down. Then you mentioned her name. I had no idea what she was capable of. And what's the plan now? Tell Angela? Break her heart? Tell Leah about you and me, break her heart, is that it? I suppose there's room for professional solidarity. From one cheat to another, right? I'm so... sorry about Michael... ..but Leah didn't know about you. I promise you that, she's done nothing wrong. All right, then. I'm not gonna tell her a thing. Really? Sure. But if she asks me, I'm not gonna lie. That's not a problem, is it? She's pregnant. Leah... Leah's pregnant. Congratulations. I'm begging you, Rose. Well, like I say, it's only a problem if she asks me, but she's not going to, is she? Because she trusts you. Maybe she doesn't. I don't know, but I'm not gonna lie to someone I care about. What do you mean, care about? What the hell are you talking about? We're not friends. Leah doesn't give a shit about you. You think this changes anything? After what you've put Leah through, you think we're just gonna open our arms and let you in? This makes things worse. You're less than what you were before, do you understand that? You're less than nothing. But you can't just cheat, Adam, and expect to get away with it. Oh, shut up. Shut up! Should have just let you fall off the fucking roof. I genuinely think the world would be a better place. Yeah, but you didn't, though, did you? You're just a leech. Sucking the life out of everything and everyone. We were so happy until you came along. It's like you don't know her at all. It's really quite amusing. Is it? Leah's so tired of you. You can't see it. And why wouldn't she be? You're a coward and she's not. And you both know it. All right, that's enough. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Come on, get out of here. Say what you want to Leah, she won't believe you anyway. Hm, she will. No, she won't. I heard your little story out there. You really think she's gonna believe you and not me? Of course. What, even when I give her all the little details? Like the precise size and shape of it? How it'd fit just snug in my hand, how far it went down my throat? Oh, and how it took you 15 minutes to get hard? What was that little joke you made? "Good things come to those who wait." What, do you tell Leah that joke? Course you do. Just a little joke to hide the shame, the fear that you can't even fuck like you used to, because when that's gone, there really will be nothing. Do you know how easy it was for me to flatter you? To get inside your head? It was just a joke. You should be ashamed of yourself. What's wrong with you? All right, then. Actually, I might tell Leah. Wonder if she'll keep that baby? I know that I wouldn't. St Helen's College, Porter's office. How can I help? Hello? Ben. Something bad's happened and I need your help. So you arrived back at the house at around quarter past midnight, is that correct? And that's when you spoke to Adam about the photo? No, I spoke to Adam about the photo the first time I went back and that would have been about... ..ten. The second time he was lying on the floor, dead. So, er... I checked to see if he was breathing, but there... I called the police and I held him until they arrived. So you arrive back at the party at 10:40 and then you left 40 minutes later. Why? I... had an argument with my dad. Your car was last picked up by CCTV on Lexington Street at 11:20, but you say you didn't arrive home until an hour later. It's only a ten-minute drive. What were you doing for all that time? I needed to clear my head after the argument with my dad, so I went for a drive. For an hour? Sorry, why are we sat here doing nothing? We know who did this. Have you found Rose? Have you arrested her yet?
