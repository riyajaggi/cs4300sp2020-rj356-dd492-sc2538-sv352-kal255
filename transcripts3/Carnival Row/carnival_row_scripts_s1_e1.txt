 Run! Run! Hurry! Come on, run! Stop her, you maggots! Do it now! Oi. I told you already. You get your cut after I get mine. - Fly along now. - No. I'm coming with you this time. Like hell you are. We need you here. - You're our last sparrowhawk. - I'm done, okay?

 Find some other Pix to muster passengers for you. I'm going to the Burgue. You know the deal. Lest you can pay, you best get your twiggy little ass back to shore. With all due respect, Captain, I'm not leaving. Get the fuck off my ship before I throw you off. Try it. I just came from that rock your lads won't even set foot on, and I've cut down tougher things than you in the past five minutes. It's the coastal battery! Fuck it.

 Get her in the hold. Let's get out of here, lads. Move! Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me, miss. I just wanted to say thank you. For what you done. Folks are saying you're the one that arranged for the passage. Please don't thank me. You'll still have to pay them. Or work off your fee in the Burgue. What I did wasn't anything. It was everything. You gave us all a fighting chance at a better life. I-I hope so. Is that a Burguish soldier? Yes. He's somebody I knew from the war. You and he, were you...? Look, it's nothing to be ashamed of. I had a tryst with a Burguish rifleman once. Curiosity, mostly, but he was a nice enough lad. It was a bit more than that for me. Is that why you're headed to the Burgue? To be with him? No. He died. In the last Pact advance. I'm sorry. Oi! What's your hurry, love? Come up and see me. See, you can't sell this Critch bilge out on the Row. Not without a permit. Now, fortunately, it's your lucky day. 'Cause we can sell you one. Um, I need to speak with my father. Oh, he's not here now, is he? Used to be a big shot doctor back in his country, he was. Really? And now he pushes this dross. All right, come on, there. Get this shit out of here, all right? - You can't have this stall here anymore... - You gonna pick that up? What'd you say? - Thatch, no, no, no. Don't. - It's all right, it's all right. Thatch. 'Cause it seemed to me that you was asking for a civics lesson. You don't want to do that. Ooh. Or else what? Oh! You might want to change your trousers. - No, stay down, stay down. Stop it! Sorry, Inspector. He's just joined. Are you off your trolley? Do you know who that is? Thank you, Inspector. - How's your father? - Good. What brings you to the Row this morning? A case. She woke up last night. She's lucid? She's talking? Yeah. By Titania's grace. Magrite, my love, this is Inspector Philostrate. You can call me Philo. You're police? I am. I've been charged with finding the man responsible for these attacks. Unseelie Jack. That's what they've been calling him. What us Critch have been calling him, you mean. Jack would never take the clawhammer to your kind. You can talk to him, Mags. He's one of the good ones. I've talked to some of the others. At least, the ones who can talk. I'm afraid I didn't get very far. I was hoping you could tell me more. Help me bring this man... Well, if we can call him that... To justice. Can I have some tea? Of course. You're from Anoun. I spent some time in the Tirnanese highlands myself during the war. I was stationed in a mimasery. One of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. With some of the bravest people I've ever known. Sometimes I feel like I left my heart behind. Me, too. I hate to ask you to relive this. I know it's painful. But this man is still out there, hunting innocent fae folk. Every three weeks, another one. It's been three weeks since your attack. He's gonna do it again. We have to stop him. I need your help. Please. I heard him before I saw him. He called me a Pix whore. Said he could smell it on me. The darkness. Do you remember what he looked like? His head was shaved, except for the hair on the side of his face. Muttonchops. He had a tattoo on his forearm. Of what? A snake, I think. Anything else? The smallest detail could lead to his arrest. He wore a uniform. A uniform? What kind of uniform? Was it police? Military? Do you know? I haven't been here long. No. 'Course not. Thank you. You've been very helpful, very brave. I can tell you're from the highlands. Hmm. Mr. Philo. I can see you're a good man. I hope you find what you lost there. You as well. Careful, Franny! Not so close, Peter! You heard Nanny. Come back at once. Never mind her, silly old goat. By the Martyr, look! A shipwreck! Run back. Get a constable. Hurry! The Critch are swarming our city. They are changing the very fabric of our society. And not for the better. They bring vices, wantonness, the scourge of lixer addiction, the worship of strange gods. - That's right. - Agreed. Our streets are safe no more. Whole boroughs have become off-limits to decent citizens. The people look to their chancellor for relief. What do they find instead? A majority content to do nothing! It would seem that good Proctor Longerbane has forgotten why the fae folk were forced to flee their lands in the first place. Exactly. Exactly. Because the party he leads chose to let Tirnanoc fall into the hands of the Pact! Let's not forget which party dragged us into that misbegotten adventure in empire making. It was a war we could have won. - Yeah! - Yes! It was a war we should have won! See how he dodges the issue at hand. Burguishmen can't find honest work because the Critch do their jobs for a pittance! If Proctor Longerbane wishes to send the fae folk back to whence they came, let him amass a majority of votes to do so. Hmm? Making laws is the province of this august chamber. Mine is but to see those laws duly enforced. So, that doesn't include the law against consorting with Pix harlots. The audacity! To impugn my family honor! Impugn? How? His slurs matter not. The Breakspear name is above reproach. Even so, that you should have to tolerate such impudence when it's you that holds the majority. Mm, by but a blade's margin. The slightest misstep could cost me the chancellorship. Jonah. Good morning, Father. Hello, Mother. Above reproach. Indeed, husband. And where have you been? Out with friends. - All night. - It would seem. Not on Carnival Row, I trust. Of course not. No, you-you've been quite clear about the boundaries of my comings and goings. You're the chancellor's son, Jonah. You can't give your father's enemies any ammunition. Rest assured, I'd sooner die than become an embarrassment to my dear, beloved father. It's your future that concerns me, Jonah. Don't worry. My future's daffodils and rainbows as far as the eye can see. Fellow Burguishmen! Your city is under siege! But you are not alone! Have your voice heard! So, have you caught him yet? Tourmaline. It's been three weeks since the last one. I expect he'll be on the prowl tonight, won't he? Good to see you, too. I'm just wondering if I should make a point of running my errands before sundown. I'd have had him by now if more of the victims had been forthcoming. Yeah, well, a bloke with a badge knocking on your door isn't exactly a relief where they come from. What? I will grant you, the police are no angels, but we're not the bloody Pact. Yeah, but you lot left us to them, just like you'd leave us to Jack. It's what people are saying. Right. How bad is it? Do I need to be worried about riots? It's tense. A racist with a hammer is beating us where he finds us, and we don't see too many of you lot out here giving a shit. You looking for trouble? Yeah, you're not in Sheep-Land anymore, you fuckin' trotter. This city belongs to us! You'd do well to remember that! Anyway, this Jack business. I can tell you where I'd look. Which is what you're doing here. Last victim said he had muttonchops. Hmm. Well, look at you. Did you see this? Another wreckage. Came from Anoun. Any survivors? Are there ever? She was found on the shore just off Cape Tairn. It's just what this fucking city needs, another Pix mouth to feed. Oi, wake up. Name? Name. Vignette. Vignette Stonemoss. Not yours, you daft thing, the sodding ship that went down. Oh, uh, Deliverance, I think it was. Yeah, and you boarded her where? Near Anoun. Off the coast. They're smart, these Critch runners. Sailing up and down the coast just clear of Pact cannons, eh? Eh, not smart enough to keep clear of the winter squalls, though, are they? What happened to the others? All lost but you, darling. They wouldn't let us out of the hold, even when the ship started taking on water. If they let you out of the hold and you'd winged ashore, you wouldn't be worth nothing to 'em, now would you? Who are you contracted to? I don't know. Only that it was two years' work for the passage. All right. Get her processed. And find out who this ship is registered to, and make sure she gets where she belongs. - Here. - This way. Go. I wonder who he could be. It's the finest house on the Crossing. He must be very rich. Oh, he'd have to be. Sent his solicitor to the auction, bought the place sight unseen is how I heard it. Sight unseen? Well, he must be very rich, indeed. You expecting someone, dear sister? No. Yes? Can I help you? I'm looking for Mr. Ezra Spurnrose. It's all right, Afissa. I'm Ezra Spurnrose. You're the registered owner of the sailing ship Deliverance? What's this all about? - Lost at sea. - Surely, Mr. Spurnrose, you understood the risks involved? Apparently not. I'm-I'm afraid I tied up a considerable portion of my family assets in this enterprise. Uh, I was approached to fund the purchase and furbishment of the... the Deliverance as a passenger vessel in return for a share of the profits earned in bringing these... desperate wretches to our shores. It's not illegal. Is it? No. But it ought to be, if you ask me. We have more than enough Critch here already, thank you very much. Now, as to the disposition of this here Pix. She's indentured for the price of passage. 50 guilders. You can sell that contract to someone else, or you can keep her as a domestic. Your choice. A lady's maid? Oh, Ezra! I've not had one since poor Father died. Well, it is high time we corrected that intolerable state of affairs. Thank you. And I'm sorry. - Now, what for, dear? - For doubting you and your ever mysterious business ventures. Clearly, you are handling our affairs most capably. What's your name, girl? Vignette. Well, come along, then. Let's get you cleaned up. I think we still got the last girl's uniform somewhere. You'll have Swansday off. Please attend to personal matters then and not during the week. Sorry. The last girl we... Uh, milk? The last girl we had had a veritable parade of kin popping in downstairs at all... Oh, that-that's enough. At all hours of the day and night. It was terribly annoying. Not to worry, miss. I have no kin to speak of. Oh, are they all still in Tirnanoc? They're all dead. Well, of course, I think it's dreadful that the Burgue abandoned Tirnanoc to the ravages of the Pact. Taking in an unfortunate such as yourself is the least we can do. You'll need to clean your nails - before you serve me tea again. - Yes, miss. Well, it's no wonder that it fits you so well. All you fae are so slight and hollow-boned. I'm not sure about this braid, though. Don't. Uh, I'm so-so sorry, miss. Please excuse me. I just... I don't have much else left. My braids tell who I am. Oh. How quaint. It reminds me of someone I've lost. I do hope you won't be any trouble. You may go. This is our city! It belongs to the Burguishmen! You need only look at the godless hell these bestial shite races have made of their own fucking lands to know what's at stake here! If Absalom Breakspear can't put a stop to the tide of Critch swamping our shores, then let him step aside for a man who can: Ritter Longerbane! - Longerbane! - Longerbane! Ritter Longerbane! Ritter Longerbane! Well, it's a disgrace, that's what it is. These used to be respectable neighborhoods. Sergeant. What the fuck are you doing here? Well, last I heard, it wasn't illegal to gather with like-minded folk. Not even the sorts of folk who might be happy to take a hammer to a few faerish skulls, eh? You still after that bloke? How long you gonna keep that up? Till I find him. And I will find him. Yeah, well, not among these fine gents. Oh, I don't know. I think he might be close. Very close. What are you insinuating? Just that Jack's last victim said he might be one of you Choppers. A bald one. Wearing a uniform, Sergeant. Well, these fucking Critch. They will say anything to get attention, - won't they, lads? - Right. Yeah. That's right. Then you won't mind showing me your arm, will you? I don't have to show you a fucking thing. Look, I took an oath to protect the people of this good city just like you did. Do you and your like-minded folk consider the fae among those people? Why do you care so bloody much? What's this strange affinity you have for them? Because I served beside their kind in the war. They put their lives on the line, same as we did, and I'm just not sure I like how this city has chosen - to repay them for it. - Ah, right. The war. Yeah, I hear all sorts of things happened over there. Oh, you heard, did you? I wouldn't blame a lad for going a little heathen. No proper women around. Just all those beggared tinks happy to spread for a shiny Burguish stiver. It's easy enough. Just close your eyes, think of your sweetheart back home. See, I heard it's like sticking your cock into a pail of greasy ferrets. Is that true? Stand up, and you'll regret it. Hey! Don't think I won't fucking report you for this. Do it! I can't wait to tell 'em where I found you. Good evening. Evening. Mrs. Fyfe. Mr. Philostrate. I kept your plate warm. Much obliged. Oh, you should be. Supper is served between 6:00 and 7:00. - House rules. - Come, Mr. Bagstock, 20 minutes grace is the least we can afford Mr. Philostrate, considering he spends his days keeping our streets safe. It's favoritism, is what it is. Don't think I haven't noticed. Can't recall you've ever told me how this happened. I'm sure I have. It's a war wound. Yes, but you never told me how. I can't imagine... you'd want to know more than that. Why not? Because not everyone came back, I suppose. You mean my husband? It's been seven years. More. Sometimes the old wounds hurt the most. I've made peace with my pain. It's yours I'm curious about. It was war and it was hard, and... I did things I regret. I'm sure that's not the whole of it. What if it is? What makes you so sure there's a story worth hearing? Because you're a man worth knowing. And men like you are made of stories. Tell me one. Some other time. It's late. Right. Yes. I should go. Good night, Mr. Philostrate. Good night, Mrs. Fyfe. Is this really necessary? Well, we can't have you flying away in the middle of the day, now, can we? Lace up. You can go where you like on your own time, but keep in mind that you're always representing this house. To that end, I don't suppose you know of a train going towards the Tetterby Hotel, do you? What do you know of that place? A friend of mine came to the Burgue a while ago. Heard she might be staying there. The Tetterby is a house of ill repute, girl. On Carnival Row. I must be mistaken, then. You see that you are. Now, listen, girl, I'll be keeping a close watch on you. I've got a full belly and a roof over my head, thanks to this family, and in this city, that's no mean feat. So you mind yourself. Vignette? Are you just about finished in here? Yes, ma'am. I would send you on an errand. Can I count on your discretion? Yes, ma'am. I need you to go to the Row and have this refilled. - Tamphus Oil. - Mm. Along with Calder root and the Martyr knows what else. A drop behind each ear, and men take notice of what they otherwise overlook. I may be plain, but at least I'm clear-eyed about it. It is quite dear, yes. My brother would not approve of such an expenditure. But then again, he's not about to turn 23 with few suitable prospects for marriage, is he? Run along. Rumor has it our new neighbor takes residence today, and it's a safe wager Louisa Pembroke already has a new dress picked out to parade herself in front of him. Lively, now. Found 'em on the bank. Good condition. Worth a guilder apiece, at least. Two guilders for the lot, take or leave. - Excuse me, miss. - Beg your pardon, ma'am. Tourmaline! Vini! How'd you find me? I paid one of the deckhands to track you down for me. Spent the last of my money from sparrowhawking. Only to find out your oldest friend was a whore. - We all do what we have to do - Says the one who spent her days helping refugees escape the Pact. I think you mean selling refugees into indentured servitude. Please. It wasn't heroism. It was a job. Got paid. Same as you. Right. But that's not why you did it. Oh. And why'd I do it? Because people needed help, and that was the help you could give. I've known you long enough to know you never give up. And yet, here I am. Things must be bad, eh? Can't imagine you'd ever leave Tirnanoc. I didn't plan to. I got word that a group was hiding out in the woods, waiting for a boat out. Heard they'd escaped from a camp of some kind. All women and girls. Little girls. The Pact was after them, and I tried to help, but... they killed them all. Every single one of them. The brigade... there were so many of them, I... I knew I'd never make it back, so... I made for the ship. Their ship. The one that I'd arranged for them. That they never lived to see. But you're here now. Mm-hmm. Is this a widow's braid? Mm-hmm. Gods, you don't know, do you? Know what? Vignette... Philo's alive. And you think Sergeant Dombey is this, uh... - What do you call him? - Unseelie Jack. Unseelie? It means "hateful" in their tongue. I can't rule Dombey out, sir. And this has nothing to do with your own personal distaste - for the sergeant's politics? - Only insofar as his politics align with Unseelie Jack's politics. And that he fits the description offered by the latest victim... down to the fact that he wears a uniform. Even so, you can't just go around assaulting your colleagues. The men in this building are not your enemies. I am not in the business of deciding who my enemies are. Neither are they. Justice is justice. - When was your last day off? - I don't need a day off. - What's the hurry on this? - What's the fuckin' hurry? Sir, every three weeks this lunatic brings down his hammer. - Any day now... - Any day now there's gonna be a dead lixer fiend. Or an aborted half-blood or a Black Raven who caught the sharp end of a knife fight. The Row is an ugly place. These are not criminals or cutthroats. The last victim was a maid. The one before that was a fisherman. Well, you can't save them all, Philo. Damn it, I can save one! Just let me put a man on Dombey. Absolutely not. You want me to put surveillance on one of our own, you better come to me with more than some fucking hunch. It's more than a hunch. Philo, go home! Get some rest. Come back fresh tomorrow. - Sir, I can... - Philo! That wasn't a request. Hey, what'd he say? Wanted me to leave Dombey be. Said I was making it personal. What have you got? Sketch artist got back from talking to the victim. Right. Best keep this to ourselves, I think. Oi. Cuppins. Are we running a naval academy now? Fucking Basilisk is in port. Basilisk? Ironclad. Long-range. They keep them out there in that tin can for weeks until they're half mad, then back home to let off some steam. - Sounds like a bloody nightmare. - It sure is. Mine. Every three weeks. Move. Every three weeks? Jack doesn't wear a policeman's uniform. He's a fuckin' sailor. I should've seen it sooner. You were right. They're all the same, these Burguishmen. They come with promises, take what we have, and when there's nothing left to take, they leave. It's a common enough story. The story of our whole fuckin' country. So we move on. We tell a new story, a better one. No. No. Not yet. Vignette, listen. Just calm down, take a minute and listen to me. I'm not done with him. He will know what he's done to me. He will look in my eyes and know. Fuck. A carriage. A fine one. It's him. - It must be. - Is everything all right? Our new neighbor. - Shall we be the first to welcome him? - Imogen! What? It's the friendly thing to do. - It's not proper. - Ah, don't be so old-fashioned. This is the seventh century. Imogen. Oh, you're coming after all? Well, somebody had to stop you making a spectacle of yourself. May I help you? Good afternoon, sir. Is the master of the house at home? Whom may I say is calling? - It's Ezra... - Ezra Spurnrose and his sister. We're neighbors, come to extend our hospitality. Show them in, Fergus. Thank you. Spurnrose. I hear your father was the finest watchmaker in the Burgue. We'd like to think so, yes. Is the master of the house available? I'm master here. I shouldn't have said anything. She survived seven years in Pact-occupied Tirnanoc. I'm sure she can survive a night in the Burgue. Yeah, I'm sure she can too. I'm not sure about the bloke she's mad at. Well, that's not the kid again, is it? Second time this week. The chancellor's own kin, just waltzing in the front door of a faerie brothel like he's never heard of trouble. There goes my night. Mmm. Fine, I'll throw my hat in. - Really? You sure? - Yes, yes. Why not? I could use a distraction. Jonah. Welcome back, sir. Hello, Moira, dear. What kind of company are you in the mood for this evening? Fleury. I got to piss. Any luck on the waterfront? I showed the sketch to the boatswain. If he knew the face, he wasn't saying. I was afraid of that. So what we doing here, then? Like they say, if the fish you're looking to catch isn't in the sea... look in the tank. These lads aren't gonna give up one of their own so easy. Not gonna ask 'em to. All the victims were struck on the right side of the head. Which means our man was left-handed. His last victim said he had a tattoo on his forearm. You want to ask 'em to roll up their sleeves? After a fashion. Fucking told you, that cunt. He's a fucking prick. Oi! Where you goin' with that? See you back there. 'Scuse me. Ow! Sorry, mate. - Oh, what a... - For fuck's sake! Oh, fucking hell. Fuck. Inspector! It's him! It's Jack! Go around! Show me your hands! It's done! Done? It's just beginning. I had to stop 'em. I had to. You don't know the evil they've been about right under your nose. Step away from the ledge. They're not our god's children. They come from a dark place. And they haven't come alone. They've brought something with them. Something that will be the end of us. I've seen it. With my own eyes. You think I'm mad. I know darkness. I've been to the twilight edge of the world and dredged up things from the sunless deep that would turn your blood cold. But nothing like the thing I saw in the dark beneath our very feet. You're ill-prepared for the hardship that lies ahead. There is more here than you can fathom. And while you go about your little life, so sure that this world still belongs to you... some dark god wakes. Needless to say, we couldn't get out of there fast enough. Imagine it. A Puck living here. On Finistere Crossing. What is the city coming to? My robe. Mm, that'll be all, Vignette. I'll take tea in my room here at 7:00. Good night, miss. Mmm. Mr. Philostrate. What are you doing in here? Oh, is this no longer my room? I thought I'd surprise you. For your birthday. Well, it's not my birthday. You moved in a year ago, so I figured I must have missed at least one by now. What happened to your hand? And your head. Philo. Someone threw a hammer at me. You know how it goes. What? Let me see? You should get that looked at. - There's no need. - You might need stitches. - No, it's fine. No doctors. - You could have a concussion. I said... no doctors. I'm sorry. It's been a night. I just have a lot on my mind. You can talk about it. You know that, right? It's not unheard of, for people who share a bed to share some thoughts on occasion. Another time, maybe. - Don't do that. - What? "Another time, maybe." Look, I don't want to burden you with these things, Portia. It's no burden. You don't know the weight of it. I don't. But I know you carry it alone, and you don't have to. I want to know you, Philo. And I'm telling you you may just be happier in the dark. I see. Yes. Right. I keep forgetting what this is. - I didn't mean to... - No, you're just looking out for me. Thank you for that. Just carry on and let me know the next time you fancy a quick fuck. Portia... Good night, Mr. Philostrate. You lying shit. You're alive. Mima Roosan came to me with blood on her hands. She said you died in her arms. Why did she lie to me? Because I told her to. We... we told each other everything. Couldn't you have at least told me good-bye? I wanted to. I never meant to hurt you. Hurt me? You destroyed me. I waited for you, and you left me in the ashes of my homeland with nothing but grief for seven years. I should've done this the day we met. Do it. Do it. You're not worth it. I wish you had died. There's more here than you can fathom. And while you go about your little life, so sure that this world still belongs to you, some dark god wakes.
