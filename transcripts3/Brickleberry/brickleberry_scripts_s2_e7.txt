I MADE YOU. - MALLOY, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP OUR RELATIONSHIP ON THE DOWN-LOW, THAT'S ALL. EVERYBODY ALREADY THINKS IT'S WEIRD. - WEIRD? LINCOLN SUCKED OFF A KANGAROO.

YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO RUIN MY LIFE EVER SINCE I GOT HERE. - GIRL, YOU SO CRAZY. IT WAS ALL IN FUN. - THE ANSWER IS "HELL, NO." - THE STREETS WILL RUN RED WITH YOUR BLOOD. - SO, WHEN THEY SAID PLUTO WAS NO LONGER A PLANET, WELL, THAT REALLY TICKED ME OFF! AM I CRAZY? - [whimpers] NOT FROM WHERE I'M SITTING. - YOU KNOW WHO ELSE LIKES PLUTO? MY SISTER. [imitates female voice] GUESS WHAT, BIG BROTHER. [normal voice] WHAT, LITTLE SISTER? [imitates female voice] PLUTO'S NOT EVEN A PLANET ANYMORE. [normal voice] SHUT YOUR LYING MOUTH, YOU BITCH! SORRY. SIBLING RIVALRY. - [laughs awkwardly] OH! SHE--SHE SEEMS NICE.

YOU GUYS LOOK MORE LIKE THE ELLIS ISLAND BOOK CLUB. - MALLOY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - QUIET, MILITIA ETHERIDGE. LET THE TALKING BEAR FINISH TALKING. - IF YOU WANT TO BE A REAL MILITIA, YOU NEED TO STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING BIG, SOMETHING DESTRUCTIVE, SOMETHING THAT PUTS YOU IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. - LIKE THAT GUY WHO INVENTED THE DOUBLE-DONGED DILDO! - CAN HE NOT TALK? IT'S TIME TO MAKE A STATEMENT THE WORLD WILL HEAR! [cheering] - HELL, YEAH! COUNT US IN! - YES! IT'S TIME WE STARTED ACTING LIKE A REAL [bleep] MILITIA! - OUR CHILDREN'S TEST SCORES HAVE BEEN DROPPING AT AN ALARMING RATE. WHAT IS YOUR PLAN, MR. JOHNSON? - LISTEN, CHUCKLES. I'LL BE ASKING THE QUESTIONS AROUND HERE. - UH, NO, YOU WON'T. HE'S THE MODERATOR. - NOT ANYMORE. I'M THE MODERATOR NOW. ♪ I'M THE MODERATOR, LOOK AT ME ♪ ♪ EVERYBODY LOVES ME, I'M THE MODERATOR ♪ ♪ I'M THE MODERATOR, I'M THE MODERATOR ♪ ♪ I'M THE MODERATOR! - LET'S JUST TAKE SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE. - I'LL ALLOW IT. - HELLO, EVERYBODY. I'M THE LEADER OF THE ELLIS ISLAND BOOK CLUB MILITIA, AND WE HAVE DECIDED TO ASSASSINATE THE NEW GOVERNOR. SO, WHICHEVER ONE OF Y'ALL WINS, YOU'RE DEAD! Y'ALL HAVE A NICE DAY. - LISTEN HERE. I DON'T RESPOND TO THREATS. ALL MY LIFE, I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN, I SHOULD GIVE UP. WELL GUESS WHAT! I'M... [all gasp] DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR IMMEDIATELY. - NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE. - NO, YOU'RE NOT! I DROPPED OUT FIRST. - I'M MUCH MORE QUALIFIED TO DROP OUT OF THIS RACE THAN YOU! - YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT I CAN'T DROP OUT OF THIS RACE. - WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE CALL ME AN AMBULANCE? - JESUS! THIS GUY ASKS A LOT OF [bleep] QUESTIONS! - UH, MALLOY? - YES, CONNIE? - I'M REALLY HAPPY YOU JOINED OUR MILITIA AND EVERYTHING, BUT, UH, I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT YOUR IDEA TO VIOLENTLY ASSASSINATE THE GOVERNOR. - RELAX, CONNIE. NO ONE'S GONNA GET HURT. - REALLY? - REALLY. I JUST WANT TO SCARE THEM INTO DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE. IF I CAN'T LIVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION, NEITHER CAN THEY. TRUST ME. NO ONE'S GONNA DIE TODAY. - SOMEONE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO DIE TODAY, AS WOODY JOHNSON AND ETHEL ANDERSON'S NAMES WILL REMAIN ON THE BALLOT WHETHER THEY DROP OUT OR NOT, WHICH MEANS ONE OF THEM WILL BE ELECTED GOVERNOR AND SWIFTLY ASSASSINATED. - AIN'T I A STINKER? - HI, I'M ETHEL ANDERSON, AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT I SHOULD BE ELECTED GOVERNOR. WHY, YOU SAY? BECAUSE I'M A RAGING, UNREPENTANT ALCOHOLIC, AND I BELIEVE THE HOLOCAUST NEVER HAPPENED, BUT I WISH IT DID. VOTE WOODY JOHNSON FOR GOVERNOR. - HI, I'M WOODY JOHNSON, AND THERE'S NO USE BEATING AROUND THE BUSH. I MOLEST KIDS, AND I LOVE IT. - AND I PROMISE TO MAKE THIS STATE A SAFE HAVEN FOR TERRORISTS. - HEY, CAN I JUST SAY, "[bleep] OUR TROOPS"? - LOOK WHERE I CAN STICK THE STATUE OF LIBERTY! - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISN'T A PROBLEM. IT'S A SOLUTION. - ♪ THE CAMPTOWN LADIES SING THIS SONG ♪ ♪ DO-DAH, DO-DAH [horns honking] - AND THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE IN. - IF I WIN, I AM DROPPING OFF THE GRID. I'LL CHANGE MY NAME TO SOMETHING INCONSPICUOUS, LIKE... RICK SWORDFIRE. - YEAH, GOOD THINKING. - THE WINNER AND THE NEW STATE GOVERNOR IS... WOODY JOHNSON... - WHAT? - WHOO-HOO! IN YOUR FACE, DEAD MAN! - BY THE REMARKABLY LOW COUNT OF TWO VOTES TO NONE. - WAIT. YOU VOTED FOR YOURSELF? - WELL, I WASN'T GONNA VOTE FOR A GODDAMN WOMAN. - HELLO, MR. GOVERNOR. - [Australian accent] YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY. MY NAME IS RICK SWORDFIRE. - I KNEW RICK SWORDFIRE, AND YOU, SIR, ARE NO RICK SWORDFIRE! - [normal voice] OHH... ET TU, MALLOY? - HEY, YOU WOULDN'T LET ME LIVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. - OKAY! YOU CAN LIVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION! [crying] YOU CAN HAVE THE MASTER BEDROOM! I'LL SLEEP IN THE SHITTER! I DON'T CARE! JUST TALK THEM DOWN! - REALLY? OKAY, GUYS, GREAT NEWS. PUT DOWN YOUR GUNS. THE ASSASSINATION IS A NO-GO. - OH, HELL, NO! YOU CAN'T GET A MILITIA ALL HOT AND BOTHERED AND LEAVE 'EM HANGING LIKE THAT. IT'S TIME TO BUST A NUT IN HIS ASS! UH, I MEAN CAP. - WE CAN DO BOTH! - STOP! - ETHEL? WHAT ARE-- - SHUT UP, WOODY. LET A WOMAN TALK SOME SENSE INTO THESE IDIOTS. - OUT OF THE WAY, TWO TITS! WE HAVE A MESSAGE TO SEND! - WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE COULD YOU POSSIBLY WANT TO SEND BY KILLING THIS PATHETIC PIECE OF SHIT? - WE'RE GONNA KILL HIM BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS A GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED BY THE ZIONIST JEW THREAT! - UH, BOBBY, WE'RE OKAY WITH JEW PEOPLE NOW. CHAIM GOT US THESE UNIFORMS FROM HIS GARMENT FACTORY. - FINE, WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS, WE GONNA KILL HIM 'CAUSE HE WANTS TO FLOOD OUR SHORES WITH DIRTY IMMIGRANTS. - PSST, IMMIGRANTS ARE GOOD, REMEMBER? PROFESSOR CHIN DID ALL OUR LAUNDRY, AND DR. PATEL DROVE US HERE IN HIS CAB. - AW, SHIT, ARE WE ANTI-ANYTHING ANYMORE? - I KNOW WHAT WE ARE! WE'RE ANTI-WHITE GARBAGE TRASH MAN! - OH! [gunfire] - GUYS! STOP! I GOT AN IDEA. HOW ABOUT IF WE MAKE OUR MILITIA ALL ABOUT BEING ANTI-VIOLENCE? [gunfire] - SCREW IT. [gunfire] - YOU THINK WE CAN JUST LEAVE? - I DON'T SEE WHY NOT. ETHEL, YOU SAVED MY LIFE. YOU'VE PROVED TO ME THAT WOMEN ARE CAPABLE OF GREAT THINGS. I WAS WRONG. I'M SORRY. - YOUR FIRST FEMALE APOLOGY. WOW. - I DID ACT LIKE A MISOGYNIST ASSHOLE, YET YOU STILL SAVED ME. WHY? - BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE MAY BE DIFFERENT GENDERS, DEEP DOWN INSIDE, WE'RE BOTH RED-BLOODED-- - WHITE PEOPLE. HIGH FIVE! - NO, ACTUALLY, I WAS GOING TO SAY-- - SHH-SHH. WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT MY FIRST ACT AS YOUR GOVERNOR IS TO REMOVE THE HIGHWAY RUNNING THROUGH BRICKLEBERRY PARK. THE WRECKING CREW IS ALREADY ON ITS WAY. - AH, WELL, PHIL, YOUR FAMILY IS GREAT COMPANY, BUT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR SIX STRAIGHT DAYS. - OH, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. UH-OH. YOU FORGOT TO SAY, "UNO"! [helicopter flying overhead] - OH, A HELICOPTER! THANK GOD! I'M SAVED! AAH! - UNO! - AND WITH THAT DONE, I'M STEPPING DOWN AS GOVERNOR. AS A THANK-YOU TO MY FRIEND ETHEL, MY LAST ACT IS TO PARDON GOVERNOR MELCHER FOR HER HAVING SEX ON TAPE WITH A BLACK GUY AND HAND THE JOB BACK TO HER. - THANK YOU, WOODY! - IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. - SHE GOVERNOR AGAIN? YOU MADE ME ROB THE CRADLE FOR NOTHING? - WAIT A MINUTE. YOU WERE BEHIND THAT SEX TAPE? - [chuckles nervously] WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE, RIGHT? [yawns] [door slams] "THE WOODY JOHNSON PRISON FOR CRIMINALLY INSANE MAN-RAPISTS"? UH-OH. [groans] - AAH!
