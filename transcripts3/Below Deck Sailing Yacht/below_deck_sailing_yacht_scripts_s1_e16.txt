 - Previously, on "Below Deck - Previously, on "Below Deck Sailing Yacht"... - You and Chris... what's going on? - Knowing that the season's coming to an end, this is kind of becoming torture for me. - [ grunting ] Come on! As I'm lifting the Seabob, I can feel my back just go [ clocks tongue ]. Ugh! But I've got quite a high pain threshold. Yo-yo-yo! - I need to request a doctor to come and see a deckhand of mine.

 - Oh sh--. My hamstring, I just feel it go, like, ping. - Ciara's gonna be the only one left of us. - Okay, I'm gonna lie down. - Wanna lay with me for 30 minutes? - Yeah. - Are your minions laying down as well? - No. - Everything okay with service and everything? - Not really. Jenna basically has put Madison on service and laundry... - Okay. - ...so she can go take a nap with Adam. - I haven't felt like this for a long time.

 I've given the majority of my life to yachting. At some point, you have to be a little bit selfish. - Is it a problem for you, or... - I didn't wanna say... like, I'm not saying anything. I'm just trying to do my job. - Gimme a hug! Can't get enough of these lately. - I've worked with a lot of couples. It's unprofessional, and it needs to stop. Interior, I think the service has dropped a little bit. - Do you have a minute? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's a problem, and it ends now. A couple of things have been brought to my attention. Two of the interior were down at the same time, you and Georgia. During the day, if the guests are on board, it should be one person is down and that two people are available. - So that didn't happen at all. - It kinda looked like it did happen. I spoke with Madison and I could see that both you and Georgia were down at that time. But she was still tasked with, I think, doing the cabins and the laundry, which is not how it's done. - Yeah, without knowing the specific day, I don't know. But I know that Georgia and I... - It was day two. - I can't recall that day, even though I know it's only two days. But you have to understand it's a little bit frustrating to hear, like, what sounds like negative feedback, and I'm a little bit defensive about it. Because it's like I put so much of my thought and effort into planning out that time... - Okay. - ...to make sure that the guests are happy. And it wouldn't be, like... - Okay. - ...oh, I just wanna [bleep] off right now. - Well... but it was also that you and Adam were on a break at the same time so that you can Adam could go and chill out together. That's drawing attention. And I've seen things. I can only imagine what I haven't seen. Do you... That's not cool. Do you understand my point? - I do, but it's, like, where do you ever be affectionate? - That is not my problem. In those situations, we're meant to be discreet. - So should I just tell Adam to not touch me anymore? - If you want me to speak with both of you as a couple, I'm happy to do that. Do me a favor... tone it down a bit. For the last charter, I want us all to finish on a high note. We can all take it up a notch. Thank you very much. - Mm. - What were they having that big meeting about? - I honestly have no idea. - Hm? - I literally have no idea. I've just been trying to flip this boat. - I just need to know what the full picture is. I'm asking if you know what it is. - I don't know what the full picture is. You literally know as much as I know. - Hi. - Do you know which way I'm going? I'm the doctor. - Oh, doctor, yeah, yeah. - Hi. - This is Chris. - I'm not a big one for going to see the doctor. I've just gotta work it out, and I'm gonna be perfectly fine. - Tell me the story... everything was all right until when? - The day before yesterday? I was lifting the Seabob. The pain kind of developed and went... ...through to my foot. And my heel and all the outside of the foot is numb and, like, tingling. - What I want you to do is just basically close your eyes. - Mm-hmm. - I'm going to touch you with this. - Yeah, I can barely feel that. Yeah, I can barely feel it. - Right... I think we have a big problem. We need an MRI scan as soon as possible. - Really? - Oh, yes. - Yeah. Am I okay to keep working? - You're not fit to work. - I don't know what it is. I've never had pain like this. It is scary. I don't know what's gonna happen. - I don't even feel like ----ing doing anything. I hate this. - Why don't you go and take a break? - I don't wanna get in trouble. I'm just really annoyed. - What are you talking about right now? - Apparently some crew thought we both weren't working when we took a half an hour break together. So we're not allowed to touch each other. - Well, just brush it off. It's all you can do. - I do have a hard time brushing stuff like that off. Because it's, like, I work my ----ing ass off, and then you get a comment about not having service up to par. Like [bleep] you. - Service has been flawless, and I know the food's been ----ing flawless, so. - Mm-hmm. - I'm sorry that it came down on you. - It just annoys me, because it's, like, wait, people can't be happy and be working in the same environment. - I just won't touch you the rest of the trip. Let me get one last hug before I sign off. Since we're not allowed to touch each other. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry, hurry... - Hello. - Captain! - Everything good? - We have a problem. - Okay. - The nerve that comes out, either out of the fifth lumbar or the first sacral vertebra is getting squashed. - Okay. - And that's a bad sign. That needs an MRI scan as soon as possible, therefore, until we see the report, he cannot work. I want complete rest of him. - Chris is one of my best deckhands, so I'm concerned for him. But also, we have one more charter, and it starts tomorrow. What are my options? - Let's get this ball rolling on the MRI. If there's a potential I can work, I wanna work. I want to work. - Of course, I know that. I know that. - Well, guys, we will speak again. - Yeah, thank you very much. - I'm laughing my way through the last charter. - Because it's all ----ing hysterical. - So what's the verdict now? - He can go and have a test done, but there's a chance that he won't be able to work. - But, like, I've been lifting lines, I've been working... - Yeah, that probably wasn't a good idea. - That's probably not helping it. - I think it's not advisable that you try to just struggle through. - Well, let's get this MRI. - And then we'll move forward and figure out what we're gonna do. - Sorry, guys. - That's all right. I'm annoyed because we literally just got rid of somebody who couldn't do their job to now be given somebody who has injured themselves and cannot do the job. I can't catch a break. - [ sighs ] When it rains, it pours. - It's just you and me. - What do you mean, "Just you and me?" - He's out, he's gonna go to bed and rest because his back's ----ed. - For how long? - Potentially the whole charter. - Well, that's not gonna work. [ laughs ] - So, Madison. - Yeah? - I'm feeling super frustrated right now. - Why? - Because I don't like people ----ing with my personal life. - Yeah? - And I feel like you have. - How? - By talking to everyone about how annoyed you are by me and Adam being affectionate and whatnot, and that's what Glenn spoke to me about today. - I honestly never said anything. Glenn came to me and said, "Do you have an issue?" and I said, "No, what they do is what they do." Everyone sees you in the crew mess. I'm not saying sh--. I'm really just trying to work and make the guests happy. Whatever one wants to do in their personal life, they do it. - I don't ----ing know, I feel frustrated. Like, I feel like I honestly do have to hold your guys's hand. Like, picking up after you guys ----ing constantly, and that's what I feel like. - I pick up after you, too. And all the time that you are sitting down in the crew mess with Adam that I work... - Oh, so it is frustrating to you? - No, it's not. I'm just saying this as fact. - It's not your place to comment on what your superior is doing. This is my home, this is my workplace. I am dating Adam. Did it affect any of our professional abilities? The answer is no. You started earlier and you said it didn't bother you at all, and now it does bother you. - Oh, my God, dude. - Coming up... - I would be very surprised if somebody flew to Corfu with cocaine. If there are illegal substances on board, it's very serious. - Are you okay? His eyes are rolling back in his head. in the crew mess with Adam that it... - Oh, so it is frustrating to you. - No, it's not. - You started earlier and you said it didn't bother you at all, and now it does bother you. - Oh, my God, dude. - We have one last charter left. I am, like, at the point where I just don't give a sh-- anymore, and I'm just gonna do my job and keep my head down and not tell you guys anything. - [ grunting ] Oh! - Remember how I told you, like, I didn't need... like, I didn't have an issue with Jenna? - Mm-hmm. - I just got, like, reamed out in the master. - Huh? No... - Oh, I just got... like, I'm a source, and all this sh--. And, like... - I told her it wasn't from her department. This whole thing's just escalating. - Do you know where she is now? - In the master. - Argh! - I'm sorry. - Don't apologize. - I don't like drama. - Um... do you wanna have a chat, the three of us? - Sure. - Do we need to bring Georgia? - No. - Let's move into the master. - Are you ----ing kidding me? Come on! - So, I wanna make sure that we're all on the same page, and that I'm not hearing one thing from you, something else from you. I'm not here to get in the middle of personal politics. My concern is can Jenna and Madison call a truce and get us to the finish line. - What I told you is verbatim what I told Glenn. He came to me after apparently having a conversation with Ciara that I did not know about. - But Madison, to be fair... - Mm-hmm. - ...I did feel that you had some issues, and you just didn't wanna voice them. - And you did have them, because you just sat in here and told me, "I don't have an issue, what you do on your own time is what you do on your own time." And then you flipped it and said... - I didn't flip it, I gave an exa... - Listen, Madison, I'm finishing my sentence. - Okay. - Why do you even have a ----ing opinion about this? It actually pissed me right off. - I don't. - Jenna, I can tell you that it was not from your department. So please don't take it out on Madison. - Honestly, I don't like any environment that would kibosh affection. - Do you understand how it looks when you're just, like, sitting on top of someone? Or, like, when you're laying on his lap or something, trying to talk to me, like, professionally? It's just, like... - You are... - I'm just saying... - ...a second stew. - Jenna, I'm getting the feeling now that you're being defensive. - I'm just lowering myself by even having this ----ing conversation. Are Adam and I ----ing in the crew mess? No, I'm sitting beside him and, like, holding his hand. I'm gonna show him some affection. Oh, sorry, I can't because Madison might have an issue with it. That feels sh--ty to me, and that feels like an environment I wouldn't wanna be in. - I just think you're justifying your actions. You're defending them, and they're indefensible. - It's sore! [bleep] ugh... - Dude, my leg is gone as well. - It's not as bad as Christopher's, though. - Cool, thank you. - Do you guys think that you can just keep moving forward? - Yep, sounds good. - Yeah, you say that, but obviously you're upset about it. - Well, I'm not gonna be happy, because my personal life has been affected. Just a heads up. - This side of Jenna is unacceptable. Unacceptable. And honestly, I'm in a tough spot right now. With one charter left, I'm not gonna make any dramatic changes to the crew. - All right, can we be done with this drama? - Yeah. We just have to get through this, yeah. - You in a funny mood? - Me? - Yeah. - What did I do? - Everyone's in a funny mood today. - I'm good. - ----ing Glenn is pissed off, Paget's pissed off, Jenna's pissed off. - We need to go get ready at some point. - The boat needs to be ready at some point. I don't really want to go to dinner tonight, we're gonna work through the night. - What time is it now? - It's a quarter past 6:00. - [bleep] There's no way we're going out tonight. - So how's it going out here? - We're not going out for dinner tonight, so we should be able to get most of it done. - So we'll keep Chris on board. We'll see what the MRI says. Maybe he can do night watch so Ciara doesn't have to be up at night. That's what we're looking at. - How did your MRI go? - Yeah, strange experience, but... - How do you feel compared to yesterday? - There's a bit more pain in my back now. - So what are you gonna do? You gonna go lie down again? - Yeah. - Until we get some news? - In less than 12 hours, we'll be up here again. - Please don't talk about that. - Whatever. - Down the hatch. - Two days. - I'm gonna touch your face in a nice way. - Adam, Paget, and Jenna, you guys have a minute in the crew mess for a quick preference sheet meeting? - Copy. - Here we go, the last charter of the season. - [bleep] yeah, it is! - Yeah, baby! - Okay, so we have Nicole Gary from Manhattan. Nicole is a high-end real estate broker and CEO of the luxury real estate company Nicole Gary Team. Joining this vacation will be her good friend and neighbor Noelle, Billy, Jeanette, and Nicholas Buchanan. - Noelle has done a lot of motor yachting, but never sailed before. She's hoping that the service is even better on a sailing yacht. - Hm. - She's gonna be in for a big surprise. [ laughter ] On night one, Nicole is requesting a pink party, complete with pink decorations and a pink, seven-course tasting menu, including pink dessert. - Uh-huh. - On day two, Nick wants to race laser sailboats with the help of the yacht crew. Where would that be? - That's probably gonna be up in Avlaki Bay, because there's shallow water up there and we can lay out a couple of marks, and... - Yeah. - So I'm thinking maybe we can set up a little regatta. - That's pretty cool. - Let's get back to it, we got a lot on... - All right. - ...to get ready for this charter. - Mm. [ coughing ] - Every course, pink? - I'll just tell you what I'm gonna do. So prosciutto's naturally kind of pink so we'll start off with, like, a folded prosciutto amuse bouche. I'll do a pink hollandaise, and then two desserts. I would hate for something positive, like Jenna and I's relationship, to leave a bad taste in Glenn's mouth. Despite the fact that we've shown a little bit of PDA here and there, there's no question that we're capable of doing our jobs just the way we are. - Cool. - Spanks. - I just want this to be over. - Hey. Hey, come here. - What? - Come here, come here. - I don't have time. - Ciara. - Just let me get on with work, please. - Just one second. - What? - Come here. I can... you're stressed. - I'm not stressed, I just wanna get on with stuff. Towards the end of the charter season, everybody's exhausted and can't wait to go on holiday, get off the boat. We are in that phase right now. - We're in it together, okay? - Don't pinch my cheeks. - Sorry. I love you. I'm sorry. - Yo. - Yo. - So I just wanna have a quick little meeting. [ sighs ] - So, I mean, I think it came up yesterday that I'm quite frustrated with certain things. Some things that can be improved upon. Sometimes time management is lacking. You don't move with much fire behind you. You're kind of, like, la, la, la. Walk with that purpose and intent of, like, okay, I'm getting stuff done. I think with you, I've seen you very easily get sidetracked. Try to stay focused on what you need to do and then get it all punched out, and then focus on the other stuff. - Every time I've expected Jenna to admit that she's wrong, she tries to chalk it down to professional working environment, this hierarchy, and your inadequate feelings. - Thank you. - Thank you. Last charter, baby. - To take no accountability, it's bullsh--. - Whatever. - Coming up... - There is an issue with my spine. - It's not feasible where we are to get someone else on board and bring them up to speed. - I just feel bad because we're already down to one person. - She's suddenly become quite - She's suddenly become quite the chief stewardess today. [ laughs ] - Mm. So many thoughts. - You go do other stuff, I'll do this. - All right. - I can do pillows. - Thanks for your help. - Yeah, no problem. Oh, that feels like a nice pillow. - Job ----ing done. - Interior, interior, we have some provisions on the dock. - Copy, coming now. - Whoops, thank you. - Thank you. - What is this? - Yeah. [ humming ] - How you looking, all right? - I honestly feel like sh-- today. - Georgia, you'll have to wash this guy out. There's, like, toothpaste in it. - Okay, sure. - Put away those waters. Those aren't for arrival. - Yeah, I didn't think so. - All crew, all crew, let's get changed up. We're expecting the guests in about 10 minutes. - Oh, my God, I'm so miserable. - Okay, these guys are gonna be coming up the dock in one minute. - Wow, it's just beautiful. - Is it hot enough for you guys? - Hello! - Hey, how you doing? - Great, thanks, how are you? - I'm Jenna, I'm the chief stewardess. - Nicole, pleasure to meet you. - Nicole, nice to meet you. - Nicole, I'm Captain Glenn, nice to meet you. Welcome to Corfu. - Here, this'll make it better. - It is super hot. - Billy. - Adam... Nice to meet you, Billy. - Welcome on board Parsifal III. We've got a lot of fun things planned for you. When you're ready, Jenna's gonna take you on a little tour of the boat, all right? - Thank you. - Thank you! - Thank you. - Hey-hey. - All right. This area is the fly bridge. - Wow. - Obviously tons of sun. - No bags for you. - Can I take the shoes? - Have we heard anything from the doctor? - Not yet. - So I wouldn't lift anything. - This is a great spot to sit while we're sailing. - Perfect. - I'll bring you to your rooms next. - I could get the heavy one. Done the luggage all ----ing season. - This is the master cabin. - This is beautiful! - Yay! - Make yourselves at home. This is your holiday, we want you to have the best time. - Thanks for the tour, we're excited to be here. - No problem. - It is, like, blue water. - Yeah, bro, it's blue water. What do you expect? - Okay, we're ready for snacks. - It's so beautiful. I've always dreamed of a job where I don't have to wear shoes. But then what would I do with my investment in shoes? [ laughter ] - Oh, that looks beautiful. - You got little snacks here. You got some tziki, some hummus, crudités. As far as tonight for dinner, we've got a seven-course, pink tasting menu. - Mm. - Pink food. - And it should be pretty fun. - So I read that you love lobster, and I have more lobster than you know what to do with. - So excited. - All right. - Thanks! - I've got a pretty sharp pain in my right knee. - Is that the same one as the hamstring thing? - No. [bleep] me. - Please don't leave me the only person on deck! - I won't, I'll fight through the ----ing pain. - Mm... there's something so special about a crisp apple. - Surely this isn't a skirt. [ laughs ] - That's a top, doll. Oh, this is really cute. - I'm just gonna stand by, just in case. - We're good, man. - All lines are off, Glenn. All lines are off. - Thank you. - Both anchors secure. - Glenn, Glenn, Pag. That's tender on a short tie. - Copy short tie. - It's a nice boat. - Yeah, and I'm glad that it was over 170. - Yeah. - I think I don't do well on something smaller. I've been doing this for 18 years... - Okay. - ...I've been boating all over. - Yeah. - This is kinda the way I travel; always have. - Yeah, yeah. - Let's get our suits on. - Watermelon's pink. I'm getting all kinds of ideas now. [ phone vibrating ] - Hello, Chris speaking. And that means... - Okay. - Can I still walk around and... - Thank you very much. [ sighs ] - I'm looking at your shorts. - What? - It's like a solar panel. - Well... - It looks like my SoulCycle bag. - ...if we run out of-- - It's perfect. [ sniffing, clearing throat ] - We need more chairs, guys. - Ah, no [bleep]s given... love it. - Paget, Paget, Jenna. - Go ahead. - The guests are looking for some more chairs forward. - Well, ----ing move them. - I feel sorry for him today. - Mm. - This is really smooth. - Isn't it? - Yeah. - Oh, thank you, guys. - Thank you, doll. - Pleasure, treasure. - How are you two doing for drinks? - Margarita's good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - So is this thing hard to drive, or what? - No, come drive. - Yeah, I wanna drive. Just turn it? - That's it. - The wheel's even carbon fiber, of course. - I wouldn't trust him too much. You know, keep an eye on him. - I have such a bad headache, ugh. - Go down for an hour or two, okay? - Awesome, thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey, Glenn, Glenn, you copy, Glenn? - Go ahead, go ahead. - Just letting you know the wind has picked up quite a bit out here. - Let's get ready to go sailing. - Interior, interior, it sounds like we're about to go sailing, if you'd like to start stowing some stuff. - Okay, thank you. - It's gonna be windy as [bleep] so I'll put on some hairspray. - Oh, yeah, the wind really did pick up. - Oh, it's perfect. - Chris, if you wanna come up, you can help call trim on sails. Gonna go off on port tack first. - Port tack first, okay. - Ooh, there's a bit of wind. - Sir Limp-a-Lot, how you feeling? - Eh. - I just feel like sh--. - Chris, if you could call mizzen. - I finished school and I went straight on to working on boats. - You ready? - Yeah. Since 2011, it's been my life. If this injury means that I can't go back to doing what I love... Okay, she's turning nicely. It's scary. Okay. - Okay, coming in on the main. - Putting up another sail. - I'm gonna go full hoist. - Okay. - There she goes. - Okay? Pag, if you wanna call it, I can't see anything. - Good. Engine off... we're sailing. - That's beautiful. Oh, now, this is fun... woo! - Oh, yeah. - Boy, I wonder how things are on the interior. - Oh [bleep]. - Okay, do you like sailboats better than motor? - This smile is the smile of panic. - Yeah. - Glenn, Glenn, Chris. Can I chat to you in the bridge, please? - Yep, on my way. Byron, can you take over for me? I've gotta go see Chris. - Copy, copy. - What's your symptoms? - Overheating, dizzy, headache. - What's going on? - So I just spoke to the doctor. - Okay. - There is an issue with my spine. - Uh-huh? - There is a... like, a collapsed vertebra, and... - That sounds pretty serious. - ...he said do not lift anything heavy. Then he recommends after this is over go back to the UK and see a specialist. - Oh, really? It's not feasible where we are to get someone else on board and bring them up to speed. This is a tough spot to be in. Let's have a look. Ah, here. - Ah, there, yeah. - That gives you an idea of where it is, too. This is all kind of uniform, and then here, it's squeezed, huh? - Yeah. - Wow. - Are you about to cry? - I just feel bad because we're already down one person. - So you wanna go that way... - Oh, that way, okay. - Yeah. When you give the boat a command, like turn the wheel, you've gotta wait about 20 seconds for it to respond, because it's such a big boat. - Get rest. Go and have a cold shower, put some cold towels on you. - All right, I'm gonna go chillax for a few minutes. It's so pretty. - [ humming ] - The doctor said do not lift anything heavy. - We'll work around that and we'll make it work. - Perfect. I'll maybe do the from 11:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.? - Yeah, I think that's a very good idea. - So I do the whole night shift. - And you can get your rest after that. - Yeah, perfect. - Yeah, excellent. - And then there was one. [ laughter ] - Oof... ah. - Glenn, Ciara's down as well. - What do you mean, she's on a break? - She's got... no, she's got really bad heatstroke. - Oh, really? - Yeah, she's in tears. [ sighs ] - Hey, Glenn, Glenn, you copy, Glenn? - Go ahead, go ahead. - Yeah, we've lost all our wind. - Copy that. - We've got 2.2 through wind. - So I go downstairs for two seconds... - Two seconds. - ...and you sail straight into a hole. So let's head up, and we'll put these sails away. Pag, if I can get you and Chris up for a sec? - I've gotta go back to work. - So they're gonna bring that sail in. - I'm going down and preparing for this evening. I'm gonna take a quick little siesta. - Pag, can you call the main, please? - Main down. - Are you still okay over here? - Yeah. - Probably come down a touch more. Yeah, now she's good... stop. - Okay, you can go relax, dude. Thank you very much for your help. - [ grunting, hissing painfully ] Oof. - Okay, let her go. Let's go out to four, out to four. - Yep. - Noelle, on the fourth course, will be having no goat cheese but instead, pink cream cheese. - Glenn, Glenn, Glenn, that's four shackles at the water. - Okay, shutting down main engine. - Some of the guests have joined the nap train. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - So we're not eating at 8:00. - Well, not 8:00. - Eight-thirty. - How's it going? - Too much sun... 12 hours in the sun is enough. When are you leaving? Are you planning to come back this winter to find work, or are you just gonna stay? - I wanna give the music thing a bit of a bigger shot now. - I will miss you. - I know, I'm gonna miss you too. - You're one of the goodies. - Not saying much, but I'll take it. - It's gonna be a doozie. - Hey, look... pink fish. [ humming ] - Pink smoked trout dip. - How you doing? - Better. [ snoring ] - Hi. - How you feeling? - Good, I just needed a nap, I needed to cool down, so... - All right, girl. - Is it okay if I go down? Back up at 11:00. - Mm-hmm. I'm just gonna put some cushions away and just batten down the hatches. - I'd like to eat something. - Jenna? - Yeah? - Do you have any guests, like... - There's two in the lounge. - I cannot wait. I cannot wait. - So I should keep things cold, is what I'm asking. - Yeah. - Copy. - Oh, my God. Nobody told me to wake up. I've gotta shower. - What? - I was sleeping upstairs. - You were sleeping upstairs? - I'm gonna take a shower. - On ----ing standby. - Oh, wow... - Like, inside the horse, or outside? That's tragic. - Nicole just got in the shower 10 minutes ago. - Let's go outside. - What time do they eat? - It was supposed to be 8:30 or 9:00, but not all the guests are up yet, so... - I am just not used to this. I need to chill the [bleep] out. - What? - How are we doing? - Eh, good enough. - We are about to pass out from starvation. - Hello. - Hi. - How's it going? - It's going. - Well, good night. - How long do you think you need? I'm just gonna give Adam a heads up. - [ yawning ] Oh, boy. - Twenty minutes. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Holy [bleep]. Come on. - She's up in five minutes. - What's up with this? - I don't know. - Ten o'clock? Sh-- dude. - I bet Adam is, like, exhausted, waiting for the food. - This might be the latest one we've had all season, seeing as how we got seven courses to go. I'm not being some diva chef about this situation. I care about the food that I'm putting out. The problem is it's gonna go bad. Like, I don't get a second chance. Let's go! - I just have to put on a little concealer. - Let's just start. - Let's just let her come for course six. - Coming up... - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - His eyes are rolling back in his head. - Okay, I think they might be on drugs or something. It's really weird up there. [ sniffs, sighs ] - We have seven courses to come - We have seven courses to come out, and it's 10:00 at night. - All right, Nick, I'm just putting on my dress, and I'm coming. It's like my prom tonight. [ giggling ] - Let's go. - Is she coming up? - She's scooting in her dress right now. - Sure, have a seat. - Yeah, mm. - Adam, Adam, Jenna. They're about to sit. - Bullsh--. - Let's bring all seven courses at once. - Are we sure she hasn't gone overboard? - I don't know, but I'm not gonna find her. I'm gonna eat. Okay. - Can you check the bins in the galley, please? - Yeah. - They're all seated. We're just still waiting for primary to come up. They're all riled up. - "This is ridiculous. I'm hungry!" [ laughs ] - Oh, there she is! - Yay! - How are you? Sorry I made you wait forever. - Look at her. Come on. - It's 10:00, dude. - Sorry. - We're just hungry. - Hangry? Well, nobody woke me up from my nap. - Love the pink dress. - Thank you... pretty in pink. Uh, that boa, I'm gonna have to try it on later. - Oh, you will. - You and your ----ing boa. - Thank you for being so enthusiastic about the pink, I love it. - Madison, Madison, if you wanna come to the galley. All right, they are good to go. - Oh, boy. - Cheers. - Woohoo! - So the first course is prosciutto, parmesan, and truffle. - Yeah. - Okay, send it. - ♪ Feels as if I'm drowning ♪ - Oh, wow. - Oh, pretty! - Beautiful. - This is so pretty. - So for your first course, you have prosciutto, parmesan, and truffle. - Imagine the world in pink, all the time. What a pretty world it would be. - First impressions? - Happy. - You need a Red Bull? - No. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - His eyes are rolling back in his head. - May I take your plate? - Yes, thank you. - Okay, I think they might be on drugs or something. It's really weird up there. - A lot of that happens when we're not looking. What's happening? - Glazed eyeballs... they're very strange. - Well, I'll get up at 6:00, so I'm going now. Then you get up at 7:00, okay? - That works. - Cool. - Warm the bed up for me. [ laughs ] - Sleep like a ----ing baby tonight. - Madison, Madison, Jenna. Come to the galley. - On my way. - Okay, so this is? - Grapefruit salad, grapefruit vinaigrette. - Are you okay? - Huh? - I'm seeing your eyes. - Do you want it vertical or horizontal? - It looks so pretty. - This is a grapefruit salad with a grapefruit vinaigrette. - It looks so good. - This is so good, oh, my god. - Where's Billy Lolly going, to jump in the water? - I'm going to the bathroom, everybody. Relax. Could I piss? Goddamn it. - He's being delirious. - I was a little worried. He's sitting there like... - He'll be back in five minutes. - Okay. [ sniffs, sighs ] - Thank you. - Smoked trout and caviar crostini. - Yep. - Oh. - What is this? - Yay! - Oh, my God, it's so pretty! - This is a smoked trout... - Oh, wow. - ...and dill, with caviar and crostini. - This looks so good. I think we might need to take Adam back to New York with us, and like, bring him to the Hamptons for a week. - Do you need this towel, still? - Nope. - I'm listening to a book now about your inner fish. [ yawning ] How we all evolved from fish, and we still have some of the sh-- from fish. It's ----ing incredible. - Send it. - Oh, my God, how amazing is this pink meal? - This is beet salad with goat cheese. - I like the way he painted the plates with stuff. - It's all about the pink party. - It's art. - What's up? - Oh, nothing, just killing this seven-course, pink tasting menu at the moment. - I took everything out of the watch desk so you don't have to climb in and out. - You're amazing. - This bathroom is not done at all. - Yeah, I know, that's what I just said. - How are you guys still down here when it's almost 11:00? - I did that room... - Yeah. - ...so, like, that room is done, like... - But that took you an hour and a half? - I didn't even start till later... - Okay. - ...because I was helping with service. It's not worth it at this point in the season for me to, like, deal with Jenna. Glenn wants us to work together, so I'm just gonna bust my ass and, like, be professional. I mean, I don't know what to tell you, like... - Okay. - I'm sorry. - Cap... I got you, dude. - Okay, so this is lobster with... - Lobster, pink potatoes, asparagus, béarnaise. Send it. Thank you. - Thank you. - Oh, it's a lobster, yay! - This is lobster with pink potatoes. - Oh, that's gorgeous. - I don't think this is a Mediterranean lobster. What do you guys think? - Something... oh. - [ sniffling ] - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. - All right. - What's going on over there? Some shady stuff, huh? - No... no shady things at all. - No shady. - We're good. - If guests do bring drugs on board, it can put us all at risk of being charged. So if I suspect something and Chris suspects something and we didn't say anything about it, the onus is on us. [bleep] - It's all about the pink party. - What's going on over there? Some shady stuff, huh? - No... no shady things at all. - No shady. - Taking care of friends, we're good. - I'm not gonna wake up the captain right now. I'm not gonna escalate this situation. It could be nothing. But if it is something, it's important that Glenn makes that decision himself. How's the main course? - Oh, my God, delicious. - It's really good. - Phenomenal. - It was so good. - Good. - I'm still eating it. - Send it, thank you, ladies. - Thank you. - So we have watermelon granita. - Oh, my God, that looks so pretty! - Oh, my God! - Are you, like, really tired? - Yeah. - Yeah, me too. - This is so spectacular. - Yeah. - All right, guys. - Oh, yeah, Adam, what do we got, come on. - Number seven... so was that pink enough for you? - It was super pink, come on. - Yes, sir. - I'm glad you enjoyed your dinners. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. - That was probably the best meal I've had from a chef. - Great success? - Great success. - Great success. - Great success. - Nailed it. [bleep] yeah. - You did it. - Two more meals. - All right, I love you guys, good night. - Good night. - Night. - I'm tired. - It's so early. What are we doing? - I'm going to bed. - All right, sleep well. - All right, good night. - Where are you going, Mr. Lolly? - Going out of the room, come on. [ laughing ] - [ sighs ] [bleep] I love you. - Must be be your last day of the season. - Yeah. Pretty stoked. - Paget, Glenn. Can we get a couple of paddleboards and one of the doughnuts in the back? - Copy, on my way. - Good morning, you guys ready for breakfast? - You... - Breakfast whenever you like, and then water toys. And the sailing thing will be from 3:00 to 6:00. - Okay. - Where are we gonna have breakfast, outside? - Yep, just on the back table there. - Okay. - I'm about ready for you. Send it. - Ooh, my God. - Gosh! - Avocado toast, yum. - Stop it! - Good morning. - Morning. - Man, you're just in time. - Perfect, let's do it. - How'd we sleep? - I'm not sure we went to sleep. - Oh, didn't sleep. - ...oh, my god. - Oh, I know how those nights go. - Hey, Glenn. - Go ahead. - Quickly, can I have a conversation? - All right, guys... well, I'll let you enjoy your breakfast. - Thank you. - I don't like to be accusatory, but, uh... I saw it, and so did Chris. - What did you actually see? - Well, I mean, there was white powder around his ----ing nose. - One nostril? - Yeah. - Why the hell am I just hearing about this now? And there's no way it was makeup? - It's white ----ing powder. - If there are illegal substances on board, it's very serious. I can't think of anything worse than the boat being confiscated and me losing my license or even going to jail. And you feel pretty confident that that's what it was? - Based on his behavior, yes. But then he did eat a full seven-course meal, so I don't know. - These are the best croissants I've ever had. [ knocking ] - Chris? - Yeah? - Sorry to wake you up early, but Jenna said she saw something yesterday on one of the guests. It would have been good to know about it in the moment, because if I saw it with my own eyes, it makes it a little different. If you had to bet money, what do you think it was? - Yeah? - Yeah. - How early do you want me to black out? [ laughs ] - All right, thanks. - Come on. - All right, we're gonna paddleboard it out. - Are we ready to paddleboard? Are you ready to watch us fall? We thought this was, like, the spray that you don't have to rub in. - It's okay if you get a little wet. It's only water if you fall in! No wake. Come on. - No I haven't, but to be honest, I haven't really been opening any drawers or anything. - Yeah. - I've only really done surfaces. - I might be mistaken, but aren't you two supposed to stand up? [ laughs ] Come on, it's okay if you fall in the water. Stand up! She's, like, so slow. - Are you gonna jump in? - Well, everybody else is doing it, why shouldn't I, huh? - Peer pressure. - I would be very surprised if somebody flew to Corfu with cocaine. Whereas the alternative... somebody has a prescription drug with them, and flies with it. There's no problem, and people fly... I'm sure people fly with Adderall all the time. So there's a chance that it's that. - You don't want to go around accusing a charter guest of using illicit drugs, if that's not the case. It's just literally the worst thing that could happen. God. - If it was just one crewmember, then it may be a bit different. But I've got it from two crewmembers now, and so I'm gonna speak to Nicole. If it's anything illegal, that'll be the end of the charter, immediately. - Look at her! - Nicole, do you have a second? - Sure. - If this guest goes ashore and snorts cocaine and comes back with a bit of residue on his nose, that is not my problem. But my problem is if he's got drugs on board. Because he's in deep sh-- if there's drugs on board in his cabin. [ laughs ] - Next week, on the season finale of "Below Deck Sailing Yacht." - I know that we joke around a lot on the boat as well, and I don't personally mind it, because... - Okay. Is there anything you don't want me to find? - My ----ing luxury yacht vacation is ----ing pretty much ruined. - Ciara? - Yes? - I kinda have to tell you something before I go. I admit to having a bit of a thing for Pag. - Georgia? - Yeah? [ sniffling, crying ]
