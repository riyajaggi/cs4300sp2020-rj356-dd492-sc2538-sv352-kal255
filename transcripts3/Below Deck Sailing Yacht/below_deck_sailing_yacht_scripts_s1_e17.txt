 - Previously this season on "below deck sailing yacht"... - It's not every day I'm attracted to my chief stew. - This is the first time I have a total connection with somebody. Wow, we ----ed the same person. - I knew it. - Don't laugh. - Maybe you can tell him that we were just joking about it, and I actually didn't have sex with johan at all. - My boss wants me to lie to her boyfriend-- - say it, quickly. - Flipping at you for not reacting the way he wanted

 for the flowers, that sort of thing... - [ clears throat ] - I need you to trust me, and I need to trust you. - I'm sorry. Gimme a hug, let's work this out. [ painful grunting ] - there is an issue with my spine. He said do not lift anything heavy. It's scary. Working on boats has been my life. - [bleep] [ grunting ] dude, my leg has gone as well. - Please don't leave me the only person on deck. - Paget, paget, georgia. - Does that irritate you at all?

 - I'm not jealous. And if he wants to [bleep] around, that means I don't want him anyways. - ♪ I'll do anything for you ♪ how is it possible for someone to be so like myself? - You wanna lay with me for 30 minutes? - Yeah. I've given the majority of my life to yachting, and I haven't felt like this for a long time. - Jenna basically has put madison on service and laundry-- - okay. - --So she can go take a nap with adam. - You and adam were on a break at the same time. That's drawing attention. - I don't like any environment that would kibosh affection. - You're justifying your actions. You're defending them, and they're indefensible. - I just don't give a sh-- anymore, and I'm just gonna do my job and not tell you guys anything. - Last charter of the season. - [bleep] yeah, it is. - Yeah, baby! - Nicole gary, from manhattan. - On day two, nick wants to race laser sailboats. - Maybe we can set up a little regatta. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - His eyes are rolling back in his head. [ sniffling ] - I don't like to be accusatory... [ sniffling, clearing throat ] - he's in deep sh-- if there's drugs on board in his cabin. Nicole, do you have a second? [ laughs ] - nicole, do you have a second? Thank you. - Why don't you have a seat? - Okay. - I really hate to bring this up, but a couple of crew saw one of the guests with a white powder around their nose. - Seriously? Who? - Billy. - Like, I can't believe that. - I wanted to speak with you first, because... - Yeah. - ...You're the primary charterer. And when that's reported to me, I'm obligated to get to the bottom of it. If there is drugs on board, it's the end of the charter. - Well, I really hope that's not the case. - I'm really sorry, but obviously the first thing I check is do they really think what they saw is what they saw, and they've both confirmed that they definitely saw a white powder. - We definitely don't want this charter to be over... - Yeah. - ...And I really hope that's not the case. - No, so I think the next thing would be to ask billy to come up here... - Yeah. - ...And then maybe he has some sort of explanation. - Yeah. - Let's go. I hate to have to do this. I want these guests to have a good experience. But cocaine is a big problem. - Billy, can you come up here, please? - I could easily lose my license, and possibly to go jail. [ sighs ] - we need to talk to you, please. - Okay, as I was saying to nicole, a couple of crew yesterday saw evidence of a white powder around someone's nose, and that someone was you. - Okay, I tell you right now... - Okay. - ...Hand to god, on my mother's grave, I didn't bring any drugs on this boat. - Any idea what it could have been? - No. - I'm gonna start by having a look in your cabin, and-- - yeah, that's fine. - Okay. Let's go down. - Come on. - ♪ now what I need you to tell me ♪ - interior, interior, glenn. Can I get a beach towel up to the saloon as quick as possible, please? - Of course. - Madison, would you come and be a witness, please? - Sure. - One charter, one guy's smoking a rolled-up joint, and I just walked up and pulled it out of his mouth and chucked it in the sea. And I said, "if I see that again, you're all off the boat." because if authorities come and find drugs, it's a big deal. All right, where are your bags? - So this one's mine and then that bag over there is mine. - Okay, I'm gonna just start looking through. Is there anyone you don't want me to find? - No, bro, whatever you wanna pull out. - Mm-hmm. - Just looks like tylenol. What's in here? - Gold bond powder. - It's just so uncomfortable. - Everything will be okay. - I hope so. It's crazy. - I didn't find anything. - I don't have anything to hide. - I apologize to you. - It's all good. - I'm still a bit concerned that... Of what they saw. - I don't know what to tell you. - Okay. All right, thank you very much. I get a little disappointed that I don't find anything. But I send a message that if they still have any left on board, that they'll get rid of it. - We don't know. - You okay? - It's so hard to get up on. - I... I don't even wanna be on the boat anymore. - So literally they just, like, searched through all his stuff. - What'd they find? - Nothing. - Let's just keep them drinking. - Okay. - You know, I had an observation of something, and then I feel an obligation to tell glenn. But I certainly don't relish ruining this charter guest's vacation. - Margaritas? - Yes. - This is for both of you. - And pink straws, perfect. - I just wanted to come on this boat and enjoy time with my friends-- - sorry. - --And not be stressed out. - We wanted to go out on a high note, and we'll probably go out on an awkward note at best. - Just in case you wanted a little bubbles to indulge. - Aw, you're sweet, thank you. - This whole situation literally shook me up so much I didn't even, like, have a-- - that's why I brought some ice. - Thank you. - Without finding anything and him denying it, there's not much I can do. - I know. This just, like, really puts a damper on the last charter. - How you doing? - Very good. - Just so you know, I talked to the guest in question, and I searched the cabin. I didn't find anything. So, at this stage, we're just gonna leave it at that. - How's it going out there? - Breathe it in, breathe it out. And then look at where you are. - I'm probably getting her fired up, so I need to stop. I'm just gonna be quiet. - Yeah, I kinda just wanna relax and enjoy... - Okay. - ...Our day. - Jenna, jenna, glenn. - Go ahead, glenn. - What time are you guys starting lunch? - In about 10 minutes. - Okay, copy that. - The guests are pissed, the crew morale is in the dumps. We have busted our ass all season long. It would suck if the last charter of the season's the one that goes sour. I gotta kill it. - Hello? - Hey, john, it's glenn. We're anchored in avlaki bay. Are those two lasers ready? - Yeah, we just have to put up the sails. - Perfect. Deck, deck, deck, can you go off to get the two lasers? - Copy that. I'm gonna go grab the sailboats. - Okay. - Do you guys wanna make your way to the table for lunch? - Y'all, I'm actually hungry. - Yum. - There we go. - How we doing, everyone? Got another spread for you. The ceviche was locally caught. This is macadamia nut-crusted bass, carnitas here. - Excellent, another feast. - Cool. - Yes. - Thanks, adam. - Let me know if you guys need anything. - All right, will do. Thank you. - We will, thank you. - You want some of the ceviche? - This is excellent. - You're not eating? - I'm really not that hungry. - This is amazing food. - Cheers, mate. - One more meal! - Yummy. [ grunting painfully ] - ciara, ciara, pag. That's me coming back with the two sailboats. If you can give me a hand when I get there. - I'm full. - Is it time for the regatta? - The sailing starts from 3:00 to 6:00. And then coming back for the greek party. - Thank you. - All right, let's go. - Let's set up. - Gonna give you this one first. - I think it's made to lace through the back. - I think it is. I mean-- - yeah. - But I think it looks pretty like this. - I do, too. You're rocking it. - You have good fashion sense. - You're rocking it, girl. - Thanks. - That boat's ready. - You wanna do, like, a little drink called, like, parsifal cup drink. You can make something up. - Okay. This is an utter disaster. Madison, what can you do right now to appease the guests? Get 'em drunk, get 'em fed, get 'em off, get the tip. [ makes cymbal noise ] the parsifal cup cocktail. - Thank you! - Oh, my. - Chambord, some pineapple juice, and a little bit of lemon. - Sounds excellent, thank you. - You're so welcome. - How they doing up on the foredeck? - Really good, they're really happy. - Are they? - Yeah. - Let's get this regatta started. - Yeah! - [bleep] this, where's the captain at? - Billy. - Mm-hmm. - I get you're doing your job... - Mm-hmm. - ...And it's a serious thing. - Mm-hmm. - But I'm pretty ----ing offended. - Yeah, I'm really sorry for that. But we have a blanket, zero tolerance policy. - Yeah, I get that. - Just because I didn't find it doesn't mean it's not on board. - I realize. I was pretty ----ing drunk last night, but that was it. My ----ing luxury yacht vacation is just ----ing pretty much ruined. - I was drunk last night, and that was it. Nothing's here, nothing ever was. I don't even know what to do anymore, I'm so offended. - Charter seasons are defined by the way they end. If we implode this close to the finish line, that's how we'll always remember this season, so I wanna avoid that. I have to do what I have to do. - Un----ing-real. - [ clears throat ] - billy, would you like something to drink, you want another water? - No, I'm good. - Ciara, paget, byron, can you come and see me in the wheelhouse, please? - Yeah, copy, I'll be there in one minute. - Copy. - I wanna talk about this regatta. The chance of us having success is gonna be big smiles and happy faces. We gotta upsell it. Now, I think it's an opportunity for us to finish on a high note. - Cool, let's do it. - All right, this is the course. So, start is here. There's gonna be a fender that we're gonna anchor in this area. We're just gonna go around the fender and finish anywhere on this line. - All right, well, shall we go blow up the fender? - Yeah, let's get that started. - Have you ever seen the girls wet swiffer this? - I clean it. - It's on their daily tasks. I need to know. - No, I've never seen it. - Okay. I love doing this. - Please, god. - Yo. - Yo. - When was the last time you wet swiffered this? [ sighs ] I don't think I have, other than this. - So that's on your to-do. Twice a day, every day. - Gotcha. - "I don't think I've ever done it." [ laughs ] - okay, you can roll... Get ready to do the start. - Copy that. - Course all set? - Almost, almost. Once everything's set, we start here, go up there, around the fender, and then straight down on this side of the boat to finish. We got two boats. Who's gonna be racing? - Right here, right here. - You're going with paget, billy's going with byron. So whenever you wanna jump in, you get to go. All crew, all crew, come up and let's watch the race. - All right, if you want to jump in on this side. You'll need to keep your weight fairly close to the center at the moment. - I love racing these. I spent my childhood capsizing and racing friends. To see the guys out on the lasers is heartbreaking. I wanna be out there. - There you go. - Perfect. - You're welcome to watch from up here, or if you like we can put you in the committee boat. - Let's do it. - Of course I get stuck with the guy we just searched for drugs. I just hope and pray that I don't piss this guy off any more. - This is really awesome. What do you think? - They ready? - Okay, cool. [ ship's horn blares ] - yeah! - So he's first to start. - That was really good timing on his part, eh? - Okay, and we have byron and billy, across the line. - I don't know. - Come on, pag. - Paget, paget, you guys can start whenever you like. [ laughs ] - there they go. - Woo! - Hey! - Come on, guys, come on. - You got it! - And byron is coming around the mark. - Ooh-- - [ all ] oh! - Oh! - Yes! - You okay? - Yeah. - Team paget, that's your big chance, that's your big chance. - Oh, byron has nearly got the boat back up. Oh, look at that, they're around the mark. - We're good! - Oh, they're passing. [ shouting ] [ ship's horn blares ] - yeah! - Cheers to living our best lives. - Woo! - Watch out! - I wanna punch paget. - Oh! [ laughter ] - woo! - That was a really good race, huh? - That was fun! - Good race, good race. - That was amazing. - Woohoo! - You guys have some more champagne for them? - Yeppers. - Absolutely! - Perfect. - Champagne for everyone. - That was a lot of fun, though, I have to say. - Good! - I'm gonna go shower and get ready. - Ooh, man. - Georgia, do you wanna help me do the table? - Yeah. - After all the awkwardness this morning, the guest vibe is getting better and better. At this point, it's all about the food. There's no room for any mistakes whatsoever. - Okay. - You're really good at your sand art. - How you doing? - Resting a little bit. - How does your back feel? - Yeah, I need to rest a little bit. - Okay, go rest. - Good race out there, champ. - Oh, nice. - We're ready for a party. - Pretty sunset. - It's ciara's birthday tomorrow, byron. - Is it? - What did you get her? - A leatherman? - You got her a leatherman? - Yeah. Don't look at me like that, like I'm a piece of sh--. - Who buys a leatherman for their girlfriend? - It's just... It's one of her presents. - What else have you got her? - Well, nothing yet. [ laughs ] - okay, and they're just moving towards the table. - Nice. - Look how pretty they made the table, guys. They did such a good job. - Are you excited for your birthday tomorrow? - Thank you. Your stuff's coming tomorrow. It's in the postage. - What? As much as my feelings for paget have increased, the closer we get to the end of everything, I feel like I have to say something. Oh, god, I don't know. - Tobes? Oh, he's the only man in my life. - I'm sure it is. It's almost over, thank god. I'm looking forward to some much-needed time away from this crew. - Dinner's just about to be served. - Is it plated, or-- - it's gonna be all spread out, because it's just this huge greek buffet. - Love it. - Okay. - Hey, guess what? - What? - It's our last turndown. [ singing ] - madison, madison, if you wanna come down to the galley right now, please. - Copy, on my way. - We can start going? - Yeah. - Okay. - Oh, awesome. Oh, perfect. - Thank you. - Here it is, guys. - Yay! - It's here, yay! - Wow. - One more run, there it is. - Oh, my gosh, so much. - Over here we have a chickpea salad. Lamb chops, braised lobster tails, lobster salad with yoghurt. - Thank you. - Wow. - Thank you. - All right, have fun. - Awesome, thank you. - Whoa, where do we start? - Last meal of the season - the lamb is excellent. - I can't get enough lobster. I think the lobster is just my favorite thing. - The lamb and lobster is phenomenal. - You guys... - The tail is amazing. - You wanna hit the floors and I'll get started in the other room? - I thought you'd never ask. - You know, the only thing that could make this day better is if they found someone to rub my feet. [ laughing ] - looks like we're gonna leave here around between 10:00 and 10:30. - Correct me if I'm wrong with speaking for everyone... I think we're done with the food, right? - Yeah. - Yes. - Perfect. - Okay. - We're tired and ready to be done. - We're trying to do everything we can to just make this a better circumstance, but I don't know if it'll be enough. [ sighs ] it's not a good way to go out. - Bye-bye. - [ sighs ] - coming up... - How do you guys think this season went? - Mm. - I know that we joke a lot on the boat. I don't personally mind it, because... - Good morning. - Happy birthday, ciara. - Thank you. - Morning, all. - Oh, hi. - Hi! I'm glenn. - Jenna, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. This morning, my expectation for the crew is don't let us down now. I mean, we're... We can see the finish line. You don't wanna run 25 miles and stumble in the 26th mile. Let's just keep it going and do our best and get there. - When do we start with... - Umm... Breakfast is gonna be ready. - Okay. - And then departure's around 12:00. - Oh, we have to leave? - Mm-hmm. I know. - Good morning. - Adam, adam, we can go on breakfast. - It's the last day of the season, mate. - Thank god. - That looks really good. - I'm trying something new. - Mm, the avocado toast again? - Yeah, dive in. - Sweet potato hash browns! - This is yummy. I think I'm gonna keep to the croissant for my carbs today, though. [ crunching ] mm! - All crew, all crew, let's start picking up. - If you wanna go help pack now. - Okay. - I would charter this boat again. - Right. - If the crew would have been subpar, it would have been a horrible experience. - Oh, for sure. - Seriously. - Glenn, glenn, pag. Transom is being lifted and tender is on a short tow. - Excellent, thanks, mate. - All right, we are underway. - Ugh, I'm gonna get on that airplane so drunk... - I'm gonna cry. - The thing is, we're all leaving. - Yeah, but, like [bleep] everyone else. - I mean, like, if jenna cries, it'll probably be because I threw a rock at her first. - Oh, wow, this is actually all gonna fit very nicely. - Are we there yet? - Yeah. - Dude, can you believe it? - Final drop off. - Oh, it's crazy. - [bleep] me. - At this point, chris and I are like old men, walking around, limping around. We're just trying to get on with it. [ grunting ] this boat right now is carrying more dead weight than byron's bad jokes. - [ grunting ] - you got another leg, right? - [ sighs ] - I think you can let go port now. - Okay, glenn, we're gonna have to come a little bit more to port, please. That's now 40. We're getting blown down to starboard a little bit. We wanna try and kick the stern up more to port. Twenty, glenn, 20. Throw it. Okay, glenn, your port line's going across now. Tie it off now. - [ grunting ] - okay, that's looking good. The stern now, two and a half meters, two and a half meters. - Okay, I'm shutting down the main engine. - Whew. - Finito. - Okay. - All crew, all crew, can we get everyone out on the aft deck to say goodbye to the guests, thank you. - Thank you. - Great time. - Have to give you a big hug. - It was so nice having you guys. - It was so wonderful. - You guys were a lot of fun. - Thank you so much for being the best captain. We're gonna miss all of you! - Yeah. - And this is for you guys. - Oh, thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Well, that's very... That's very kind of you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Our pleasure, of course. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - All right, thanks. - Thank you! - Run, glenn, run! [ ship's horn blares ] - all the crew, they're really just so happy to be, like, wow, we did it. - That's a wrap! [ cheering ] - woo, woo! - Hey we did a season together in the same department. - If we can do what we've just done, then the sky is the limit. - Okay, so our game plan is to have the boat fresh and ready for whatever she does next. - Ooh... I'm done. - All right, fine, let the real man show you how's done. - Are you excited? - Yes. - Mm, happy. - Done, done. - Mm, mm, mm. Mm, mm, mm. - Mm, mm, mm. - We just made it through one of the most hectic charters in this whole, entire season. - Can you shove over? - Oh, could not be happier right now. - How do you guys think the season went? - Mm, I've never really worked on, like, a big crew before. - Yeah. - Not that this is big, but... I don't know, what do you think, jenna? - I thought overall it was pretty good. Some things pushed me over the edge a little bit more than usual, I guess. - Oh, my god. - I know that we joke around a lot on the boat as well, and when we're all joking around, there's maybe nothing stopping that. I don't personally mind it, because... - You're the one doing the bullying? - [ scoffs ] you think I don't get ----ing bullied? - I've made it this far. - I don't personally mind it, because... - You're the one doing the bullying? - [ scoffs ] you think I don't get ----ing bullied? - You and adam have made, like, a lot of jokes at everyone's expense, talking about people in the galley, and then as soon as we come in, you, like, you undermine them because you guys have personal jokes and stuff. - Like, I was, like, scared to go in the galley sometimes by myself if, like, another person wasn't in there. - To be honest, like, that's my frustration coming out. Because a lot of times, I did feel like there were a lot of stupid questions. And adam's the person that I would vent to about it. Because they don't believe that they're familiar in the field is 100 percent justified. I don't think there's been a single day when I haven't, like, done my absolute best. - And I don't disagree with that. - We're done, we made it, let's go have one more good night. - Whew. Where's jenna? - Hi. - I guess that I can be very mean, and they felt afraid of me at times. - Dude! - I was dying. - I never want anyone to feel the way that jenna made me feel. It's how you treat people, it's how you talk to people, it's how you manage a team. Taking all of that, I think, has just opened my eyes to how I think things should be run. If jenna can be a chief stew, I know I definitely can ----ing do it. Let's go. - Ooh! - Ow. - Sorry. - When I started, it was very cutthroat. - You and I are the old salty dogs from yachting. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It was a totally different time... - Yeah. - ...To what it is now. Yachting is a lot softer than it used to be. There definitely needs to be a level of respect for each other. But with the younger ones, they just need to wind their head in a little bit and listen. - Just run away. Go and live in monaco. - Oh, dude! Lunch! Is this a burger of some sort? [ coughing ] - what's that? - Happy birthday. - You got me a gift! - Of course I did. - What is it? - Open it up. - Ha! Yes! - What is it? - It's a leatherman. - Yay! - Oh, how romantic. [ laughs ] sexy. - Oh, my god, this is the good one... Wow. I love practical birthday gifts. [ laughs ] - you're now officially part of the deck team. - Well, thank you so much. - It's a great present, eh? - When you don't know how to use any other tools, the leatherman's the job for it. - ♪ happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ happy birthday to you ♪ - oh [bleep]! - Go, go, go! - Go, go, go! - ♪ happy birthday, dear ciara ♪ ♪ happy birthday to you ♪ [ cheering, clapping ] - all crew, all crew, can I get everybody in the saloon for a charter debrief, please? - Copy, copy. - We got through the final charter. It was definitely a challenging charter. We had a little situation, but it seemed like we still finished on a really high note. They left us $15,000. That's 1,660. - Hey! - Each! - Wow, that's not bad. - Okay. - Not bad at all. - I am shocked at how big this tip is. I feel such a sense of relief. - Regarding the totals for this season, each of us is walking away with more than $16,000 in our pocket. - Woo-ee! - As a team, we earned $143,000. - Wow. [bleep] - that's a testament of how well we work together as a team. - Thank you, glenn. - Thank you, glenn. - I have a little surprise. We're going to a beach bar and have our final night out together. - Yeah! - Are you coming? - Of course, of course. - Yes. - Yes! Thank god. - Of course I'm coming. Let's get as much done as we can tonight. - Let's go do it. - What is everybody doing? Let's go. - We're trying to pick which champagne we want. - No! - Serious road tripping to do. - Mm-hmm. - This season, jenna and I have had incredible times, we've had some emotional times, but at this point she's the closest anyone in my life has gotten to me being willing to say "I love you." - yeah, show me where we're going. - Take this coast road... I don't give away my heart easily. It's hard to believe sometimes. - [bleep] I can't ignore my feelings for paget anymore. I've had this weighing on me for a while, but I also feel like I have to tell ciara, because she's gonna find out eventually. Having to admit to one of your friends that you've got feelings that are disloyal to them is just terrifying. What are you doing? - Emptying the hoses. - Want help? - Yeah, if you could start coiling, clockwise. - It just keeps getting so knotted and twisted, it's pissing me off. [ laughs ] - yeah, it's a great birthday so far, isn't it? - Oh, it's amazing. - Ciara? - Yes? - I kinda have to tell you something before I go. - What, what's up? - I wasn't really planning on talking about this, but... - Ciara, before I go... - What's up? - I admit to having a bit of a thing for pag. - Yeah, I already knew that. That's not a surprise. Super awkward. - I just kinda wanted to say it to you, that I haven't ever planned on doing anything. I've never wanted to, like, cross any lines or anything. So I just wanted you to know. I'm sorry. - I'm just gonna let my silence speak for itself. - I just felt guilty, really. - You're fine. - It's humiliating for me to open up like this, and for her to say, "yeah, I know, but I've never considered you a threat." it's very much twisting the ----ing knife. - Now is when I jump in. - [ shouting ] ah! [ laughs ] - shut up! [ laughs ] - I think I'm gonna turn my radio off for the final time. - Hey, you. - Hey... Um... - Yeah? - ...I had a conversation with georgia. About you. Georgia just basically apologized and said, like, "I admit to having a thing for paget." I just still want us to be friends." like... Mm. - I don't know. - [ stammering ] it doesn't matter. [ laughs ] - well, if it's any consolation, I really fancy you. - I would hope so. - Okay, let's go and get ready. - What are you gonna wear? - I don't know, let me see what I got. I don't have much. - Oh, you can't wear that. - You don't like that? - I think my grandma had that tablecloth. - Gravity! - Yes, byron! - Let's rock and roll. - Ready for the last supper? - I'm so glad you could be here for my birthday. - Come on in. - Come on, chris, darling. [ cork pops ] [ cheering ] - come on, madison. Oh, it's so pretty here. - Welcome to mikronisi. Take a seat anywhere you like. - Thank you. - Okay. - Wow, this place is amazing. - It's a nice setting, isn't it? - There you go. - Could I have the hawaii, please? - Yeah. - I'm gonna try that one for sure. - Okay. - Excuse me? Please stop bringing that up. - Just please stop. - Oh, is it... - It's not happening - stop. - Just stop. - Point taken. - Yeah, there we are. Good. - Thank you very much. - Okay, high point of the season, starting with chris. - The first time we got the sails up. Once you get those sails up and you get those engines off and you're heeling over, just the feeling of the sea, the power of the wind. - Pag? High point. - Probably for me was the regatta. - Even though you lost. - Even though you lost. - Adam? High point of the season. - Getting to meet this young lady. - Yeah. - The only correct answer. - Answer wiser, mother----er. - You guys blew me away from the very beginning, the people that I knew and the people that I'd just met. So I just wanna say congratulations on a great season. - That was really, really nice. - To that, I would say salud. - Chin-chin. - Yeah, chin-chin, cheers. - At the beginning of the season, we had the core family of the boat. - Oh, byron! - But wit new crewmembers coming in, they've quickly become like family. We don't always get along, just like you don't get along with all your siblings. But overall, I think we have a fantastic family. Anyway, I'm outta here. - Nice. - You guys... - Thank you, glenn. - All right. - Bright and early. - My boob just came out. - That's great. That's great conversation, thanks. - I'm looking away. - Well, guys, do you think georgia's gonna miss an opportunity to play the guitar? [ laughs ] - as your number one fan, could I have a request of a song? - Yes. - The one, um, I... It's been in my head all day, but now I can't ----ing think of it. - Just start playing, and I'll see if it's the one. [ playing guitar ] - that's the one. That's it, that's the one. - ♪ and let's step away for a minute ♪ ♪ I need to tell you something ♪ - ♪ I need to tell you ♪ - [bleep] you, it's gonna be... It's a really good song. - ♪ more than I know ♪ ♪ scared if you leave, then my heart will explode ♪ - oh, god, oh, god. If I never have to hear this song again, it would be way too soon. ♪ I need you to tell me that you won't ♪ - ♪ won't break my heart ♪ ♪ baby, I do ♪ [ cheering, laughter ] - there you go, cheers. - Woo! - Does anybody wanna dance at some point? This is a dirty bass right now. - It is. - I'm liking a dirty bass. - Anybody else? No? - You sure you don't wanna come? - Ugh, I just don't wanna dance. [ club music, chatter ] - ciara's totally, like, a little girl smitten with him, and I think he's just, like, trying to... As it was very apparent tonight for me, for some reason. - Boo! - Ooh! - There you are! - They're, like... - Yeah. - Thank you. I'm going to the bathroom. - Where's, um, uh, what's-her-face? Uh, georgia? - Yeah? - Well, I really wanna tell you that, um... - Uh, georgia? - Yeah? - Well, I really wanna tell you that, um... - Yeah? - Uh... Nothing. - Tell us more. Make my night. [ laughs ] - forget about it. - Yeah? Yeah? [bleep] - do you love me? - Of course I do. - Are you happy with my birthday? - I... I'm happy if you're happy with your birthday. [ laughs ] let's go. - After this song. - No, let's go. - Well, let's go, guys. Let's get into the ----ing van. - I can wait 24 hours. - Good morning, kids, how we doing? - My head is killing me. - Uh, I bet. - So many good clothes I never got to wear. This season's been great, apart from destroying my back. Well... - Look after your back, chris. - Oh, I will. This injury has put a stop on my career, which is... It's scary for me. I don't know what's gonna happen. - Come here, you big, hairy man. I'm gonna head back to the uk, see a specialist, get my back sorted, and hopefully come back better and stronger. - All right, time to go. - All finished, bud? - All finished. Dude. - I don't shake hands, come here. - The crew this season have been great. They're mostly capable. Thanks for a great season. - You too, byron. - And I'll never pass up an opportunity to work with glenn. - All right, man, good, thanks for everything. - Thank you. - I really, really appreciate it. - We've made some great tips, but I just can't wait to get ashore and be with my wife and daughter. - Here's daddy, look. Hi! - Hello, my love. Hi. Hello, my darling. You're all pretty. Hi, you're so pretty. - How the [bleep] did I get everything in one suitcase? I've learned that I think I'm more sensitive than I thought I was going in. Peace out, girl scouts. - Is this it? - This is it, man. I take things too personally, and I shouldn't. I think we've come a long way since the beginning. - We've come a long way. -[bleep], man. It's been a ride. You're coming with me, honey. - Been waiting to hear that all season. - Ha ha! I'm gonna miss georgia the most, because I feel like I found a sister. I know that it's someone that I'm going to have in my life for the rest of my life. This sucks. [bleep] this. I'm over it! [ grunting ] - oh, good, just the man I was looking for. Don't you want to follow me to the fly bridge? - Yeah, I'll follow... Yeah, I'll follow you. - Yeah? Over the season, paget and I formed a really great, strange, scary connection. I don't know if I'm crazy, but I just feel like I have to put it out there, because I never will get a chance again. Even if it's at the expense of my own ----ing dignity. - Oh, is this your goodbye? Is this your official goodbye? - Yeah, this is officially it. I was gonna say goodbye to the people that I cared about, like, in, like, letters. - That's sweet, though. - So it's generally just saying, like, I'm very glad to have met you. I haven't really felt like anyone's gotten me the way that you do, like, in a while, and, um... - Um, it's just nice to know that there's someone out there that does get me, because usually I just feel like no one will think my terrible jokes are funny. And you've mean a lot more to me than I think you realize. - I have to say this... Ciara did tell me that at some point in the season you might have had some feelings... - Well... - ...For me, or... I just wanna let you know that it obviously is very difficult for me to... In this life, I can never have, obviously, acted on that. - Yeah. - I feel pretty guilty, because there's someone in front of me who, under all the humor and the jokes, there's a really sensitive person there. And she's just looking for somebody who's gonna treat her the way she should be. If I knew when I was younger that when I got to this stage of my life that girls like you would have liked me, I'd have been, like, well, this life is gonna be easy, so. [ laughs ] she's talented, funny, she's good-looking. I mean, she's... She's available, to anybody. [ laughs ] but treat her well, please. Otherwise, I'll talk to you. It's really sad to see her go. [ sighs ] - the kicks. - Georgia, are you out? - I... I'm out. - I know it's been complicated. I said the same thing to madison, but... - It's the nature of the beast, I think. - It is, and I think you've handled it pretty well, too. - Thank you. When I started yacht as a sole stew, I thought having team members to rely on was gonna be better. But it's actually three times as complicated, I'm just saying. - Bye. - Good luck. - Bye. - Stay safe. - It's nice finding other hardcore bitches such as myself. [ laughter ] - love you. - Bye. - See you, georgia. - I'm gonna miss you. [bleep] me. [bleep] georgia. - So you're not even gonna attempt to carry any of it? - No, I'm not. Welcome to our life now. - Okay, paget and ciara, can we say bye? I found love in a hopeless place. I mean, like, how could I not love this season? I found adam. - It was a great season. - Absolutely, and honestly, you're a great captain. I've had my fair share, and you're one of the few that I would absolutely come back and work for. I feel like I really grew as a human, and I learned that to be vulnerable may not actually kill me. - Good hanging out. - Adios. - All right, all the best, huh? - Bye. - You about ready to go on a little road trip? - Yeah. - So... - Just us again. - Just us again, yeah. - The three musketeers. - Yeah. Thanks for a great season. - Thank you. - So glad you guys especially were here, and especially thank you for you coming out on deck. And I'm really glad that it worked out, that you really enjoyed it. - I'm actually really grateful that you pushed me to do that. I've realized that I'm more capable than I give myself credit for. [ grunting ] - being shoved out of my comfort zone has been really good for me. - You did a great job stepping up to the plate and making it happen. - Should we start putting the boat to bed? - Yeah, let's do it. - Yeah. - Let's go. - Good. Thanks, huh? - Thank you. - How good is this? - Look at that view, huh? - I know what I'll be doing. Whoa! - Holy sh-- balls! What time does the primary wanna eat? - I've got you some kindling. - You are so helpful. - I can light a fire. Want me to? - No. - Yeah. [ echoing crow caw ]
