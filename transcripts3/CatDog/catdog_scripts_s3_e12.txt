 mimes, cakes, presents... spare no expense! Dog, Dog, Dog, Dog... Mom and Dad don't want marching bands or expensive presents. Okay, mimes it is! Mimes it's not! Dog, Mom and Dad just want to spend a quiet, relaxing weekend with their boys, who are us. They don't want a bunch of hoopla. What am I going to do with all this hoopla? ( tires squeal ) ( banging on door ) Hmm, wonder who that could be. Knock, knock, we're here! ( both gasp ) BOTH: It's Mom and Dad! MOM AND DOG: Hi-ho diggity! Ow. ( laughing and exclaiming ) Yay! Whee...! Uh... okay... I got it, no problem. ( grunts ) A little help here! Whoopsie-daisy! Don't worry, Dad, I'm coming to get ya! Dad... you're beautiful. ( all laugh ) Aw... CAT: Uh. Ahem. Uh, Mom, Dad? You must be exhausted from your long trip so why don't you come on down and sit back and relax with these fabulous presents courtesy of your host and loving son Cat! But Cat, you said no presents. Here's something every father needs. A floating contour lounger with reclining lily pad. Say, now, that's fancy. And for the greatest mom in the world A super king-size multi-speed foot massager! Oh, Cat, you shouldn't have. Nothing but the best for my mom. Hey, I'm the only foot massager around here. ( giggles ) You stop. Not in front of the kids. Gee, Mom and Dad, I didn't get you any fancy presents. That's true. But you can have some of my favorite garbage. Oh... why, Dog, it's lovely! Ooh, the aroma... Flies! Now this is a present. ( laughs ) Well, I guess we know who they like best. ( laughs ) What, they like Dog best? Ha! Don't be ridiculous. They couldn't possibly like... Oh, Dog, you're the best! Oh! Don't take it so hard. Everybody likes Dog best. ( laughs ) BOTH: We like Cat better! What are you, nuts? Oh, oh! Let's play tag! Well, count me in! ( laughs ) Me, too! Tag, you're it! Slowpokes! Catch me if you can! Over here! Ha-ha, you missed me. Whoa... ah! ( both laugh ) Come on, boys. But what about my g... Catch me if you can! ( laughing and yelling ) Sorry. ( Mom and Dog laugh ) ( laughing and yelling... ) ( laughs ) ( grunting and groaning ) Hi. Follow me! Aah, aah, aah... ( laughing and panting... ) ( laughing and yelling ) ( video game music playing ) ( panting and gasping ) ( panting ) Oh, whee! ( horns honk, tires squeal ) CAT ( flat electronic voice ): My body. Aah! My body. My body. Aah! My body. Aah! My body. Aah! Aah! My body. Aah! My body. DOG: Hi ho diggity! CAT: My body again. My body. Aah! ( laughs ) Oops! Oops! Oops! Sorry! Ha! Sorry! Sorry. Oop, that tickles. ( laughs ) ( crowd yelling... ) Follow me! CAT: Wait, wait... Dad! Wait, Dad... ( whimpers ) Hee-hee. Aah! Aah... ( gibbering ) Ha-ha! Oh, hooray for you! ( Cat screams, lion roars ) ( Cat blubbering ) Oh, Dad? Come out, come out, wherever you are! Olly-olly-froggy-free! DAD: I really can't breathe. ( gasps ) Oh, dear. Ha! ( laughs ) Tag! You're it again, you're it again! Wait a minute, wait, wait! There are other ways to have family fun. How about... fishing? Mmm... gah! Ooh, good one, Dad! That hits the spot. ( gags ) Uh... I, I thought we were going fishing. We are... fly fishing! ( burps ) Go on, Cat, give it a try. But... I clean myself with this tongue. I want to try. All right, but there's an art to it. Let the tongue curl back in your throat. Ready, aim... Hiya, baby. Mm-gah! Aah! ( gulps ) Mm... ah... Yeah, tastes a little like chicken... if chickens were dung-eating, flying insects. ( all laugh ) DOG: Dung-eating insects... Okay, Dad, here I go! Hmm. Aah... Mm... gah! Looks like you inherited your daddy's tongue. CAT: Uh, well... since we don't get to see you that much, I I thought I'd take the liberty of putting together a little slide show to, you know bring you up to date on the accomplishments of your favorite son... and Dog. Now, this is just a little doodle I came up with. ( both laugh ) CAT: Oddly enough, I never had a lesson. Oh, Dog, you crack me up. ( frustrated growl ) Next, a little hike I made to the top of... Mount Everest! ( both laugh ) Dog, you're too much! Yeah, and then some. ( laughs ) Here I am accepting my perfect attendance award at the one-day driving school. They said it couldn't be done. Well, I did it! Ha! ( all snoring ) WINSLOW: Gee, you really know how to work a crowd. But don't worry, sooner or later your folks are bound to like you at least half as much as Dog. ( laughs ) Half as much... It can't be... I mean, I like me better than Dog... why don't they? ( projector clicking... ) ( growling louder and louder... ) ( laughs wildly ) I'm going to put an end to this "We like Dog better" nonsense once and for all! ( thunder booms ) Yeah, yeah, yeah... you sleep the deep sleep Mommy and Daddy's little favorite. ( laughs evilly ) DAD: Hurry it up, Mother. We need to get on the road. We're burning daylight. Coming, dear... oops. What in the name of chub? Oh, bad Dog, bad, bad digging Dog who digs! Huh... what I do, what I do? My RV, my beautiful RV! Oh, I tried to stop him, Mom and Dad but... he's a dog, and they're diggers, you know. Dog... how could you? With his front paws. He does it all the time. Gee, you're right. Look upon the paws of a digger. I must have done it in my sleep. I'm sorry, Mom and Dad. The important thing is, you took responsibility. I'm proud of you, Dog. Well, you should be! You what... huh... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...? Wait a minute. You still like him? Even after he said he did those things? It takes a big man to take responsibility for his actions. His actions? They weren't his actions! They were mine! I did it! It was me! I admit it, I admit it! Now you like me, right, right? Right? Huh? He gets this from your side of the family. I blame you! What did I do? You've been planning this all along! You outsmarted me with your stupidity! Wait a minute... that's brilliant. Oh, no... can it be you're smarter than me, too? Cat, your imagination is running away with you. Run away? ( laughs ) Good idea! You obviously don't want me around. All you need is Dog! Mom and Dad always liked you best! Always the dramatic one. Coochie-coochie-coo! ( laughs ) Oh! Cat, parents don't have favorites. We love you both the same. Right, Dad? Dad? A little help here! Your mother's right. Just 'cause Dog is cuter and funnier and more lovable has a better personality... ow! Dad... Okay, I was just kidding. I like you both the same, too. ( sniffles ) Promise? For reals? Oh, the joy of family! Oh, for the love of chub... ( grunting, engine revving ) MOM: Bye! Love you! DAD: So long, Dog. MOM: And you, Cat! DAD: See you later. MOM: Take your vitamins. Hey, uh, Cat? Yeah? Even though we're not supposed to have favorites you'll always be my favorite brother. Oh, I know... but you're not so bad yourself. Geez Louise! Somebody pass the hoopla bucket! I think I'm going to be sick. ( laughs ) Aah! A little help here! MOM: I'm positive we're going the wrong way. DAD: Oh, terrific. MOM: It's okay to pull over and ask for directions, honey. DAD: Fathers don't ask for directions. MOM: It's the other way, Dad. ( Dog munching and slurping ) Mmm, yummy!

Nah, hot dogs ain't made of dogs, ya knucklehead! Hot dogs are made up of a whole bunch of your little animal friends there. That's what hot dogs are made of? Bingo, Junior. Occasionally they throw in a mime for flavor. MERVIS: But mostly hot dogs are made of pigs. But Mervis, you're a pig. That's right, Dog. And you wouldn't want to eat me, would you? No, I would never want to eat one of my friends. MERVIS: Here's a handy list of all the animal friends you shouldn't eat. Remember, Dog, friends don't eat friends. ALL: Friends don't eat friends. Friends don't eat friends! Friends don't eat friends. Friends don't eat friends! ( gasps ) Cat...! What...?! What's the matter? Cat, our friends are made out of meat! Terrific.
