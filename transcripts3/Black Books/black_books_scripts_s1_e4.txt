 (Distantly) Fran! Fran!
 Fran!
 Bernard, Bernard! There you are.
 Right, wait till you hear this! No, me first!
 Seriously, I can't hold onto this one, I can't!
 My story goes first. No, MY story first!
 I'm not backing down. Well, neither am I.
 Well, you know what that means. Count to three?
 1, 2, 3.
 Aaaaagh!
 Say peanuts. Peanuts.
 OK.
 I want Manny in on this. Manny! No, he's no good to anybody.
 He stayed up all night with his birthday present.
 The complete set of 'The Sweeney' and an espresso machine.
 PHONE RINGS
 (Cockney accent) 'Ello? Wot? Do me a favour!
 It's a flamin' book shop! Of course we've got Jane Austen!
 DOOR OPENS
 Right...
 OK, my story.
 Alright. Imagine, yeah?
 Imagine you're a woman. OK.
 And now imagine... Wait, I'm still...
 OK...
 And now imagine you have a boyfriend.
 (Giggles girlishly)
 OK, and now imagine you see that boyfriend
 with another woman...
 (Whimpers)
 OK, my story! This is Peter we're talking about.
 Peter wouldn't do that to me. To you.
 He is scum. This morning, I was getting into my car...
 DRAMATIC MUSIC STING
 I just feel so...
 Awww.
 Now, my story.
 You know Gerald and Sarah?
 Gerald, uh, your friend...
 Friend? When I first came to London, he put me up.
 He lent me money, he helped me find a job,
 he helped me find this place - I was an incredibly good friend to him.
 And even though, even though I fancied his girlfriend,
 I did not make a pass at her.
 Well, once. Twice. A few times.
 But not after I realised just how angry it made him.
 Well, once, but only because... Get on with the story.
 OK, well, they invited me to a dinner party.
 And I went, had a good time, woke up with a bit of a hangover.
 Aaaagh!
 A...a big hangover.
 Alright, so I went to the chemist to get some Fizzygood.
 Some what? You know, Fizzygood.
 Fizzygood make feel nice. Oh, Alka-Seltzer.
 Yeah.
 BOTTLE POPS OPEN (Reads) 'Soluble'.
 Mmmph! Unh!
 It's a good feeling, that. A good feeling, this.
 (Mumbles) Gerald, Sarah!
 Thanks for the dinner party!
 Completely blank.
 Well, maybe they didn't see you.
 Could something have distracted them?
 Like what?
 Gunfire, was somebody firing a gun?
 Uh, let's see... Was someone firing a gun?
 Was someone firing... No, I don't think so.
 Manny, you look like you could use some sleep.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. In a little bit, in a little bit.
 Look, the thing is, right, this bloke behind me,
 behind me, DON'T LOOK!
 I reckon he's got a shooter.
 (Stage whisper) He's 100 years old!
 You're just wired from all-night coffee and cops.
 And so what? So they blanked you.
 So what? So what?
 They blanked me, that's like an awesomely powerful thing
 to do in civilised society.
 It's like, it's like when the Mafia
 send each other fish through the post...
 You must have done something awful.
 Something really awful? Do you think?
 Oh, you didn't do that thing, your "Belly Savalas" thing?
 No, I didn't do Belly Savalas.
 So, Bernard, being blanked really made you feel that bad, huh?
 Yeah, terrible.
 (Thinks) Hmmm... Manny, get some sleep.
 Something really awful... DOOR CLOSES
 God, what did I do? What did I do?
 Think, think! SLAM!
 GET DOWN!
 Thank you. Enjoy it. It's dreadful, but it's quite short.
 Manny, come over here.
 You want a case? I'll give you a case.
 Figure out what I did last night.
 OK, the dinner party.
 SQUASH!
 Ow...
 What?
 Sat on myself.
 Alright, let's start by reconstructing the evening.
 Who else was there?
 Well, Gerald and Sarah, obviously.
 What's their D-40? Well, they...what?
 What do they do?
 Oh, Gerald's a food writer. He had a big hit with that thing, you know?
 'Basic Meals for the Ultra-Rich'.
 And Sarah's an interior designer. She's on that program, you know?
 'Pet Surprise'. 'Pet Surprise'? What's that?
 Oh, you know the thing, they take the dog out for a walk,
 he thinks it's a normal walk, but when they come back...
 ..the kennel has a patio and French doors, you know?
 Yep. Yeah, yeah, then they take the blindfold off...
 Yeah, and he's like "Oh, my God," you know.
 Yeah, right.
 And there were other people there.
 You know, the sort of people who talk about salad for five hours.
 (Slurs) And then I won again.
 I mean, he was smaller than me and everything,
 he was only 80, but I still won.
 I won again and again and again and again.
 So, how much had you had to drink...
 ..before you turned up?
 Oh, you just assumed I'd been drinking, you just assumed.
 (Repeats insistently) How much? (Babbles)
 How much? A couple of bottles.
 Right. So you were in a bit of a state.
 No, I was fine.
 Oh, come on! THINK!
 DOORBELL RINGS
 (Babbles) Hi...
 Is this yours?
 Oh, er, yes.
 Misunderstanding, not her fault, she's young. High spirits.
 Thanks, officer!
 Try and keep it indoors.
 You see what you did? You made the police come to their house.
 No...there's more...
 Oh, God, Bernard, look at you!
 I'm a happy-go-lucky scamp.
 Exquisite gifts as always.
 You're very early, Bernard.
 Oh, oh, you remember Jimbo, don't you?
 I'm not sure. What do you do?
 No, he's our son.
 Oh, thank God! Ha, I thought you had a disease.
 Oh, this is a child!
 SARAH: Gerald, can you help me, please?
 Ah, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
 C'mere, we'll do the thing.
 Ah! Here.
 Here.
 There we go. Take it. Sssh! Take it.
 Now, did you...actually, Jim, can I have that back?
 Sssh.
 So, Jim, have I ever told you about the Old Country?
 The songs, Jim, oh, they'd melt your face.
 (Sings) # Oh, I live in a shoe on Moore Street
 # I'm a prostitute from Newry. #
 The child's involved somehow.
 I bet you he's done something and pinned it on me.
 Huh, it's always the children, isn't it, Bernard?
 Manny, if you have one more sip of coffee...
 WOMAN: Help, help, help!
 I got it!
 Help! Help! Police! Stop!
 COP SHOW CHASE MUSIC PLAYS
 MUSIC STOPS
 MUSIC STARTS
 (Inhales)
 MUSIC STOPS
 Yeah, and all my keys!
 My house keys, they were in it!
 How am I gonna get into my house without my keys!
 So it was a plain-clothes policeman, was it?
 Yes. Oh, Officer?
 Officer?
 Bernard?
 No questions, OK?
 Can you do my shoelace?
 No can-do, Neckface.
 What happened to you? What happened to you?
 No, no, you first.
 No, come on. Are you the next Bond villain?
 You look like you should have "Dorset 5 miles" written on you.
 Come on, you tell. Tell me.
 Don't mind this, it's a very dull story. Come on.
 No, no, you first. Come on.
 Tell me. No.
 Owww!
 Ow! Tell me. Tell me.
 Ah-ah-ahhhh!
 No, no, aaah! No!
 Aaaagh! OK, OK, OK, OK.
 OK.
 You remember this morning,
 when I was telling you about seeing Peter with that girl?
 Mmm-hmm.
 Well, I couldn't get it out of my head, so I shut the shop,
 went down the beauty parlour and got myself done.
 When the next thing, who walks by the window but Peter.
 Then I suddenly remembered what you said
 about the awesome power of the blank.
 And I knew I might not get a second chance.
 So, as usual you dealt with this in a mature, reasonable...
 Shut up.
 Anyway...
 Fran?
 Fran? Fran!
 BRAKES SCREECH
 THUD!
 You were knocked down, that's how... No.
 That's not how I got this.
 The way I got this was...
 No, it's too embarrassing. Come on, you next. What happened to you?
 Well, I was... PHONE RINGS
 We're closed. We're closed!
 Hello? Hello?
 Hello?
 Yeah, yeah, hello...Raiders.
 You just better watch it,
 or I'll be down your manor with all the other policemen.
 And we'll arrest your arse.
 Goodbye.
 You know, I thought you might want some coffee.
 No, no, I've got to go. No, no, wait a sec.
 We need you. Look, I've got a favour to ask.
 We've got someone in here who is turning over as quick as we thought.
 Could you sit in on the interview?
 Hey?
 Hey, what's with the face fungus?
 Undercover, undercover work, uh...
 ..gotta blend in with a heavy metal group
 who stole some furniture...
 Right. Bastards.
 So, anyway, how about it? Can you help us out with this?
 No, no, I can't, I really can't.
 They need me back on the job. Hang on a minute.
 Who's your guvnor? I'll ask him.
 Ohh, what the hell?
 Good lad. Grab your coffee.
 Right. Come on.
 OK, so far we've been going at him hard.
 Now, it might be time he found that...
 (chuckles) sympathetic ear he was looking for, know what I mean?
 So, I'm nasty, you're nice.
 OK? (Mutters)
 What? You're not so bad.
 No, no, I mean in the interview.
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Yeah, I was making a police joke.
 Yeah, right. It's Barry, by the way.
 Carter. Carter? Yeah. Lovely.
 Well, I tell you what - we'll let him
 sweat it out for a few minutes, alright?
 Finish your coffee.
 It's not bad, is it?
 (Makes strange agreeing noises)
 Bernard, come ON!
 Gaaaah! CORK POPS
 So, what happened?
 Alright, after you left, I remembered something about the dinner party.
 I did do Belly Savalas.
 (Makes strange mumbling noises)
 What's that? I can't hear you, Belly Savalas.
 POP!
 Who loves ya, baby?
 Ha-ha, what about that, eh?
 But I also realised that it wasn't Belly Savalas that upset them.
 It was something else...
 Something much, much worse.
 Oh, you didn't do 'CoBUMbo', did you?
 No...I didn't have any cigars.
 Alright, so you were knocked down?
 Even though I wasn't really badly hurt,
 I had to go to hospital for checks,
 and Peter insisted on coming with me.
 OK...
 And so I was still blanking him in the ambulance...
 How do you blank somebody in an ambulance?
 Come on, Fran, keep your eyes fixed on mine.
 Come on...Fran!
 (Determined) Keep your eyes on mine. Keep your eyes fixed on mine, Fran!
 CRACK! Aaaaagh!
 FRAN?! FRAN! Hurry, man! hurry!
 Did you ever get to tell him WHY you were blanking him?
 I certainly did.
 I spent some time explaining in VERY clear terms
 why he was a scumbag,
 and the fancy lady he was with was a slut.
 It was his sister.
 Yes.
 He was comforting her.
 She's lost her job.
 Ah. He won't be seeing you again?
 He says he wants to see other, less-mad, women.
 Alright, that's me. Now you, come on.
 I want to know how you became the Little Teapot.
 Alright, but I'm not going through it all again for Manny. Where is he?
 Remember - I'm nasty, you're nice, alright?
 Alright.
 Noggsy...
 ..you miss me?
 Yeah, I was just sitting here thinking,
 "When's Inspector Norris coming back?"
 Oi! Smart lip doesn't work with me, Noggsy.
 I don't react well to it.
 Now, you better start giving me something solid,
 or I'll feed you to the sharks.
 Ahem...ahem...
 ..you have beautiful eyes.
 You're going away, Noggsy, you understand me?
 This is the end of the line!
 Do you think it'd be really naughty if I phoned up the Hong Kong Kitchen
 and got us all some crispy duck?
 Sorry?!
 Listen, you better speak up, or else we'll be talking to your missus!
 Ho-ho-ho, how'd you like that, "family man"?
 Hey, when all this is blown over, let's go and see 'Les Miserables'.
 Ever been to the zoo? It's brilliant.
 What's...what's going on?
 Come over here...
 Listen, I don't know what the hell you're doing,
 but it seems to be working, he's getting shaky.
 I'll let you take over, offer him a deal.
 What sort of deal? I don't know, you call it.
 Uh, well, don't give away much. He's looking at two years, minimum.
 I'll be back in 10.
 Huh?!
 Ten MINUTES. Oh.
 Eh? Right!
 I'm locking the door, Noggsy.
 It doesn't open again until you give my partner something!
 DOOR LOCKS
 Yeah, that's definitely locked.
 I'm not a policeman! What?
 They think I'm a policeman, I'm not! I've just had too much coffee!
 What are you talking about?!
 What'll I do?
 I want Norris, get Norris back, I'll talk to him, I ain't talking to you!
 Aaaaaagggggh!
 POP!
 It's a boy!
 So come on, back to the story.
 I knew I'd done something heinous, so I thought,
 "To hell with it, I'll go and see Gerald and Sarah."
 DOORBELL RINGS
 W-what do you want?
 I just want to say I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry.
 Oh, well...
 Please accept my gifts.
 Maybe then we could clear the decks somehow,
 and you could actually tell me what it was that I actually...
 Did. PHONE RINGS
 Aaaagh!
 Bernard? Fran?
 Well, you did it.
 I don't know how you did it, but you did it.
 Well, you know, Barry, I'm just a cop...
 SQUASH!
 Just one copper trying to make a difference.
 I fell off me chair to some extent.
 You know, Barry, I've been doing this job for tw...
 ..twenty min-YEARS, since I was 15.
 And, uh, you know, it doesn't get any easier.
 So that's why I've made my decision to retire.
 That's right, Barry, I'm retiring, Noggsy was my last case.
 I've had 100% success rate, I'm only getting older and slower.
 It's time for this old warhorse to be put out to pasture.
 Well, that's a shame.
 I mean, I've been on the job nearly 20 years, too.
 And I can honestly say that you are the best bloody copper
 I have EVER worked with.
 It's been a privilege. OK, fair enough.
 Yeah, alright, lovely. Yeah.
 Oh, God...
 Anyway, where was I?
 You went to Gerald and Sarah's to ask them what you did.
 You mean you don't remember?
 Not as such, no.
 You don't remember standing up and asking for about the 100th time
 where the toilet was, drunk out of your skull?
 You stood up, you went to the toilet
 and you were gone an awful long time...
 Get him out. Get him out. Get him out!
 I will... Out, get him out, get him out now.
 Gerald, can I ask you a question?
 What?
 You know the thing, the thing that cleans these things,
 the thing cleaner.
 Why is that in your bathroom? (Mouths words)
 I'm not Coco Chanel or anything, but I think that's a bit weird.
 Um, Bernard, why don't I call you a cab?
 I don't want a cab, it's only half-one!
 Anyway, listen, listen. Why do you have a toaster in your bathroom?
 We haven't got a toaster in our bathroom.
 Well, you should put a lock on the door anyway, because I was in there,
 I was on the toilet and everything, little Jimmy comes in,
 he's drinking milk from the fridge and that's all wrong.
 It's unhygienic.
 And, and, what were you thinking?
 What was going through your brain when you thought,
 "Oh, yeah, I'll buy a WICKER toilet"?
 (Screams)
 I thought I did something bad.
 Alright, so I go to the toilet in your wicker chair, it's a faux pas.
 Faux pas?!
 Well, I thought I'd drunk all the booze or something.
 You did drink all the booze.
 Look at Jimmy.
 What? What, what?!
 He looks surprised.
 All children look surprised. Everything's new to them.
 Have I told you about the way that he...he, uh...he smokes?
 He does not smoke. Well, he's up to something.
 I've never said this before, because I was being nice,
 but your son has the cold...dead eyes
 of a killer.
 I mean, I come to your house, I bring a bottle of wine...
 You brought a policewoman.
 Policewoman, bottle of wine - the point is, I made an effort.
 And, and, you know, OK,
 I was slightly indiscrete, and I'm sorry!
 I am! But you...you blanked me, so...
 So what? Well, I think I deserve an apology.
 BOTH: Out.
 I came all the way across town to apologise.
 I don't even have the fare for a taxi back.
 I behaved with dignity and honour and grace.
 I'm a bit upset right now - you wouldn't understand
 what I'm talking about, 'cause I'm talking about dignity!
 Hence...
 So why were you embarrassed to tell me?
 Oh, well I fell, you know, it was so un-dashing.
 And of course going to the toilet through a chair -
 well, we've all been there.
 What happened to you?
 Oh, I've had some day.
 What happened? Well, it started off...
 What happened to you?
 SQUELCH!
 (High-pitched voice) That was a particularly bad one.
