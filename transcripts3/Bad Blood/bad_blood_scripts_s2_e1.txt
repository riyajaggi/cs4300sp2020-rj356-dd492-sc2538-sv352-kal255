 [insects and birds chirping] [eagle screaming] [lighter clicking] [Declan] Who are you? Have you ever really asked yourself that? Chances are no. - Because the world just tells you. - [cell phone beeps] You're a mother, you're a father, a bank teller, a dry cleaner, a degenerate. People have been telling me who I am my whole life. [tires squealing]

 For a long time, I was known as the right-hand man of Vito Rizzuto, the biggest mob boss Canada has ever known. We owned Montreal, until we had a parting of the ways. [church bell tolls] After Vito died, it was an all-out war in Montreal. All the gangs wanted to be king. [camera clicking] But this was my time now. And over the next five years, if the guys stepped out of line, I'd set 'em straight. ["It's a Long Way to the Top" by AC/DC plays] We had a long-standing truce, until Papa Lou got a little big in the britches...

 [Declan] Papa Lou! ...and thought he should run Montreal. - So, what, now you wanna talk? - All good things come to an end. The bikers went after a few of my shipments, so I decided a change in their management was in order. [bikers clamoring] And then we had the Irish. It was never just one thing. They were always a continuous pain in the ass. And to top it off, Toto Bianchi, the Toronto 'Ndrangheta boss got the crazy idea he could just move in on my city. So I talked some sense into him. ♪ It's a long way to the top ♪ ♪ If you wanna rock and roll... ♪ When all that was said and done, Montreal had a new set of bosses. I understand you all recently got promoted. Congratulations, Alex, Junior, Liam. Since this is your first day at school, I'm gonna tell you how things work. When I ring the bell, you show up for class. If you're late, you better have a note from your mother. From now on, all of you are now gonna buy your drugs... from me and only me. As for your other businesses, I couldn't care less. We good? [Declan] They were good. With everyone now in line, I easily locked down the port. Nothing could move in or out without my okay. When your city is an island, you need access to the port to be a serious player. And now I was gonna be the only player. The most important thing I learned from all my years in this business is that everyone, I don't care if it's the mob, the cartels, the Yakuza, goddamn ISIS, everyone is brought down by someone on the inside. So I work alone. And that's what I'm after. Not money, not power. Independence. Which is why I ended up in Mexico. Declan! Good to see you, my friend! Manuel. This is Jorge. [Declan] Jorge Ramirez, one of the most powerful and feared cartel bosses in the world. [Manuel] This is Declan. It's a long way from Canada, amigo. Well, you picked such a convenient location. [laughing] Manuel says you've been asking to meet with me every week for the last year. So now we meet. What is it you want? I wanna buy directly from you. I only sell directly to a few people. People I know that can handle it. I own the ports in Montreal, as you know. It's the gateway to the entire Northeast. Nothing comes in or goes out without my approval, so I can handle it. That would put you in a very high position. You would control the market up there. But why do you need the added aggravation? You want more money? No. - What else is there? - Do you answer to anyone? No. That is what I want. Manuel... is my cousin. Did you know that? - [Declan] I did. - Of course you did! Manuelito likes to tell everyone that he's my cousin! [in Spanish] You're making me look like an idiot... It's okay! It's okay, Manuelito. I understand. [in Spanish] When you're not important, you have to tell people that you know someone important. [in English] Of course, we did our research on you. I don't meet with just anyone. No, I wouldn't think you do. And you are as he says, profesional, focused. You had all that whole mess with the Mafia to deal with, and now you are the strongest in your city. Myself, I didn't like dealing with the Italians. They pay on time, but they look down on us. Anyway, while we were looking into you, we discovered that we were short payments on some of the shipments that you bought through Manuel. [Jorge] Can you explain that? - No. - Are you sure? I don't short anyone, ever. No, you don't. It was Manuel that was stealing from them, which means he was also stealing from you. [in Spanish] What's going on, cousin? I already told you it was that bastard! You can't believe that I was stealing... [gunshot echoing] [Jorge] We will do business with you. One hundred kilos to start. That's five million US. Most don't have the cash to pay for such a large shipment up front, so you'll have seven days to come up with my money. Not a problem. And if you can handle more, then we will increase from month to month. - Sound good? - Good. Bueno. But if anything goes wrong... You've been in this business a long time, amigo. You know what will happen to you. Manuel, he was family, and you don't make family suffer. You're not family. [Declan] In the world of crime, crooks are crooks, thieves are thieves, liars are liars, and the only person who's not gonna stab you in the back... is you. Let's not beat around the bush anymore. Who am I? I'm a gangster. [theme music playing] Detective Nellie Bullock? I'm sorry I'm late. Couldn't find the place. [sniffles] Ken Tucker. Just take video. Anyone coming in or out of that banquet hall. [Ken] Who's the mark? The 'Ndrangheta bosses. The what? What department you work in? Uh, I'm in fraud. Fraud. Well, high-level fraud is big stuff. You ever work in the field? No, but I've been trying to get transferred over to organized crime for about a year. I mean, I was psyched when I got the call this morning. I know you don't wanna be tutoring a rookie or anything like that, - but I really wanna learn... - Recess is over, Ken. - Yep. - They're here. [camera clicking] [man groaning, sniffling] [man 1] You all right? My allergies are killing me. We'll get you something on the way home. [Ken] So, who we got here? [Nellie] Lorenzo Cosoleto, 'Ndrangheta capo, and his son, Ignazio. [camera clicking] [man 2] Okay, let's go, let's go! [Nellie] And this is Lorenzo's brother, the real boss, Domenic, and his pretty boy, Luca. Look at that face. He's already starting to say "papa." [Enzo] You were a cute baby, but this kid is something else! Always first to the buffet! Enzo, what's wrong? You look like one of them fish, you know, the kind that blow up. - Yeah, a puffer fish! - That's it. - He doesn't look like a puffer fish. - Allergies. Since when you got allergies? - Since lately. - Don't start. You don't got no allergies. It's a great comfort to me that my brother's become a doctor in the last 24 hours! If you want, I can check your prostate, too. You're disgusting! Enzo, you might be lactose intolerant. Dairy's really bad for you. I cut out all dairy. I feel great. - What do you put in your cereal then? - Almond milk. - Almond milk? - Enough! Dom, what's happening? What are we doing here? The families back home told me to work with 'em. That's all I know. Would you stop saying "back home"? You've been here for 50 years. This is home! I know I was born in Calabria, I know our father and mother were born in Calabria. Calabria's home! He's the only one born in Italy, he likes to hold it over us. - So give it to him. - It's like the vampires. Vampires? Yeah. The original vampires are the real vampires. They got pure blood. The ones that have been turned, you see, the people that get bit and turn into vampires, they're lower on the totem pole. They don't have original blood. So now I'm... What, I'm a vampire? No, Pop, that's not what I meant. - What I meant is you're the OG vampire. - [Enzo] Would you shut up already? - Domenic, you're not telling us anything. - I'm telling you everything I know. - They're here to help expand business. - My business or their business? Enzo, please. Let's take a beat. They're gonna get here soon. Why don't we eat a bit before we look like a bunch of cows in front of them? Okay? Thanks for dressing up for the occasion. That's nice of you. - You're welcome! - This is a $135 sweater. I got this in Milan! - It's the only thing I own. - [Domenic] Forget it. Let's just eat. I have a CI who told me about the meeting. Every month, the families gather to report on their businesses, - settle disputes, make... - Oh, look! [camera clicking] - [camera clicking] - [Ken] Who is that? I have no idea. - [Enzo] So the capos don't trust us? - [Domenic] Of course they do. So why send someone? I don't know, Enz. Maybe the organization is changing. Yeah. You're the one taking orders now. [Luca] Hmm. They're here. [Domenic] Oh, look who's early! Benvenuto, Christian. Ciao, Domenic. - Teresa, benvenuto. - Grazie. I'm Domenic. I welcome you with the same respect I would your father. You know, he was very kind to my mother after my father passed. I'm never gonna forget that. Our father loved your father very much. He still remembers you as the smartest little boy in the village. Let me introduce you to everyone. You know. Then you guys can have something to eat. Nonna made her famous pasta. Actually, we already ate, but thank you. - I'm Enzo. - Enzo. [Bullock] No one sits in on the meetings. No one. It's only for the bosses. Well, I guess they must be bosses, too. No. I've been on the 'Ndrangheta for three years. I know who's who in Ontario. [Nellie] Way too young. They're outsiders. It was a difficult loss for everyone when Toto was murdered. But, Domenic, you've done a wonderful job running yours - and his territory since then. - Thank you. Let me assure you, we are not here to take anything away. Quite the opposite. We are here to help us all grow. Our organization has grown exponentially over the last ten years. We now control 80% of the European cocaine and heroin market. - Oh! - Salute! [Christian] But we see even greater things ahead for all of us. And that is why our father sent Teresa and I here. We have a simple three-part plan to get your drug business back on track to where it should be. Expand territory, diversify product, increase local profits. [Teresa] Times have changed. Business has changed. We live in the world of Amazon, Apple. To thrive, you must be the only option to consumers, suppliers, and everyone in-between. You either own it all, or you own nothing. - Exactly what I've been saying. - Luca! This time next year, we will be moving ten times as much product. [Enzo] Ten times? We already supply most of Ontario with what we're moving. What are we gonna do with all that? Expand. To Montreal. [chuckling] Okay. - What's the problem? - Declan. - [Christian] The one who killed Toto. - And Vito. Look, the papers said it was, uh, natural causes. Declan, he wiped everybody out. He runs things now, so everybody buys only from Declan, all right? He's also got a lock on the port, so don't even think about using that. You know, I'm gonna be honest with you guys. You wanna take a piss in Montreal, you gotta go through him first. [both chuckling softly] Well, perhaps he'll be amenable to a partnership. No, he doesn't do that. He doesn't make partnerships. He's not... He's not interested in keeping the peace. [Enzo] It's not worth it. We already went to war for years with him and Vito. You know, we almost lost everything. Let him have it. Thank you for your honesty. But our father tasked us with a job, and we do not ever let him down. We trust that you will feel the same way. Great things are coming to our family, gentlemen, and my brother and I are very excited. [tense music playing] [door buzzing] [door buzzing] [exhales sharply, chuckles] Hey, hey. [Reggie] Hey. [Declan] How you doing? Hey. [coughs] Thanks for picking me up. You bet. [clears throat] I got the address for the rooming house I'm staying at. Oh, you're not staying there. I took care of that. You are staying with me. Really? [chuckles] Of course. You're my nephew. You're staying with me. Reggie, I've got a great spot in the country. Lots of food, new clothes. I'm gonna drop you off, then I got a meeting I gotta get to, okay? Yeah, all right. Hey! I got something for you. Um, because of everything you did for me, I wanted to give this to you when I got out. This helped me a lot in there. Wow. [Declan] Look at me and your mom. Babies. You hold onto that. For us. Let's go. [car door opens] Stop looking. That's done with. Let's go home. Yeah. [birds chirping] [Nats] Here goes a big bite! [imitating airplane whooshing] Aaah... Oooh! [laughs] Almost, Bubba! Almost! - So, uh... - There you go! So, what are they like? Like no one I ever met before. Okay, she shows up to this meeting wearing clothes from a fashion show. I mean, her coat, it's gotta be worth two grand or more, I'll bet. Wow. So what does all this mean for you? I don't know. I mean, things are good right now. It's quiet and steady. Expansion just means problems, you know? Yeah. - How did Zio Dom feel? - [Nats inhales sharply] You know him, he's old school. He won't break the chain of command. If that's what the families back home wants, then that's what he's gonna do. - Want some more? - [phone chimes] Adamo, you can't just eat cookies all day, bro! Trust me, you're a boy after my own heart, but still, you gotta... you can't just eat the cookies. You're gonna end up looking like your old man. [chuckles] You know what, I forgot I made a stupid appointment - for my nails. It's been weeks. - Okay. Um, do you gotta go back to work? Nah, Papa is there. I'm just gonna take this guy to the park. You wanna go to the park, big man? [Valentina] Hmm, okay. I'll be back soon. - Okay, take care. - Love you. Come on, one bite. One bite. You have that last cookie? Can I have it? [tense music playing] I am not at your beck and call! Actually, you are. I told you about the meeting. What else do you want? I wanna know about the newcomers. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I can keep you here all night, and you can try and explain that to Nats, or you can tell me what you know and be on your merry way. They're cousins from Calabria. Names? Teresa and Christian Langana. - Why were they at the meeting? - I don't know. - You sure? - That's all he told me. How was Nats' mood after the meeting? Uh, fine. Concerned, distracted? Same as always! I don't know. Uh, if you hadn't asked, I wouldn't have thought to mention. How's that? It's probably just a family visit. They didn't strike me as the types who come to Hamilton, Ontario for a vacation. What do you want? That's all I know, all right? They don't exactly take minutes at these things, so... Can I go? Is that all right? Don't forget to get a manicure. It's the details that matter, Val. - [Nellie] It's already paid for. - [scoffs] - How'd you get her? - Lucky break. I've been tailing the whole family and caught her at a motel sleeping with another dad from her son's preschool. Filmed it through a window. And Nats is the only capo I've ever heard of who actually talks to his wife about his business. Seems like a sweet guy, but he can't keep his mouth shut! So why did she cheat on him? [Nellie] Postpartum, boredom, living in the suburbs, longing for her carefree days. Pick one. All that matters is the net result. [Declan] My shipment from the cartel was on its way, and everything else I needed was locked down: My supply, the port, the buyers. But when you're moving hundreds of keys, you need to diversify your points of entry. Back in the day, I used to run with this cigarette smuggler, Bobby Sunwind. His reserve straddles the Canadian/US border, so we could move anything across without customs even getting a whiff. But he was doing time for a bar fight gone wrong, so I went to talk to his sister, Rose, who is now running their operations. - Hey, Twix. - [Twix] Hey. - Rose. - Hey. Been awhile. Been too long. Way, way too long. You mind if we take a walk? - Sure. - I, uh... saw Bobby a couple of weeks ago. I mean, under the circumstances, he's doing all right. Yeah, he told me. He said you'd also be by with an offer. I'm wondering if you're up for moving something other than cigarettes? We get asked that a lot. I always say no. You haven't been asked by me. That's why I'm listening. All right. Six percent on product or four percent in cash on every load. We're gonna be dealing with heavy weights, so those are gonna be big numbers for you. Well, I'm not interested in dealing, so that's not a carrot. I want eight percent cash. It's a little high for a first-timer. You wouldn't be coming to me if I was a first-timer. I've been running contraband for over a decade. I know you have. But cocaine, smoke, it's different. Different game, different risks. Declan, I know that no one knows the game better than you. But if I'm gonna ask my people to do this, it's gotta be worth the risk. They will walk off a cliff for me, but that is because they know that I'm looking out for them. That's good to hear, but the offer stays the same. I'll think about it, but don't get your hopes up. All right. [Declan] Take it easy, Twix. [Domenic] Like I said, those are Declan's guys. I doubt you'll get much out of them. They'll meet you at two o'clock tomorrow. Yes, that's good. Good. You call if you need anything. - Thank you, Domenic. - Okay. The meeting at the port is set. Okay. [Christian sighs] You should stop cutting your hair. Grow it out like, uh... like when were at school in Geneva. Teresa, I was eight! I know. But it looked so good. You know, I always thought you looked like Papa with your longer hair. Yeah? I don't know. I'll see. [sighing] So, what do you think of Domenic? He's a boss. Now he has to take orders. We have to be a little understanding of that. But in the end, he will serve the greater good. The others aren't an issue. Soft in the middle. I know Papa said to lead them by the hand, but, Teresa, I think this is just a waste of time. No, I think he's right. They have been tending to their... own little garden for so long, we can't just come in like a bulldozer. [Christian sighs] You have much more patience than I do. Yeah, well, not always. Hmm. They are still our blood, Christian. But if they can't follow through with what we need... they will be easy enough to replace. [distant rock music playing] ["Picturing Love" by July Talk plays on stereo] ♪ Picturing love, picturing love ♪ ♪ I'm tired of picturing love ♪ ♪ When I wear, wear my hair... ♪ Hey! ♪ It's a man's world fantasy ♪ ♪ I undress ♪ - [music stops] - Was that too loud? Ya think?! - [chuckles] - Reggie, I keep it on the down-low! - Low. - Yeah. Sorry. Would you look at this spread, huh? Yeah, I went a little overboard, maybe. You really learned to cook like this? Yeah, dude, I told you! I worked the line inside. I did it three times a day, every day, for eight years. I worked every station. It's like a mindset. It's like a habit. It's a way of life. The stupid thing is that when I was close to getting out, I was thinking, "I'm never gonna do this ever again." But it's like cooking is the one thing I'm good at, the one thing I don't screw up. It's awesome! It keeps me out of my head. [Declan sighs] I been holding onto that for you. Since I'm the next of kin, they sent it to me. - What is it? - It's a settlement from the government. Victim compensation. There was a suit brought against that foster care home you grew up in, for the abuse of all those kids who were living there. Reggie... you didn't tell me about any of that. Why? Just happened a long time ago. [sniffs] You sign that, they'll send you a check straightaway. It absolves the government and anyone else of wrongdoing. $14,373. Hey! [Declan] Fifteen K. That's free money that you just crumpled up. And I... I don't wanna take that from you. Free? They took you, a baby boy, and left you with a monster, then shut the door behind them. You don't ever forget about that. You hear me? I'm your family. I'll take care of you. [seagulls squawking] [ship horn blaring] [Christian] Look, we have done this all over the world. A good import team is essential. You just name your price, we'll make it happen. We can't negotiate with you. - Hold on, that's a hell of... - Shut up, Frank! [Christian] Frank is correct. This is a win-win for everyone. We believe that happy employees do their best work. We just can't accommodate you at this moment. We understand that, uh, you don't know us, and that it takes time to establish a relationship, but... You're vouched for. That's not the problem. But we shouldn't even be talking to you. We're just the wrong guys to ask. You understand? So be it. [Teresa] Siro, let's go. Well, that went exactly as expected. We can't get messed up with these guys. Domenic... we need to talk to Declan, face to face. That's not gonna be easy. You are resourceful. Find the path of least resistance. - [Domenic] I'll arrange it. - [Teresa] Good. Son of a... Hey, put a little more salt in the sauce, okay? [indistinct chatter in French] [heavy metal playing on stereo] [tattoo gun buzzing] - [cell phone beeping] - Hold on. Hey, Alex. What is it? Domenic wants to set a meet with Declan. New blood from Italy wants to talk. They obviously don't know Declan. I have to catalog every picture and video. This is gonna take a long time. Not compared to sifting through bank statements, it's a ride on a roller coaster. [cell phone ringing] - Detective Bullock. - Hey, it's Gabriel. Hey. What's up? Domenic Cosoleto just called Alex to arrange a meet with Declan. New family here from Italy wants to meet him. When? I don't know. Soon. And I don't know what for. That's good. Keep me posted. Thanks for the tip. Be careful. - [siren wailing] - [car honking] [trip hop playing on stereo] Your driver will bring it onto the American side of the reserve. Cops can't cross our boundaries. You can unload in peace. My guys will come and pick it up by boat. Sounds too good to be true. Oh, it's good. And true. All right. Six percent. Cash. That's not what I asked for. No, but it's what you're gonna take. Really? Rose, this is a new game for you. Now, you're working with the same people, but they're gonna see you differently. You gotta be a different kind of boss. It's a fair bump from my first offer to you. Twix and your underlings are gonna be impressed. So you're giving me more out of charity? I'm buying stability. It's a fair trade. You think I'm gonna be that easy? To the contrary. I think you're gonna be a pain in the ass. [rock clattering] Hey, Reg, I was thinking that if you're bored at the cottage, you know, I got a pad in town. You could bring a girl or whatever. It's nice. It's a nice spot. You know, if you wanna live alone, get some privacy. If you want me to go, I can go. That's cool. No. I don't want you to go. You got, like, a lone-wolf thing going on, so if you want me to go... I want you to stay. Yeah, I mean, if I got a choice, I would say stay with you because I don't actually like being alone much, but... You know who else didn't wanna be alone? Your mom. Yeah? Your beautiful mom. I had to take her everywhere. - Everywhere. She was my little shadow. - Yeah? All right, stay put. So, what's this about? Got a call from Domenic Cosoleto. He's got relatives in town who wanna meet with you. My guy at the port said they had a talk with a man and a woman. I also asked around. Yeah? And it seems there are new bosses in town. I was happy to tell him to shove it up his ass, but he's called me three times already. - Obviously, they're forcing his hand. - Who are they? I don't know. But the way Domenic is acting, it feels big time. [Alex] So, what do you wanna do? Set the meet. [thudding and groaning] Look, I promise, okay? I'll have the rest for you next week. Come on, you guys! You know me! When have I not paid? - Is this guy serious? - It seems so. Look, I don't wanna be working right now, okay? This is the third night in a row I haven't been home to put my son to bed. - So let's just figure this out, okay? - You heard that? Nats is losing precious family hours because of you. Hey, I myself have many other things I'd rather be doing right now. Shit! - [Luca] Aw, man. - [Nats] What? - I'm missing the game! - What time's the game? No, no, no! Don't! Tomorrow! - Tomorrow, okay? I promise. - That's predictable. I mean, today, you got nothing, tomorrow, you got everything, right, so... Yeah, five more minutes, and this guy can get me a night with Kylie Jenner. James, if you could do that, I'll cover your debt. [Domenic] Oh! What's all the racket? - He's gonna pay! - Where you gonna get it? We're not chasing you down for another excuse. My brother-in-law, okay? He's a doctor. He's got money. Shhh. All right, listen to me. Tomorrow at five, you're gonna be here with everything paid in full, right? - Absolutely. Thank you, Domenic! - Beautiful. Get out of here. - [groans] - Hey! [grunting] Luca! - [Domenic] Stop! - [Nats] Hey, hey, hey! - You piece of shit! - Come here! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Relax! Relax! [Domenic] Luca, what are you doing? You can't go off on a guy like that. You help him to his car, all right? Then you're gonna come back here, you're gonna clean up this mess. [Luca] It's all over my shirt. Now I gotta go home... Eighty dollars worth of sauce! It's okay, we can still use it. It's just a couple hairs. [both laughing] Hey, Domenic, speaking of hair. We haven't talked about the ice queens yet. - What's to talk about? - What's to talk about? We got a boss to answer to. Ah, they're Vincenzo's kids. He gave them the keys. You're just gonna say please and thank you to those peacocks? Oh, stop. I don't take orders. You know, but right now, we gotta go... we gotta go along with it. It's... It's... They kind of scare me, Domenic. Yeah, it's in their eyes. They're not like us. Look, I don't want you to worry about it, all right? Right now, we just gotta be smart, right? 'Cause everything we say, everything we do, - is reported back. Am I right? - Yeah. But you're right. You know, they're not like us. [chuckles] [clears throat] You're good? - Yeah, I'm good. Okay. - All right. Come on, I'll give you a ride home. [Enzo sighs] [crickets chirping] [tense music playing] [car door shuts] [Teresa] Middle of nowhere. It's somewhere for someone. Thank you for agreeing to meet with us. I sense a... reticence, which, in our business, is understandable, but... rest assured, we are on your side. And how is that? Well, Vito, he was a problem for our family for many years. We have that in common. We have absolutely nothing in common. Hmm. [lighter clicks open] [Teresa] Mmm. There's something about being in nature that makes me want to smoke a cigarette. I wonder what that is? What do you want? - We met with your friends at the port. - I heard. They're very loyal, which is good. Loyalty is a proof of confidence. That wasn't an answer. I said, "What do you want?" The business in Canada has plateaued. The old men are content to stay as they are, which has been good for you, but bad for the organization. So the even older men in Italy sent you two. [chuckles] You're funny. [Teresa] We've done our due diligence. You are good at what you do. So we want you to be our partner in Montreal. Hmm. You will be handling volume you could only dream of. We will arrange the shipment. You will do what you do on the ground to receive and distribute. We understand the benefit of having someone who the locals know and trust. Hmm... We don't want to rock the boat. We want to offer you a yacht. [chuckles] You want me... to work for you? You say it like we are offering you a job at McDonald's. You will be pocketing no less than 20 million cash the first year. Double that the next. Whatever you need is yours. You choose your people. You call the shots. Running things all alone comes with problems you can't even imagine. - [clicks tongue] - [Teresa] And for what? That was only our opening bid. We came here to negotiate. Talk to us. As long as I'm above ground, I don't work for anyone. Ever. [suspenseful music playing] [cell phone beeps] [Declan] Vito operated from 30,000 feet in the air. He prided himself in never dealing directly with the suppliers of the product. But it was those middle men and partners who ultimately turned on him. By dealing directly with the cartel, I wouldn't suffer the same fate. With my shipment on the way, I'd soon be holding all the cards. They need to see you guys down in payroll. Some confusion about your overtime this week. I'll watch your terminals, though. [door shuts] [beeping] [beeping] [beeping] [gate buzzing] [reversing beep] [reversing beep] Declan? All good? [Declan] Yeah. I'm about to leave now. Meet my driver. He's standing by. Standing by? He just left. The ship arrived early. I was actually surprised how fast your driver got here. - What are you talking about? - The load. They just picked it up already. Well, he didn't pick up shit! I haven't given him the PIN yet! He had the PIN number. Where's my load? He had the PIN number, uh... Where is my load? [cell phone vibrating] [cell phone beeps] [Teresa] I told you there are all kinds of problems you could never even imagine... when doing this all by yourself. Our offer is still on the table for... another 24 hours. We will hold onto your shipment until then, but the terms will change for each hour you wait. Don't think too hard on it, Declan. [cell phone clatters] [Declan] Next time on Bad Blood. My employer sent me to remind you that our payment deadline is still the same date. We are now in possession of Declan's entire shipment. What do you think happens to mob wives who cheat on their husband and rat on them to the cops? If I choose to tell Nats, they kill you. [Domenic] They just made your 100 keys disappear. So if we go to war, Declan, this ain't Vito you're dealing with. These people, they don't... they don't got soft spots. They don't lose. Neither do I.
