I'm gonna reenlist. What? W-what I mean is, I'd like to reenlist. Jeremy... My contract's up in a few months... Just when I'm starting to get more responsibility. I can do more. It's like I finally know my job. Have you been talking to your father? No. He has no idea about this. Look, I know I may have signed up for the wrong reasons... But I'm older now, and I've learned a lot. What about college? I still want to go to college. When? You're already falling behind. Mom, I have plenty of time for college. You'll redeploy. You'll go to afghanistan. You know that. I know. But, mom, I won't do this if you don't want me to. That's why I came here. I know what I've put you through these last few years... And there is so much that I wish that I could undo. But you always stood by me. And I don't want to hurt you again. So if this is gonna be too much, You say so... And I won't do it. What are you doing, dog? Okay, okay. I get it. And I appreciate the "man's best friend" bit. But I'm fine. Jeez. Jeremy said it was up to you? He said he didn't want to hurt menymore. What did you tell him? Everything in me wanted to shout" no, don't do it." But for some reason, I didn't. I just told him I-I couldn't give him an answer right away. It's really remarkable, denise, what he did. It's very loving. I don't want him to reenlist, claudia joy. We almost lost him once. And the idea that he'd do this again... I just couldn't bear it if... I know. But how can I stand in his way? But if I say yes and he doesn't come back... I would never forgive myself, never. Hey. I figured out why the lightbulb keeps burning out in this lamp. What I did was... Chase... We both know that we need to talk, So let's talk, okay? Okay. I asked you for a yes or a no... And you said it's complicated. Yes or no isn't complicated to me. So why don't you talk? I've got a proposal. We meet each other halfway. How do you halfway leave delta? Hear me out. I will leave delta, just n right away. So you're not leaving? Are you gonna listen to me? I'talking about a compromise. I stay in delta four more years. That's your compromise? Chase, four years is a long time. This family needs you now. And what's gonna be different in four years? I make it to sergeant major, Help train the next group of operators, Then I quit... done deal. I've worked my whole life to get to this point, pamela. Don't make me choose. Four years? And that'd be it. I'm out of delta... No questions asked. Chase, I understand that you have to go out on missio. I understand that you get called away At a moment's notice. But... Your heart is there, not here. From now on, it wot be. You go to their games, Their dance recitals, parent/teacher conferences, Whenever you possibly can. You help with their science projects, Their book reports whenever you can. I will do all that, I swear. This family has to be the priority, chase. It has to be for this to work. So are you saying yes? I'm not saying anything. I'm... Still thinking about it. What's there to think abt? Do you still love me? That is not what this is about. It is what it's about, Because I ve you. Mm. Good morning. Mm. Morning. You sleep good? Yeah. You? So you had sex? Yeah. I thought you were just gonna talk. Yeah, we talked, and then we had sex. Okay. I know. I'm so tough, right? He says, "baby, I love you. Let's compromise." And all my lines in the sand, all my big talk, It's right out the window. Next thing I know, I'm all over him like some teenager. So how was it? Amazing... Clothes ripping, nothing else matters... That kind of moment. Hey. You sure you're okay with me talking about this? I really don't have to... I'm fine. I'm fine. Really. So you had great sex with your husband. That happens. Yeah... Just not usually when you're talking About getting a divorce. Everything was so clear before he came home. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. Any ideas? That's unfair. You're my best friend in the whole world, pamela. The idea of us being neighbors again, The kids underfoot every day driving us crazy... What do you expect me to say? You have to do what's right for you, What makes you happy. Yeah... If I even kn what that was anymore. It was all black and white. Now everything's gray. I hate gray. "claudia joy holden." Yes. Nigel miller, dean of admissions. Hello. This way. Thank you for coming by. Of course. It's not every day we have an applicant Who dropped out of harvard 20 years ago. Uh, no, sir. I suppose not. You say you withdrew in your third year For... "personal reasons." Can you elaborate? Ahem. Sure. It was a, um... It was a fatal car accident involving a pedestrian. I was the driver, and, uh, It was unavoidable. No charges were filed. And I needed to take some time. I see. But you never returned to law school. I was planning to. My life took a different turn. I met my husband, and he was assigned overseas. And the, uh, occasion to resume my studies Never presented itself. Until now. Yes. With my daughter about to graduate high school, I finally have the opportunity. Better late than never? Not exactly. That was a rhetorical question, ms. Holden. Nevertheless, carolina law has a limited number of spaces For transfer applicants. We don't want to be the cure-all for empty nest syndrome. Of course not. Do you actually intend to sit for the bar in south carolina? That would depend how long my husband remains posted here. I do intend to sit for the bar somewhere. I've, uh, I've already demonstrated my commitment To advocacy within the military system. I've initiated change in a variety of areas. Uh... Educational counseling, Um, domestic violence, Adult education for spouses... Yes, I noticed all that on your application. Impressive. Thank you. I'm simply wondering, with your current level of involvement, Why you need a law degree. Dean miller, my husband won't be in the military forever, And a degree would allow me to practice in the civilian world. While we're both still in the public sector, I'd like the knowledge to be able to do the best job I can For military families, and I am determined to be The best prepared student in my class. And I believe that my life experience and perspective Would be a significant asset here at carolina. Mm-hmm. Well, thank you for coming by. We'll be in touch. Thank you for your time. Mm. ♪ Any time you ♪ ♪ say it with heart ♪ ♪ any time ♪ ♪ you're falling apart ♪ ♪ when you're washing the sheets ♪ ♪ of any stranger you meet ♪ ♪ when there's somebody ♪ ♪ waving good-bye ♪ ♪ you're coming home ♪ ♪ to me, just remember ♪ ♪ you're coming home ♪ ♪ to me ♪ Hey, babe.
