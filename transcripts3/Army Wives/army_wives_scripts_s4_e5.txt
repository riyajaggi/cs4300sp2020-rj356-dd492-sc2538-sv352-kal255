Wait, mom. Ah. Mm-hmm. What are you all up to? nothing. Nothing, huh? Nope. No surprises. Well, since you're doing nothing, Why don't you go clean the living room? It looks like a tornado went through there. Yeah. Let's go. All right. And lucky needs his walk. What? I don't know anything. Did you get your errands done? Uh-huh. Then I, uh, went to see amanda. I just felt like I needed a visit... Just the two of us. It was nice. Yeah? Yeah. You all right? Mm-hmm. Listen, did you remember To keep your schedule clear after brunch tomorrow? Yes. Do you finally want to tell me why? Yes. Come here. Because emmalin and I are kidnapping you To kiawah island for the rest of the day. Oh, michael, I... Nope. Unh-unh.

Aunt edie? And my husband, uh, was the chief mechanic at macdill. That... that's an air force base. And he worked on f-4 phantoms and then f-16s. Building, attention! As you were. Michael! Oh! Aunt edie. Hi. Oh, and here I was... I was just talking his ear off. What are you doing here? Well, the last time we spoke, You said that I could come visit anytime. That's true. And I looked at my schedule, and this weekend was free... you didn't get my e-mail. I have several different accounts. It probably just fell through the cracks. Oh, dear. I should've called. No. Is this a bad time? It pno, not at all. Femy car is right out front. We'll call claudia joy and we'll let her know we're on our way. It's so wonderful to see you, michael. Ooh!

Which makes her your great-aunt. She was married to uncle joe, grandpa holden's brother. Okay. Uncle joe died a few months ago. Your father went to florida for his funeral, remember? Mm-hmm. Your dad's always been really good to them. He helped her settle the estate. But why's she coming now? I mean, tomorrow's mother's day. Don't you think that's sort of strange? Well, we're the only family she has left. I guess she's pretty lonely without her husband. Hmm. She probably didn't even realize it was a holiday weekend. Doesn't she have kids? She had one... bobby. He was killed in vietnam. Right. Yeah, that's really sad. So I guess this means no kiawah island tomorrow. Afraid not. We had an awesome day planned. We were both gonna get massages, we had dinner reservations... I know. I'm sorry, honey. I'm disappointed, too. But for now, let's just make the best of it, okay? Mm. We're home! Come in. Ah!

Well, I suppose joan and I are living up to the army tradition. Sent her a little something. Just hope it gets there on time. Fingers crossed. Let me show you where this podium goes. Oh, sure. Ma'am, it's confirmed. Our main communication lines are down, Satellite reception is also compromised. I figured. I've been trying to get an outside line to call home. It's dead.

That something as simple as this Can bring modern technology to a halt. Okay. Keep me posted. Yes, ma'am. I don't know about you, emmalin, but I am exhausted. Aunt edie, you wore me out. Oh, lightweights. Hi. Did you have fun? It was great. Excuse me. General holden. Why don't we sit in here? You know, I still think we could've caught That last ferry to fort sumter.

Well, I'll miss my tour guide, But you're leaving me in very good hands. I know I am. I have to make a few calls. Go. So I guess that leaves just us girls tomorrow. Mm-hmm. Looks like it. Okay, I'll freshen up and then we can talk about our plans. All right. Hmm. Oh, great. Emmalin. No, mom. It was supposed to be you, me and dad. Now the whole weekend's ruined. Happy mother's day! All right, breakfast. Eggs made to order, Buttered toast... yeah! O.J., no pulp. Mmm. And we made these for you, too. Lucky, too. Aw! I love them! Thank you so much! All right, boys, operation's going according to plan. Go get dressed, let your mom eat, We rendezvous in the kitchen for pancakes. I'll make 'em before I leave. I think it's really sweet That you're going to see that kid play today. But I still think mother's day Is a pretty dumb time for a baseball tournament. Babe, we've been over this. I can do both. It's no problem. Does every recruiter go out of his way like this? Yeah, and then some. Besides, tommy's a foster kid. I know what it'sike to have a familiar face in the crowd. Yeah, okay. Okay. Thank you for all this. Steaks on the grill tonight? Maybe. Trevor, you cook three things... Eggs, pancakes and steaks. You're forgetting mac and cheese, Ordering pizza and a good drive-through. Those don't count. Well, we got another surprise for you, But you're gonna have to wait till I get back from the game. What if I don't want to wait for it? What if I want it right now? Mm, I don't think we're talking about the same surprise. I know we're not. Come on. Remember last mother's day? Babe... The kids. You're killing me. That's the plan. No, I gotta go. Mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh. Eat your eggs. All right. Pancakes, let's do it! Okay, keep your eyes closed, mom. They are closed. Well, no peeking. I'm not peeking. Can I open them yet? Not yet. Almost. Okay, now!

A mom's coupon book! Mm-hmm. "good for one hug." "good for one kiss." "for one taking out the garbage." And one for washing dishes. I love this! It was dad's idea. Your father called? It was when we were all talking a couple days ago. Oh. He told us to be really good on mother's day. I bet. He has a coupon for you, too. Really? He told me what to write. "good for one 'fill in the blank.'" I don't get it. Well, I think I'm gonna have to use one of these right now. Let's see. Hmm. How about this one- "good for one hug"? Come here. Pay up. Oh, thank you so much. Hmm. Oh. Well, hey there. Hello. Frank... I thought my new motorcycle took the place of flowers This year. Well, what's a mother's day without flowers? You're spoiling me. Mmm. Hey, um... About our ride today... Yeah, what's going on? Well, the colonel running jeremy's field exercise Got blown off course during his jump. Landed in a tree, got banged up pretty bad. Don't tell me... Yeah. They've asked me to assume command. Okay. All right. Well, we'll do our ride next weekend. All right. Roger that. Okay. Good morning. Happy mother's day. I'm so glad So many of you could join us. Mother's day is always a special day. And I think it's even more special For those of us who have loved ones serving overseas. Being a parent or a wife Or a husband of a deployed soldier Is hard to describe For someone not in the army family... The enormous pride we feel, The fear, the worry. It can get overwhelming at times, Which is why we rely on each other To share the good times and the tough times Until our soldiers return home. Will the following families please stand? The tatoras... The garcias... The culls... And the nishiyama family. I'm happy to announce That the f.R.G. Has a very special gift For these four families. Believe me, I wish I could give all of you in this room The same gift today. Happy mother's day. ♪ These soldiers are on r&r; from iraq and afghanistan. The 23rd airborne division arranged to get them here In time for our mother's day celebration. Aunt edie? I'm sorry. Are you all right? I'm sorry. Edie? What's the matter? You miss your husband. Well, of course I do. But this is about bobby. Your son. Watching those soldiers coming back, Walking in the way that they did... That's what I want. They never found him. Missing in action. Mm. It was night, And somebody saw bobby Go to a wounded soldier, And he never came back. I'm so sorry. I kept waiting for news and I hoped and I prayed. I know he's not coming back. Oh... But I still dream about it. I st... I still look for him in a crowd. It would be what it was like for those families today. He would come walking up the road to greet me, And he'd be smiling. And he would still be an 18-year-old boy. Amanda was 18 when she was taken from us. No mother should outlive her children. It's just not right. No, it's not. I want my daughter back... Every day. You understand Why this time of year is so difficult for me. Joe knew it. He'd always take me away on trips. And this is the first year he's not here to do that. That's why you came. I miss my son. Don't beat yourself up, claudia joy. There's no way you could've known she'd react that way. Missing in action. I just never thought about What that means as a mother. It was heartbreaking, michael. I mean, for us... We can take some comfort in-in visiting amanda. Edie had no body to bury, No place to be with her son. I'm sorry I'm not there to help. I fly out right after tomorrow's committee meeting. Michael, I was thinking maybe, um, Maybe we could do something special for ie, Here at fort marshall. That's a great idea. Let me think about it. I gotta get back to my meeting. Okay. How's it going? I'm cautiously optimistic. Good. Okay, love you. Love you, too. Come in. I thought maybe you'd like some tea. I'm not interrupting, am I? Oh, not at all. Tea sounds perfect. I'm so sorry that I ruined your weekend, honey. No, that's okay. I'm sure that hanging out with your friends Would be a heck of a lot more fun, right? No. Really, it was cool. Oh... Thank you. I'm really sorry about your son. Thank you, honey. You would've liked him. Bobby loved people. He could talk to anybody. And, boy, when he came into a room, That place would just light up. I wish I'd known him. You two really would've hit it off. And you know what? He was the biggest hockey fan. Really? I still have boxes and boxes full of souvenirs. And I still have An autographed hockey stick from bobby hull. No way. Yes. Would you like it? Are you kidding? It's yours. That's awesome. This was your sister's room, wasn't it? Life can be so cruel. I would love to hear more about your side of the family. You would? We moved around so much when I was younger, I feel like I missed things. Well, I've got an idea. Why don't you come visit me in tampa? Hmm. Have you been to florida? Never. Then it's a must. There's a lot to do, and I've got photo albums, Including pictures of your father That I bet he doesn't have. How about it? Cool. Definitely. Okay, great. Now what kind of cookies did you bring? Uh, vegan coconut agave. Okay. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? Okay. I made 'em myself. Mmm. Don't give me the recipe, okay? Hey, babe. How was the game? It was great. Tommy threw a shutout. They won 5-nothing. Nice. So are you almost home? Uh... Not exactly. I'm still on the outskirts of columbia. What? Babe, the mustang-it- - it died on me. Ha ha, very funny. No, rox, I'm not joking. Yeah, you're probably pulling up in the driveway right now With your mother's day surprise. Babe, I'm not kidding. I'm stuck. Oh, trevor. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It's the mustang that needs work. It's not gonna be ready till after dark. Aw, damn it, trevor. I hate that car. We should've gotten rid of it a long time ago. I know, I know. The boys are gonna be really disappointed. I'm disappointed. And don't forget that pamela's coming over With her kids, too. I know. And tell her I'm sorry, But at least you guys have each other, right? Rox? Yeah. All right. Well, you know what? Maybe you guys can all go out to dinner. It's kind of expensive. Don't worry, we'll figure something out. Just get home safe, okay? I will. I'm sorry. Okay. Hey, claudia joy. Hi, pamela. You leave anything for the rest of us? Oh, well, with michael in d.C. , I'm making dinner tonight. For an army, apparently. Denise is joining us now. Frank got called away on maneuvers at the last minute. You're going to roxy's, right? Uh, yeah. Except now, we're cooking. Where's trevor? Stranded about 100 miles away in a dead mustang. Oh! So she asked me to pick up some burgers. No, that's not happening. Everybody's coming to my house. I'll call roland. Really? Yeah. Claudia joy saves the day again? Hey, sure, absolutely. Why not? It'll be fun, right? Ugh! I don't think I have room for dessert. Well, I do. Sara elizabeth is finally down. Oh, she is adorable. Aw, thank you. Her mother's in iraq. I was hoping we'd get a chance to talk today, But they're having sandstorms over there. Communication's down. Aw! Oh! Did you talk to your mother? Uh, mainly, I listened... About how I'm not sending enough photos of sara elizabeth To show off to the ladies at church. And I'm way overdue for a visit. And she also informed me that I don't call her enough. Oh, well, what mom ever thinks that their kids call enough? Certainly not mine. Did you call marda? Yes. How's she doing? Oh, you know marda. Everything's a drama. Sorry. My relationship with my mom is a little... Complicated? Yes, "complicated." okay. That is a good word for it. On mother's day, it was hard to bring breakfast in bed To someone who wasn't even home yet. Oh, dear. My father would make this horrible mother's day brunch, And I was his helper. I was always closer to him than her, actually. Aw. I think all mother/daughter relationships are complicated. Mm. Yeah, I'll vouch for that. Hey, what? You're not supposed to be listening, sweetheart. Sorry. It is funny what we remember. "are you sure you want to wear that?" My mother used to ask me that every time, Right when I was at the front door. Yes. Oh! Right? Really nice. Terrible. Ah. You know, I remember when I was young, We had to pinch every penny. I remember my mother shouting, "close the door! We're not heating the neighborhood!" Well, to claudia joy, For taking us all in. To our mothers, wherever they may be. Hear, hear. Cheers. Cheers. Pick your poison, ma'am. Beef enchilada or chicken fajita? Some choice. The mess was closed due to the sandstorm, ma'am. All right, beef. Mmm, mmm, mmm. I don't know why they call 'em m.R.E.S. They're not meals, They're not ready, And you can't eat 'em. Hey. I almost forgot- happy mother's day. Thanks. All right. Welcome back... We're here with our returning champion mary ellen corman Of mackinaw, illinois. Mary ellen... thanks, jeff... All right, then. You ready to play the bonus round? Yeah, ready. All right, then. Mary ellen... mm. Hey. What time is it? It's midnight. Stupid car. Babe, I am so, so sorry. Mm-hmm. What's this? It's our surprise. Trevor. Oh! "♪1 mom." It's the truth. I love it. Good. Now give it back. What? I gotta wrap it up again So you can open it in front of the boys. What about my other surprise? Do I have to wait for that one, too? Mm. Mnh-mnh. Good. Batter up. Frank? Oh, hey. Hey, how'd it go? Good. Good. It went good. Ow! My back hurts. But I do love sleeping under the stars. You look nice. Mm. Special memorial service for michael's aunt. She lost her son in vietnam. General holden called me. So give me a few minutes to shower up, And we'll go over together, all right? Okay. Hey, dad. Hey, em. You look nice. Thanks. How'd the hearing go? Fine. Are you gonna save the post? We'll see. I hope so. I like this place. Are you ready? I can't believe all the trouble you went to. It was no trouble at all. I wish uncle joe was here to see this. Me, too. Thank you all for coming. This is a special day for my family. We're here to remember Private first class robert keith holden... One of our brave soldiers who fought in vietnam, One who remains officially missing in action to this day. He was the only son of joseph and edith holden. And he was my cousin. In 1970, bobby went to aid a wounded soldier And was never seen again. He was just 18 years old. I was a boy at the time, But his selfless act inspired me even then. Yet, 40 years later, Bobby still hasn't returned home, And his absence has left a hole In the fabric of our family, One which we hope to repair, If only in part, today. Aunt edie, For four decades, you've had no grave to visit, No headstone to lay flowers upon. With your blessing, We'd like you to think of this sacred spot At fort marshall As bobby's memorial... A place you are always welcome, A place to reflect on the life of your son. The yellow rose is a symbol of remembrance, And we here Honor the memory of bobby holden. Today, he has come home. Thank you all so very much. Present arms! Order arms! Little more. That way. Whoa! Whoa! Feels good, doesn't it? Yes, ma'am. What's that? It's for you, ma'am. It was supposed to be delivered yesterday. Thank you, sergeant. You're welcome, ma'am.
