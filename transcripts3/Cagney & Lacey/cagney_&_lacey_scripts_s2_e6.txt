 Your father had a regular route. He hit up all the merchants on the street. Don't you talk to me that way, Chrissie, I'm your father. What time is it? 2:19. Sorry I asked. ISBECKI ON RADIO: What do you sa y we call it a night? Hang in there. I think you ladies have been stood up. You talking from experience? - Later, Cagney, it's going down. - 10-4. - PETRIE: Hold it right there. - ISBECKI: Freeze, and don't get cute. - Hey, who are you? - Police. Would you step down, please? All right, all right, maybe I pushed the limit a little bit getting here.

 - Yeah, that's not all you're pushing. - What the hell are you talking about? You tell me. You're nuts, you're nuts. Just check the manifest, I'm just doing a job here. PETRIE: Hey, you guys. Hey, look, I've never been in trouble before. Come on. Give me a break, huh? Everything you need to make a great mai tai, except for the booze. What happened to the hijacked liquor? I want you to know that I gave up a date with Jessica for this. Ortiz said he had an inside line on this shipment. He was right in there, how could he be wrong? It's a new cover, takes time. He said it was a sure thing. How many really sure things are there in life? Jessica. Jessica was a sure thing. Good news, Mr. Krupp. We found your missing car. Oh, yeah? Along with the car, we found your brother-in-law. He says you paid him to steal it. Oh, yeah? Could you tell me why you had four different insurance policies? Oh. Yeah. OFFICER: Okay, okay, just give it to me slow. All right? Was anyone injured? Was there any damage to property? Was the damage greater than $250? Look, I hate asking these questions, too, all right? But I've got to ask them. - Very nice. - So I said to him, "Harv, honey, "it's 4:00 in the morning." And he said, "No time like the right time." We were talking about getting a pizza. You know, you got a one-track mind these days. - Pizza? - Henry. Huggable Henry. Isn't that what I heard you call him on the phone? You shouldn't be listening to my private calls. She's got kind of a glow lately, don't you think? Yes, I thought your skin was clearing up nicely. You guys! - Sin and redemption! - Get me out of here. This guy is on fire! - We got a fire. - Fire! WOMAN: What's going on in there? OFFICER: Put it down. - SAMUELS: Is he all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Get him to a hospital. He set his leg on fire. I don't think it's too bad. Yeah, well, have them examine his head. - I'm fine. - What's this here? Some guy thinks he's Joan of Arc. Come here. WOMAN 1: It's nice to know that we are in it... WOMAN 2: Today's getting weirder and weirder. - Ortiz... - This man set himself on fire in his cell. Ortiz doesn't know what went wrong last night. - Sorry, guys, I heard it was a bummer. - Yeah, what happened? Well, I was working the loading dock, and the foreman says that there was gonna be a delivery of cases of liquor to the West 19th Street warehouse, supposedly hijacked from a truck in North Carolina. Right from the horse's mouth. Could it have been re-routed the last minute? This time I'm gonna get it on tape. CAGNEY: You're gonna go in with a wire? Well, I don't want you girls to freeze your tuchuses again on account of me. - Just be careful. - No problem. (SPEAKING SPANISH) All right, come on, why don't we go have some lunch? - Yeah? - What's the occasion? No occasion, just an ordinary lunch. What happened to my suspect? Ladies. Bert, over here, please. This is Anthony Berwick, Internal Affairs division. - How do you do? - Huh. Hello. - Do you like Dover sole? - Yes, sir. Great, we're in luck. As you know, Detective Ortiz has been working undercover with the D.A.'s crime unit on interstate truck hijacking. We believe Dave Sandridge is the kingpin. They know that, they were on a stakeout that went bust. We think we know why. - We believe the hijackers were tipped off. - By whom? A leak, your squad. And you suspect Ortiz? No, we suspect everybody. But not us? Well, you're females. - You have an advantage. - Such as? Females haven't been in the department long enough. Bad guys don't trust them. Besides, we checked you out. (SPEAKING FRENCH) You'll be part of our internal investigation. You will report on other detectives. My cover will be Ms. Cagney's insurance agent. When I call, you will return my call from a secured phone outside the squad room. - Forget it. - All right. If not insurance agent, bookie. You need a sense of humor in this job. I find nothing funny about spying on people that I work with. Neither do we. We have the utmost concern for our undercover officers. Sir, what if we don't want to do it? Detective is an appointed rank you serve at the pleasure of the Commissioner. Your position is tenuous, to say the least. You will have to do what you think is right, sir, as will I. Don't threaten them, Berwick. I know my people. We don't have a leak. This is just an excuse for IAD to meddle in local precinct affairs, that's all. We got a problem, we'll handle it. We don't need you. You're in trouble, Bert, whether you know it now or not. - You need help. - I don't think so. What is this, fish? - Good stuff, huh? - You want stereo equipment, designer jeans, $85,000 worth of shrimp. If it travels by truck, Sandridge's guys got it. Hot and cheap. - The D.A.'s gonna love it. - They may even release the album. CAGNEY: Come on. All right. - You got an envelope? - Come on, give me a break. Yeah. - What's the score? - H-O-R, H-O-R-S. No problem, you're finished. It's over for you, Petrie. - SHELLEY: Can I have winner? - No. I got winner, shorty. Stick around, guys, we'll have a search warrant for tonight. - "E." - Oh, shoot, come on. All right. Give me that ball. So, this is where the taxpayers' money goes, eh? - Pop. - Hi. - Hi, how are you doing? - Oh, hello, nice to see you. - Hey, good to see you again. - Hi, how are you? Watch this. - Chrissie, I told you it's all in the wrist. - I just don't want to intimidate him. Come on, talk to me. Come on. - I'll be back, save my place. - Excuse me. Travel. What you doing here? I just came back to make sure my old captain hadn't dropped dead of a heart attack or something. I need him for a reference. I'm applying for a job. - Terrific. What job? - Well, there's some outfit on Wall Street, stocks and bonds. They need a courier with an impeccable background. And I mean, who's more impeccable than a retired cop? That's great, Pop. - Can you stay? Do you want some coffee? - Yeah, sure. - Love it. - Okay. So, what do you think of the old place? - Still smells the same. - Same coffee, too. THUG: Pin him down. Pin him down. Come on, get that tape. Close the door. Ortiz is in the hospital. Somebody leaned on him pretty bad. Is he okay? He will be. Someone found out what he was doing. Got the tape. Not his wristwatch, not his wallet. Just the tape. I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. I can't believe that one of my own people did it. But it's true. So, we're gonna have to play ball with IAD. Try and plug that leak. Sir, exactly what does that mean? What that means is that you two are working for Berwick. Do what he tells you. Go on. Get out of here. We approach it like we approach any other case. Motivation, opportunity. Petrie. Motivation, new baby on the way, needs the money. Opportunity, he's around the squad room all the time. Isbecki. - Motivation... - Stupidity. Figured he'd get away with it once and then got in over his head. La Guardia. Ready to retire. Bitterness towards the department because he never made First Grade Detective. - That's imaginative. - Yeah. - Ortiz. - No, I don't think it's him. Shelley. - She's a civilian. - Well, she's still got ears. Maybe. How about helping to finance the honeymoon with huggable Henry? See that guy? He's very cute. - Detective Riley. - Money. - Taubman. - Money. - Cosetti. - Money. All right. Okay. - We're getting somewhere. - Yeah? Where? All right, hold it down, hold it down. With Ortiz out of action, we're all going to pitch in with the D.A. on his hijacking investigation. - Petrie, you cover street vendors. - Yeah, okay. He doesn't sound very enthusiastic. La Guardia, go after truck drivers and small-time wiseguys with priors to this kind of operation. - You got it. - And he's too enthusiastic. Riley will check with interstate... I don't know, this is so tough. You and Cosetti will work on insurance companies. Isbecki, these are the shipping manifests that Ortiz was able to copy. See that you check them out. Cagney and Lacey, see if you can run down stolen goods in any retail stores. Okay, Lieutenant. Wouldn't you know the girls get to go shopping? Excuse me, Chris, your insurance agent called again, wants you to call him back. Thank you. - Insurance hassle? - Do I know? My brother-in-law is an insurance salesman and he's a terrific... All right, come on, let's go. This is not a coffee klatch. - I'll give Cagney his number. - Swell. We're not getting anywhere. You have a problem with the solvability quotient. CA GNEY ON TELEPHONE: I know. It stinks. I trust it's not the same with the other cases. My other cases don't involve spying on m y friends. You're gonna have to roll up your sleeves. Get your hands dirty. I feel pretty filthy already, Mr. Berwick. Remember, this jeopardizes the lives of your fellow detectives. - I know it. - Look into their financial records. - Get out there, follow them. - Follow who? Anyone, Mark Petrie. - Why Petrie? - Taubman, Isbecki, La Guardia. Pick one, get started. Well, couldn't you get me a better rate on my loft? These premiums are ridiculous. I didn't know Isbecki was a stereo freak. Well, there's probably a lot of things about him you don't know. Which I can't wait to find out. - Isbecki? - Yeah, yeah. That's the name, I took care of him. - Could we see a sales slip, please? - Oh, sure. Let's see. Yeah, right here, Isbecki. $3,742? Yeah, but he got a good buy. I mean, that is a $5,000 unit. - It's state of the art. - What's the down payment? No down payment, he put it all on his card. All of it? The card wasn't a phony, was it? Okay, thanks a lot. Isbecki's got a $4,000 credit line. How come we earn the same and the best I can do is $500? Makes you wonder, doesn't it? I cannot tell you how much I hate doing what we're doing. You want some lunch? Leftover veal piccata. - What, you had company? - No, I made it for myself. - Is that a yes or a no? - Yeah, yes, thank you. Oh, it isn't fair. Wouldn't it be terrific if it turned out that Berwick was spying on us, too? Ortiz wouldn't still be in the hospital if somebody hadn't blown it for him. That's the only thing that keeps me going. You know, I've been hanging around the department since I came to live with my dad when I was 13. And I believe a cop should be above reproach. What fairytale is that from? (DOORBELL BUZZING) Should be, I said. Should be. Berwick. What a surprise. Nice place you have here. Very nice. Well, I bought this about 10 years ago when the neighborhood was really lousy, from some money that my mother left me. There's no reason for paranoia, Detective Cagney. - Sir, what can we do for you? - Progress report. We tailed Isbecki to a stereo store where he purchased $3,700 worth of components. That's not so outlandish. Unless he paid cash. He put it on his credit card. He has a $4,000 credit line, okay? I'll follow up on that. Meanwhile, you'll notice that someone who was at our last meeting isn't with us now. Michel, the waiter? - I want you to follow Lieutenant Samuels. - I beg your pardon? Do you mind? That was a present. From Henry. - SAMUELS: Shelley. - Yes, sir. Get me those shipping manifests that Ortiz brought in. - The D.A. wants them pronto. - Right away, Lieutenant. - Your calendar is three months behind. - I like the view. (PHONE RINGS) Detective Isbecki, 14th Squad. Who? Yes. - I've got the envelope, sir. - Yeah. - It's empty. - What? Right away. Remind me to call my father. He's coming for dinner this week. - Did he get that courier job? - That's what I'm gonna find out. I wouldn't go in there. - What's the problem? - He's out of his mind. You know those shipping manifests, the ones Ortiz copied? They are missing from the property book. - Wasn't Isbecki working on those? - Yeah, but he gave them back to Samuels. I remember seeing them on Samuels' desk. But now he's acting like he's never seen them. Like he really wants to put the blame on me, or Isbecki or somebody else. - Detective Isbecki was very helpful. - What'd he tell you? There's a reason the man can spend that kind of money on a stereo system. He has a trust fund of $125,000. - What? - Are we talking about the same Isbecki? His grandfather owned a small carpet store in the Bronx. Had the same name as a large chain that came along later. When they realized that they couldn't operate in New York due to the prior registration, they negotiated a settlement. Isbecki's father invested his share of the settlement in IBM stock. - That was 20 years ago. - And now Isbecki is rich. Well, depends on your definition of the term. It's a nice nest egg. At any rate, he's no longer under suspicion. No, come on. This doesn't make any sense. The guy drives an old, ratty car. Hell, you ought to see his apartment. - When were you in his apartment? - He's deeply embarrassed. He doesn't want anyone to know. That's good. - Good? - It makes him more cooperative, sure. - Does he know that we know this? - No, and I wouldn't tell him. Might jeopardize the investigation. I want to hand in our report at the end of the week. Get it over and done with. What if we don't have anything to report? So we hand in the forms. We did our job. I know Bert Samuels 10 years. There's no way he'd turn against the department. Tailed him twice to the same building. Same time every time. So that's all we have to say. We don't have to draw conclusions. Don't take it personally. Samuels wouldn't. We're doing a job that has to be done. I'd rather we drew conclusions than the IAD. There was this man over in Arson. - Ken Miller, really nice man. - Yeah. Detective 14 years. And a guy in his squad was being investigated by Internal Affairs, so Miller intervened on his behalf. He was charged with interfering with the efforts of the Department. Busted back to patrolling. He's in Bed-Stuy right now, - walking a beat. - Just think of feathers. Just think of falling into a room full of feathers. - You can't believe the power they have. - Yeah, I know, baby, I know. - Harvey... - Hey, come on now, rubbing your back, it takes concentration. - You're judging me, Harv, I know it. - So they put you on a spy job. - That's a crummy thing to say. - What do you want from management? They don't care about you. You know something, Harv? You're not helping me here. Well, how do you want me to help you, my little Mata Hari? - Harvey. - My little sister of Benedict Arnold. Thanks a lot. Wait a minute, hold it. The room may be bugged. How're you doing? No counterfeits here, man. These are all genuine labels. Yeah, I see. I'll take them all. What, are you kidding? No. Let's go. Oh, come on, man. What are you going to hassle me for, huh? The lot numbers on these tags match a Saks shipment that was hijacked last month. So, unless you can prove you're one of their branch stores, let's go. All right, well, look, I bought these from some guy. What if I show you where he is? Do you think we could work something out, huh? We'll talk about it. Wrap it up. Let's go. Get out of my way. Move. Move. - Petrie! - PETRIE: Stay on him. I'm okay. (UPBEA T ELECTROPOP PLA YING ON STEREO) Come on, girls. Now, move those hips. That's it. Come on, smile! Pretty! That's it. Move those hips! Now, come on. Move. Out. Forward. And smile. Move those shoulders. Here we go. Back... And once again, move those... Come on, reach up. Come on. Again. Perfect. Go, move. (WOMEN SCREAMING) Give it up! Give it up, man! Open your hand and drop it! Open your hand! CAGNEY: Stay right where you are. You'll be fine. All right, move over here. On your belly. You all right there, ladies? Hands behind your back. That's it. Nice assist. What are you two doing here anyway? Yeah, lucky, huh? You weren't visiting your insurance agent? What are you talking about? There's lots of rumors lately, since Isbecki got called out by IAD. Some people think there's an investigation going down in our squad room. Really? If IAD were gunning for a friend of mine, I'd certainly try to let them know about it. And I would hope my friends would do the same for me. - Let's get back, huh? - Level with me? We heard the rumors, too. Uh-huh. CAGNEY: Do you notice La Guardia's dressing a lot better lately? There's his contact. Contact for what? I can't stand it. La Guardia's got a girlfriend. Well, somebody's actually got something nice in their life. I think I'm gonna cry. - Come on. - Leave me alone. This is great. The perp, Mario Patterson, who you two nailed with the designer jeans, is in talking with Petrie right now. He is definitely involved with this hijacking operation. Good news. Guess we got lucky, huh? It seems he was hired by a man in Philadelphia who he's never met to go down there and drive a truckload of stuff back here to New York. What kind of stuff? It could be anything. He doesn't know the destination here. Says they're gonna tell him that when he gets down there. - Isbecki, I want you to go down there. - Down to Philly? They never met the guy, right? So you're him. - Sure, you look like a Mario, Isbecki. - Yeah. Drive the truck back here. We'll meet you and our hijackers wherever they tell you. Any problems? No, sir. Okay. Listen, keep it quiet. With all the problems we've being having here, I don't want anyone except the people in this room to know what you're doing. - Understood. - Right, sir. So, Isbecki, that'll be a good assignment for you, huh? Yeah. It'll keep you out of trouble for a while. Well, it's a good thing you two were around to catch the guy. LACEY: I found this in my desk drawer, sir. We are resigning from this investigation. We have our reports here. It pretty much covers what we know of everybody, which is that they all appear to be clean, sir. I can appreciate how traumatic it must have been for you to find this. I'm sure you can. We still have to work with these people. Some of them used to be friends. You still haven't found the leak. If there is one and frankly, I don't... - So, you haven't completed... - No. ...the assignment. I'm sorry. We've invested too much to pull you off at this point. It's tough, but try to stick it out. We can't. I'm sorry. I should speak for myself. I can't and I won't. Neither will I, Mr. Berwick. I'm surprised at you, Detective Cagney, with your family's history of service to the Department. Your father's a retired patrolman. - Right. - Charles F. Cagney. In fact, he's applying for departmental references right now, for a job as a courier on Wall Street. It was sweet of you to keep in touch. It's a bonded position. He can't get it without our blessing, which we'd be happy to give in spite of his record. What are you talking about? September 23rd, 1948. Suspended without pay for two months for taking bribes. My father? What're you trying to pull? Oh, yes. Your father had a regular route. He hit up all the merchants on the street. Probably kept you in diapers. If we tell his new employers, he won't get the job. We have no reason to do that, of course, if you and Detective Lacey decide to stay on the investigation. I'm sorry. I'll talk to her. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLA YING ON STEREO) (DOORBELL BUZZING) (MUSIC BLARING) (DOORBELL BUZZING) Don't your ears ache? You're gonna make yourself deaf playing your music that loud. I left a message for you to call me. I figured you could tell me whatever you wanted to tell me - when I got here. - You really should have returned my call. I want to cancel dinner. Well, since I don't smell anything cooking I figured that dinner was canceled. No matter. I'm gonna take my best girl out to dinner. Chrissie, I got the job. What's the matter, baby? You okay? Hey, we don't have to go out. We can just sit around here and gas. Why didn't you ever tell me you were on the take? What? Why'd I have to hear it from some IAD slime bag in front of people that I work with? Don't you talk to me that way, Chrissie, I'm your father. September 1948, you were reprimanded, suspended for two months and fined for taking payoffs. You don't know what you're talking about. - You didn't even try and tell me. - There's nothing to tell you. You could have told me why. You could have told me you were sorry. Things were different then, Chris. The department was different. No! You give me something, Charlie. You give me something! I need it! When you walk a beat as long as I did, Chrissie, you get to know the people, you get to know the neighborhood. A bartender wants to keep a card game going. A restaurant owner wants to park a few cars in a no-parking zone. What's the big deal? These people were my friends. Did you need the money? Was somebody sick, Daddy? Give me something. - You don't hear one word I'm saying! - Yeah, I'm trying! It was the '40s. Hey, Chris, please. I came here to celebrate. I just got a new job. He said you were on the pad. He said every week you took 30 bucks on the dole. I'll see you later, Chris. We'll celebrate when you're feeling better. I don't want you to leave now. I want you to stay and talk to me. You ready to go? Samuels just left. How'd it go last night? Lousy. - You got a cigarette on you? - Huh? I feel like having a cigarette. You have one? Maybe we can buy a pack and split it. I just want this thing to be over with. It won't be much longer. Isbecki called in from Philly this morning. He's on one of the trucks coming in to Sandridge's warehouse. So, you think we'll be in on the collar? I don't know. Samuels hasn't made the assignment yet. Samuels might never make the assignment until it's too late. That was crummy, Christine. Well, I'm in a crummy mood. So, you want to follow Samuels or not? Chris. If you're angry with your father, take it up with him. With me, lighten up, all right? He's got a woman in there. I know it. - This is an office building, not a hotel. - You never read The Happy Hooker? He's been here four times the last eight days. Something is not right. Well, that's what we're here to find out, isn't it? We are here to find out if he's corrupt. I don't have a good feeling about this. Seventh floor. Well, this is it. Is this the same floor every time he comes here? Sure. You two gonna bust this guy or what? Thanks for your help. Can I come watch? Well, they're all shrinks. Family counseling, psychiatric therapy... Hey, lady? It was Berwick, right? Sir, I'm sorry. I am an honest cop. - I'm so sorry. - Don't be sorry for me. No. I didn't mean that any... I got problems. I'm dealing with them. Here. It's not your business, it's not the Department's. It does not affect my job. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. I'm not asking for any special favor. If you gotta tell Berwick, you tell him. I expect the same sort of confidentiality that you ought to give every other subject in your investigation. I've got an appointment I gotta keep. - I'm not telling Berwick, Chris. - No. SAMUELS: Are you in any danger? I don't think so, but scratch that bust at Sandridge's warehouse. We're not going there. Hold it. Hey, you two. That delivery was solid. Why the switch? Shut the door. All right, go ahead. All I know is suddenly I'm like the walking plague. Guys shut up when I come around. And then I get the word that we're changing our destination. - Where're you going? - I don't know. It's no good. I want you out of there. - What, are you kidding? - Out! Right now! Hop a freight. Run off into the woods. Do whatever you gotta do, just get out of there. Yeah, well, I'll figure out something. I'll let you know. It's too dangerous. I gotta go. I'll see you. Did either of you mention to anybody at all that Isbecki's planted undercover? - No, sir. - Of course not. We've got a problem. All right. It couldn't have been Samuels. It could not have been Isbecki. It wasn't us. - You think the phones are tapped? - Yeah, by Berwick. Maybe, there's a bug in Samuels' office. That's the first place we talked about Isbecki going under. I can't believe I'm thinking these thoughts. - Well. - This is the real world, Christine. This is not James Bond. It's not. Chris, we talked about Isbecki one other place. (WHISPERING) This is crazy. So, Chris, did you mention to anyone about Isbecki being planted? No, of course not. Did we talk about that at our desks? Not that I remember. In the booking area? In our car? At home? Okay. Okay. So... The only kind of bugs we've got in here are roaches and silverfish. If there was a bug, it could have been pulled. This is science fiction. There is no bug here, Mary Beth. Berwick's got us paranoid. Well, then it's just us. We're the only women that use this john. It's a good thing we're putting that new bug in Sandridge's office. It'll be an easy bust after all. - Jeez, and I was supposed to call Harv. - No, no time. - MAN: Hello? - It's me, honey. Hi, me, I miss you. I miss you. Two hours and I get off work. Then you won't be missing me anymore. I've got something, Henry. They said they're putting a bug in Mr. Sandridge's office. You're terrific, baby. You know that? All in a da y's work. I love you. Do you want us to take her? She was my secretary. I'll do it. Isbecki's in danger, Shelley. They've re-routed his truck to another destination, and we don't know where. They wouldn't hurt him. They just don't want to get arrested. - They hurt Ortiz. - It just got a little out of hand. They're gonna hurt him. Maybe even kill him. And you'll be charged as an accessory, Shelley. I'll charge you myself. Why didn't you stop this after they beat up Ortiz? Why do you think? - Henry. - Yeah. Oh, come on. What do you know, guys falling all over you? Henry was the only winner I ever had. - We understand. She understands that. - No, I don't understand that. Okay, Shelley, you did it for this man. I can understand that. But now we gotta talk about Isbecki. I'm not sure where they're sending him. Just tell us what you know. It was something about the East warehouse. That's all I know. Could be one of Sandridge's warehouses. It's not working. A hell of a problem. I'll get on the horn with Intelligence. They'll give us what they know. I always liked Isbecki. You know that, Mary Beth. Sure. I'm sorry. - Chris, your father called. - Thank you. - Christine, he's your father. - Stay out of this. La Guardia, Cagney, Lacey, I got a location on the East warehouse. - That's where Isbecki is. - Is he all right? I don't know. Let's roll. Let's roll. Excuse me, buddy. I don't get it. How can we unload without a dock crew? Oh, we got a dock crew. See? Terrific. Why don't I go around and unlatch the trailer? Oh, yeah. I think we've got some company. No kidding, cop.
