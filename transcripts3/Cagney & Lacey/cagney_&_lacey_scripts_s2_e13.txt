 - We're going to miss Samuels' speech. - Good. We didn't get a welcoming speech on our first day, did we? We weren't very welcome, remember? It's her second day, she made a mistake. It's not experience. It has to do with where your head's at. - It's Cagney, right? - What is? She's jealous because I called the murder. What, women are supposed to stick together no matter what? Come on. I stopped believing that when I threw away my "you've come a long way, baby" keychain. It looked as if it was mine.

 You never thought that you might be doing something illegal? All right, everybody down! LACEY: Will you come on? CAGNEY: We're still early. - Four minutes. - What are they gonna do, fire us? Here, hold this. - We're going to miss Samuels' speech. - Good. We didn't get a welcoming speech on our first day, did we? We weren't very welcome, remember? - Damn. Look at this. - What're you doing? Every time they put the cream cheese on one side, I've told them I really hate it. Could you wait to do that until we are at the squad room? If I wait I'm gonna starve. You know, every time I run in there he throws another case at me. Well, maybe with the new kid coming on, things will ease up.

 I doubt it. I don't know, maybe. You heard anything about her? We will see soon enough if we ever get there. Would you relax? Here, eat some. I'm telling you. You feel better if you have a nice leisurely breakfast to start off the day. So I guess the department finally sized the scene up around here and realized we need help. Not that I'm saying that you people aren't doing your jobs, but the more, the merrier. Right? So I am happy to introduce to you the newly appointed detective, Diane Turner. - Turner's fine. - Turner. And I know that you're all gonna wanna give her the big one-four hello. So go ahead and do that. Diane, the force is with you. All right, that's it. Let me show you your desk here. - Get mine, would you? - Yeah. You missed the big speech. Nuts. So how's the new girl? - She's good... - Never mind. I'll find out for myself. - Why? - Because if she's your type, which we've narrowed down to anything that breathes, you probably hit on her. If she said no, you'll probably tell me she's a bimbo, and if she said yes, then I don't want to know. I don't hit on every girl I meet. I didn't hit on Mary Beth. - Well, she's married. - Yes, you did. - When? - Never mind. Oh, I knew this was coming, another girl in the squad room. Look, would you just be nice to her, huh? Make an effort. Are you telling me I should give her my special treatment? No, I'm telling you, you shouldn't. SAMUELS: Good morning. You're late. Sorry, we missed the speech, sir. Hello. - Hi. - It's okay. It's all right. This is Detective Diane Turner. These are Detectives Mary Beth Lacey and Christine Cagney. - Congratulations. - Thank you. You're gonna be working together the next couple of weeks. - LA GUARDIA: Lieutenant. - Yeah. - Telephone. - Okay, be right there. - You're on patrol today. - We were just on patrol yesterday. No kidding. But Tauberman and Cosetti hit on something hard on the elevator robberies and I got no one I can spare. Yes, sir. Once a week, we just have to cruise around and help out uniforms with whatever they need. - I know. - Of course, you do. - You were on the force... - Four years. Really? It took me eight years to make Detective. I got lucky. It was probably harder in those days anyway. Back in the '40s. Oh, I don't know. LACEY: So, where were you in uniform? - 3-0. - Yeah? - Up by Morningside? - Yeah. I got used to it. Part of me even liked it. About six months ago, I was thinking about quitting and I don't know... Anyway, I got a lot of attention after the Savage Night case, so I decided to stick around and see if anything came of it. That was you that cracked that? - I found them. Yeah. - Wow. Why were you thinking of quitting? It was a rough time. You get tired. You start hating the money. Not having any, which is funny because that's why I became a cop. - What, for the money? - Look around. This pays pretty well. Yeah, but a lot of jobs pay this well. Yeah, but where can you beat the hours? - I like the hours. - Yeah. I do. I took some medical courses at night so I could maybe work as a lab technician. They do all right. You think you're not... You never think of leaving? Yeah, about four or five times a day. I never would, though. This is what I've always wanted to do. - That must be nice, having that. - Yeah. Yeah, it is. Would you slow down? Stop showing off. We gotta show Diane a little action here. Come on, it's her first day and she's stuck on patrol. Hell, you could have stayed in uniform for that. No, it's great. How soon do you think before we hit something hot? - You're really cooking, aren't you? - I just want to get started. What's that? - Let's try it. - You got it. Hiya, Gettins. - GETTINS: They sent the first team in, huh? - Yeah. What's going on? We've got the arson guy upstairs. He's snooping around. - Any other detectives here? - No. It looks pretty routine. - Well, we better check it out anyway. - Right. Tell the cops no autographs, huh? (WOMAN COUGHING) DIANE: It smells in here. CAGNEY: Yes, it's a local roach motel. They all hang out here. Hookers, junkies. Anybody who needs a roof for a few minutes. What are you ladies doing in here? Oh, Detective Cagney, 14th Squad. Oh, Diane, hey. I didn't recognize you out of uniform. - Hi, Ben, how's it going? - We just found a woman inside. - Dead? - Yeah. Of course, I think it's a woman. It's a little hard to tell. She's over here. The Medical Examiner's on his way. - Dear Lord. - Any sign of arson? Not that we found. Pack of cigarettes, a few needles lying around. From the looks of it, the fire must have started right in here. So, some junkie looking for a place to sleep. Poor thing. Hey, careful. Don't touch anything. Any pocketbook or ID? No. She was killed before the fire. Look in the left eye. You can see some ruptured blood vessels. She was strangled. That's what happens. Maybe. There's some hemorrhaging, but I... No, it's really there. Petechial hemorrhage. Well, this is very slight here. She died facing downwards, could be natural causes. I guess it could. Maybe. When you're ready, we'll show you how to fill out your DD5's. - Great. I'll just be a couple of minutes. - Okay. - You want a candy bar? - No, thanks. What? - How do you think she's gonna work out? - She'll be fine. Why not? I don't know. I always get nervous when I hear people are in it for the money. Well, then you better be nervous about 80% of the force. That's why I did it. Yeah, well. Sometimes it works out, you know. - Thank you. - Sure. So, how'd it go? She'll be very good, sir. Look, I'm gonna have to file reports on her so I'm gonna expect you to be straight with me. No, really. She is fine. It's just, she's a little overeager, but it's her first day. What do you mean, overeager? What is she doing, beating up on perps? What? Oh, no. We found a fire victim today and she immediately decided it was a homicide. You know, she's looking for that kind of thing everywhere. Well, it's her first day. What'd you expect? Keep me posted. LACEY: I don't know. Some sort of thing they teach in the Lieutenant's handbook or something. "I'm gonna go grapes?" Honey, what're you doing? I was around the corner on a job. I decided to stop by. They said you'd be back in a few minutes. I figured I'd give you a laugh. That's funny. Is that cute or... HARVEY: You should have seen your face. Yeah, I'll bet. Hey, where're you going? Hey, Mary Beth! Come on! Come on, would you knock it off? It was a joke. What're you crabbing about? I hate being embarrassed, Harv. It wasn't embarrassing. It was surprising and humorous. - I hate surprises, okay? - You love surprises. You remember the time we were in Atlantic City? - When? - When? Years ago, huh? When the place was still just a place with a boardwalk, huh? We went to our room in the little hotel. What? That was a different kind of surprise, Harv. The new girl, she working out okay? - Yes, she's good. - You're kidding. No, she's good. She'll be good. She's just... It's her... Today is her first day. - No, it's gonna work out for her. - Sure. Sure. Okay, it's weird having another woman here. Okay, jeez. That's equality for you. It's her first day and she's very excited. - Was I like that my first day? - Yes, yes. You still are. Sometimes. I do think that Christine scares her a little. What about you? Yeah. Well, she can scare me, too, when she works at it. Oh, I mean, do you scare the kid? Me? No. I'm not the scary type. Oh, no, huh? CAGNEY: May I cut in? - Hiya, Chris. - Hi, Harvey. I just got a call from the ME's office. They did a check on that body from the fire. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. The woman was murdered. Strangled. Just like Diane said. Here are those pictures I was telling you about. Is that really you? I was taller then. They used to assign me to escort all the celebrities. Of course, they had their own security people. But they always wanted an NYPD uniform in there. Who was your favorite? Eleanor Roosevelt. She was something very special. And Virginia Mayo. We looked great together. Diane, I heard about that terrific call you made. - Congratulations. - Oh, thank you. - Thanks very much. - Oh, you're quite welcome. What'd I miss? We have a new hero in the squad room. Oh, good for her. Yeah. No, I mean it. She's very lucky. Well, it was a lucky call anyhow. Come on. She called it, we didn't. What can you do? Well, she had medical training. We didn't. I mean, any doctor or nurse could have done the same thing. - What're you worried about? - I'm not worried. I'm just... I'm jealous and I'm feeling sorry for myself. - Okay, that's different. - No, I'm glad for her. I am. I'm just... I gotta stop remembering things. You mean like what we went through when we first showed up here? Yeah. Little stuff like that. Oh, well, it made us strong, right? Hey, good for her. Morning. How are you? - Good. - Good. What do we do now? Well, we usually have a couple of cups of coffee, sit around and see if anybody brought in some Danish. As far as the investigation, I guess we should try to identify the body. Yeah, the dental records. Don't you have to know who the person is first? We can't schlep around every dentist in New York. Dental records are used all the time to identify Jane and John Does. We check with Missing Persons. We should canvass the area, talk to neighbors, find out if someone saw anything going on. The Medical Examiner's office is working up a sketch. That'll take a couple of days. Yeah, they reconstruct it from the skeleton and hair fragments. I know. Sorry. Well, maybe we don't have to wait here. We have a general description. That's enough to go on for now. I think so. Let's roll. Maybe Mary Beth got something from one of the storekeepers. Fifty-seven apartments. Shouldn't one of them have seen something? Get used to it. That's how it usually works out. - It seemed like a long shot anyway. - That's all it ever was. I don't want to just lose this. We'll get it. This stuff just takes time. You mind if we get something to eat? I'm starved. - What're you looking at? - That woman. - We didn't talk to her, did we? - I don't remember. DIANE: We must have. We rang every doorbell. I don't think so. Come on. Third floor, front. Mrs. Houghton, were you looking out the window before the fire started? Of course. So much happens out there, I wouldn't miss it. Look. Look. MRS. HOUGHTON: I don't like the TV anymore. All the stories are about rich people's troubles. And the game shows. I know I'll never have any of those things. I've seen all the movies they show. So I just watch outside, make up my own. Do you remember seeing anyone go into that building yesterday afternoon? A man and a woman. Not a couple, you know, but together. They got out of an automobile. Like a taxicab, but not. - What do you mean? - It wasn't yellow. It was red. But she was in the back and he drove. Like a taxicab, but not. Now, they weren't happy. - Please. - Excuse me. She didn't want to go with him, but he forced her inside. I believe she was crying. - Would you like some tea? - No. No, thank you. Thank you, though. What else do you remember? Nothing. It wasn't a nice movie, so I stopped. Could you describe the man to us? No. Please, Mrs. Houghton. This is very important. I don't remember him. That's all right. He wasn't nice, was he? If you could just describe him for us, we would appreciate it. Anything you say will be held in confidence. No one has to know where it came from. You promise me? Yes. Please. Mrs. Houghton, the man you saw yesterday may have killed that woman and if you don't tell us, he could be free, he could come back. I forget. I don't remember anything. Just follow my lead. That's all you have to do. I thought I was supposed to be a detective. Look, I'm sorry. I'm just not used to being a teacher. Mary Beth has had a lot of experience, and we've been in uniform a lot of years. Well, I've been out in the trenches, too, you know. It just seemed like a little intimidation would work there. You have got to learn to read the people you're talking to. - I did. - And what did you see? Someone we were supposed to get information from. No. I mean, who did you see? What do you have to give Adele Houghton to get what you want? Never mind. We'll talk about it on the way in. Maybe she didn't realize what she was doing. What, are you listening to me? That's what I'm saying. You talk to Samuels? Hell, no. I want to give her a chance. I spent all afternoon trying to explain to her what it was she did wrong. Chris, could we talk about this in a little while? Because you're making me nervous here. What? You were perfect in practice. Relax. It's no different. The difference is that this one counts. I tell you, our one witness, and she scares her away. Mary Beth, if you'd been there, you would have known how to talk to her. Well, we can still bring her in. We'll just... We'll subpoena her. Sure, if she even remembers what he looks like. The woman is a little off the planet. I realized the minute I walked in she needed special handling. - It was going very well. - I can't hear you, Christine. Swell. Thanks. I tell you, Mary Beth, - I don't think she gets... - Are you talking to me? - What? - Never mind. I said I don't think she gets it! It's her second day, she made a mistake. It's not experience. It has to do with where your head's at. - Whose head? - Diane's. I don't think she has it. You are making me nervous here. I want it to work out. I really do want to help her. It's just... Look at that. Look at that. That's two points off. I told her, tomorrow morning to go down to Missing Persons, and see if she can find anybody who fits. - I don't even know if she can handle that. - I told you not to talk to me. Now I gotta come back here and do this over again. Thank you very much, Christine. I had an extra. ...could be the answer because I'm just... If you were waiting here as I have, I'm tired of it. You look like you put your finger in a light socket. - Look, but it's easy... - Morning. What, did you get up at dawn? No, it didn't take long. I just finished a few minutes ago. You know, I never realized how many people disappear in this city? Well, we were gonna meet you upstairs. We just picked up a reconstruction sketch of the victim. Let me see. No. I went over all the missing persons reported in the last two weeks... There was nothing. No, there was nobody like this. Did Sam help you? - Who? - Sam. Upstairs. Oh, yeah. He was okay. Well, let's go check again now that we got a good sketch. It's a waste of time. You know, I've been thinking. You said the place was used by junkies and hookers. The killer was probably a dealer or pimp. That's possible, yes, but it's also possible the woman had absolutely nothing to do with the building. She was driven there by somebody else. Remember, that's what Mrs. Houghton told us. I'm not so sure the lady knew what she was saying. I mean, she was really off, Mary Beth. Doesn't it make more sense my way? I can't stand it. Hey, did one of you guys give Isbecki my phone number? (SCOFFS) I would like to talk to you later. So, how're you two guys doing on Diane's homicide case? Fine, thank you. She's okay, you know, I mean, we really lucked out. Listen, Chris isn't being too hard on her, is she? Where'd you hear that? Nowhere. You know how she can get. No, I don't. - You ready? - Oh, sure. Yeah. We're going to lunch. I'll just be across the street if you need me. - See you later. - Yeah. (PHONE RINGS) Detective Lacey, 14th Squad. Sam Kramer, Missing Persons. Oh, hi, Sam, how are you? Look, if you're too busy to talk to me, I don't wanna waste your time. What? Is there something the matter? Well, I left two messages for you. Oh, I've got them right here, Sam, I just walked in. I also told your young lady to have you call me this morning. Diane? Oh, well. I guess she forgot. I'm sorry, Sam. What was it? I pointed this out to her when she was here, but she told me I was off the mark. I mean, like I haven't been doing this for 16 years. What, you got something for us? I just got the coroner's sketch on your homicide. I thought I was onto something before. The general description was close. Now, matching up the pictures... - What? What is it? - A woman disappeared two days ago, last seen a couple of hours before your body turned up. The physical description fits. Sam, would you read it to me, please? Yeah, a Karen Zankowski reported missing by her brother. Last seen leaving the Schreiber clinic with her one-month-old daughter, Alma. I am sure this is the one. Did you find the baby? No. Yeah, I saw Karen that morning before I left for work. She lives two floors up. I've got plenty of room, but my sister likes to be independent, you know. What about the baby's father? They weren't married. He wanted to, but we didn't need him. He took off back to Costa Rica a few months ago. The last time you saw her, Monday, did she say where she'd be that day? She was taking Alma to the clinic. The kid had been up screaming all night. How'd she plan to get there? She was going to take the subway, but I said, "No." I made her use a car service. The drivers own their own cars. They take you around. It's cheaper than a cab. Do you remember the name of that service? Kiev, but I checked them already. They said they dropped her at the clinic, but they were booked when she was ready to come back. She probably took the subway. Independent, you know what I mean? Mr. Zankowski, you wanna look at this picture? This look like your sister? It could be. Yeah. Where'd you get this? Do you know where she is? I hate having to do that. I'm sorry. I was sure. I mean, you said the building was used by hookers and junkies, so I thought... Anyway, the report said she was last seen with a baby and the body we found was alone. Didn't Sam Kramer try and tell you that? Basically, he's just a clerk. I didn't think it was important. You know, we have wasted a lot of time here when we could have been looking for that child. Maybe you shouldn't have sent me to look over that stuff myself. I've only been doing this a few days. The woman that we talked to said that they got out of a car. "Like a cab," she said, "but not." - So, the driver... - Yeah. - Who? - The driver from the car service. Right. Okay, great, so let's bring him in. There's no way we can hold him without a positive ID. - We can question him. - Go easy here, Diane. If he has that baby, we can't panic him. - You really believe it's still alive? - Yes, I do. - Why? - Because I have to. - Is that him, the guy who picked her up? - LACEY: All right, we'll wait. - Thank you, Lieutenant. - Yeah, but I know these boys. Have Petrie here to bring him in in about 10 minutes. All right. The woman said they got out of a red car. There's gotta be 10,000 red cars in this city. Look, you told me the guy called in after he dropped her off at the clinic and took the day off. Now, it could be he waited for her and offered to give her a ride home. My boys don't do that sort of thing. Everything is strictly on the books. Why're you talking to me? We're not saying you're doing anything, we just wanted to... Look, there's a missing baby involved. Miss Gorky... Hey, what kind of crime are we talking about here? LACEY: Do you understand what we told you to do? Look, I don't need this kind of attention. Do you understand what we told you to do? Yes. Thank you. All right, bring him in. Call him in. GORKY: Thibault, Dechter, Buchwald to the office. - Come on, Rae, I'm just getting off. - Look, honey, I know. But these ladies are from the police. They want to talk to you. Gentlemen. Miss Gorky here tells us that Another Day, the soap opera, uses your service to pick up and take their actors to the studio. You know, I love that program. I mean, ever since I was pregnant with my first kid, I just... I got addicted to that program. Anyway, they have an actress, we are not at liberty to say which one, she lost her house keys and she thinks she left it in one of your cars. Yesterday, she was burglarized while she was at work. Ain't that a shame? What we need is for you to come down and do an identification lineup at the station. Does anyone have a problem with that? Do we have a choice? - No. No problem. - Good. Good. Detective Lacey, could I see you outside for just a moment? - You get their names and addresses. - DIANE: Okay. - Excuse me. - Sure. Thank you very much. - We appreciate your cooperation. - Pleasure. - Thank you very much. - Pleasure. - You think he bought it? - Yeah, yeah. - I want you to get rid of Diane. - What do you mean? I told you our witness is scared and she's unpredictable and God knows what Diane's gonna do. So just send her to the lab on some other case. I don't care. Send her anywhere. Just ditch her for a couple of hours. Why do I get stuck with losing her? Because if I have to look at her one more time, I'm gonna kill her. SAMUELS: You just take your time, Mrs. Houghton. I have. I just... I don't know. Perhaps that one on the end there. Number six, step forward please. No, it's not. Perhaps the one in the turtleneck. SAMUELS: Number four, step forward please. I don't know. I wanna get it right. If I don't, he'll be free. He could come back. No, dear. No, he won't. We've been very careful. Nobody knows you're here. Thank you. I want to help you, but I don't know. - CAGNEY: It's all right. It's all right. - That's it. Thank you. All right. We'll have to go through the motions with the others just to cover ourselves. Mrs. Houghton, thank you very much. - Officer Rubick will see you home. - Yes, thank you. Could he stay with me just for a time? Sure. Thank you. It's him. And we can't hold him. But he better not try to skip. You brought him in smart. Fine. We'll thank him, tell him we made a mistake, but we know where to get in touch with him. We'll make him a little paranoid. Paranoid? The man is a psycho. Anyone who takes a woman into a building in broad daylight and does what he did to her is crazy. We've gotta move on this one. If that baby's still alive, I want her found. I want everyone off the charts until we know. - Yes, sir. - Where's Diane? Oh, we sent her out to the lab on that pharmacy break-in. Well, that could have waited. We need her here. What are you two thinking? All right. Come on, let's move. We're gonna be here all night. I'd better call Harv. Samuels said we should be straight with him. Chris, I'm just not sure it's the right time, is all. So, what's our alternative? Keep our mouths shut and let her screw up again? No. No. Great. You know, they think we're jealous of her? Name names, Christine. I've been getting it from everybody. The rookie cop catches the homicide and we didn't. They're crazy about her, you know. Isbecki's been taking her to lunch. La Guardia's been waltzing her down memory lane. Well, Chris, she's a likeable person. - You like her? - I want to. All that hair is a little... Well, she's got a lot of good qualities. She's nice. She dresses well, huh? I would have her as a neighbor. I'd have her over for dinner with the right crowd. I'd let her watch out for my kids. Well, I... No, maybe I wouldn't let her watch out for my kids. What are we doing here? Chris, would we be talking her over like this if she was a man? If she was a man, she never would have been assigned to us. - Christine. - It's true. I know what you're asking. No, I'd... I am treating this woman like I do everybody else. It's just that she happens to be in over her head, Mary Beth. All right, so we watch out for her a little more. We don't give her anything too big. She's young and... I mean, she's starting out. - Okay? - Okay, fine. You're sure? No. Call the people from the clinic to see if the victim talked to anybody or anyone saw her leave. Hi. Did you get that weapon from the lab? - Yeah, I managed. - Oh, good. - What's going on, Mary Beth? - We couldn't get a positive ID. We're looking for evidence of another connection. - Why're you doing this to me? - What? It's Cagney, right? What is? She's jealous because I called the murder. I've seen women like her before. She's trying to force me out. There's a missing child. Maybe dead, maybe worse. What does that have to do with anything? Oh, honey. I wish you knew. You don't really get it at all, do you? Then tell me. That's what you're here for, isn't it? No, it is not. Burke, you doing anything? Run that upstairs for me, will you? Cagney. Lacey. In here. Close the door, Cagney. - You two got a problem? - No, sir. - Yes. - Yes, sir, we do. Well, I'm getting that drift. - You wanna talk to me about it? - Not really, sir. Detective Turner's not up to your standards? If you want the truth, no, she isn't. I expected this from some of the guys out there, not from you two. What, women are supposed to stick together no matter what? Come on. I stopped believing that when I threw away my "you've come a long way, baby" keychain. Do you know how many uniforms are dying to come through these doors? She must have something. Are you aware of the fact that she's the one who cracked the Savage Night case? Well, she spotted the plate and turned in the car. That's what she did. I am not taking her off this investigation. - We did not ask you to, sir. - But you would like it. If we had the option, yes. Come on, Lieutenant, this is important. I don't think she can handle it and we just could move a lot faster without her. Well, there is no option. She's here and she gets the same chance, Cagney, as everybody else gets. - Get back to work. - Yes, sir. (MAN SINGING OPERA) LACEY: Christine, check December 23rd. See if Elena Quintero and/or Karen Zankowski had an appointment at the clinic that day. Quintero. Yeah, 10:00. Zankowski, nothing. What about January 5th? Zankowski, 2:45. Quintero, 3:30. Why? - Wait a minute. - Would somebody shut him up? Bloomingdale's baritone. Isbecki, what've you got for me? The doctor said she brought the kid in for an earache. Didn't mention anything about a driver or anyone else. He thought she was headed for a drugstore after. Yeah, so check out all the pharmacies that are around the doctor's office, and also in the neighborhood where she lives. See if she got the prescription filled. La Guardia. I just spoke to the president of Thibault's bank at home. He says the computer's closed down till 9:00 a.m. All right. Petrie, what about the other patients? - Nothing yet. - Sir. - Yeah. - On Thibault's driving records, we found... His phone bills don't show anything. Of course, maybe I haven't looked at them right. The suspect's work log shows he took a Mrs. Elena Quintero to the same clinic Karen Zankowski took her baby on several occasions. January 5th, they had an appointment one hour apart. - Okay, that's something. - What? That's something more than what we got, that's what. - You got Quintero's address? - Yes, sir. You two head over there. Maybe they talked to each other. - What time is it? - What, am I keeping you up? - Take Detective Turner with you. - Yes, sir. You hear me? Detective Turner. Come on, let's go. No, I... (BABY CRYING) (STUTTERS) I don't know her. Many go to that clinic. Why me? We're talking to a lot of people tonight. Please take one more look, be sure. No, no. I... I'm sure. Why would I? You had an appointment at the clinic the same day she did. Oh, I don't talk to people I don't know. It's very late. You used the same car service, Kiev, and sometimes they double people up, share rides. No, I never did. I always go alone. If you want to look after the baby... No, no, no. My husband takes care of her. Is she sick? When he carried her through, she looked a little flushed to me. She's fine. She cries. I don't mind though. She cries now, at this age. Yeah. - Detective Turner, any questions? - No, no, nothing. Please. It's very late. - Well, thank you. How old is she? - Oh, just a few days. Oh, yeah? Where was she born? Right here at home. Well, my husband helped me. Mrs. Quintero, I saw your baby. She's not a few days old. Oh, yes, I know. She's big. - All my family is big. - I saw her. The way she looked around and held her head up, that's... That only happens after a few weeks. Had you ever met Abel Thibault before he drove you to the clinic? My daughter. What happens to her? We called her uncle. He's on his way in. No, that's not right. She's mine now. Mrs. Quintero. Mrs. Quintero. Do you realize what you've done? I didn't know about her mother, what he did. He said no one wanted her. Oh, God, I do. CAGNEY: Did you ever meet Thibault before he drove you to the clinic? No. He was kind and... He saw my sorrow and was kind. I told him it was the third time. The child I was carrying, I lost. The doctor said, "No more." I couldn't try. Oh, you can't take her. Mrs. Quintero, did Thibault offer to help you? No, I had to give him money. All we had, $3,000. SAMUELS: In cash? No one knew. I said I was carrying a new one of my own. I put things in my dress, rags. It looked as if it was mine. No one knew. You never thought that you might be doing something illegal? I won't let you take her. Detective Turner, would you please step outside? I'm sorry. Mrs. Quintero. Please. No one knew. I said she was born at home. That's why I had to lie to you. If you ask anybody, you would have known, but I didn't lie. She was born with me. I loved her even before I saw her. She's my daughter. LACEY: All right, thank you. You have our number. All right. Thibault keeps his car at the service's garage, but he's not due back until 4:00. Well, we'll send somebody over there anyhow. Do you know his home address? Yes, sir. All right, bring him in. You'd better take some backup. Get Petrie. You've already got Turner. No, we don't. - We're not going out there with her again. - Don't you tell me. I'm still making the assignments around here. You know, word is getting around you two are picking on her. - Who said that? - What? Whispers in the wind. She said it, right? Are you down on her just because she was crying in there? No, sir, that's not an issue. I've seen men break down in this job, too. I am not ready to tell the department that they made a mistake. She is getting this chance. Now, get her and get Petrie and get over there. - I don't even know where she is. - Well, find her now. - I'll check the john. - Right. Petrie, we're on. THIBAULT: Yeah. Who is there? - Con Edison. - Who? Con Edison. I gotta check your meter. Yeah, I'm coming. Police. You're under arrest. (GRUNTS) She's not in the john. She's not in the locker room. - Well, maybe she went home. - I wouldn't be surprised. - Why? - Well, after you made her cry like that. You got the keys? Two of them. The super didn't know which was which. Mr. Thibault. It's Detective Lacey, sir. Sorry to come by so early but it's... We forgot to get you guys to sign a form when we released you the other day. It was my fault. Just... Just dumb, you know. (WHISPERS) Go. - Anything? - Nothing. - There's a pulse. - Thank God. Yeah, La Guardia, it's Cagney. Listen, get an ambulance to 923 East 5th Avenue, apartment 7J. Chris, he took her gun. And put an APB out on Abel Thibault. Yeah, he's armed. And make sure Samuels gets those people over to the garage. No, he won't go there. He knows we're after him. He won't go for his car. Look, hold on a minute. Okay, buses, train stations, airports, La Guardia. What else? The money. He'll need it. He already went through enough trouble for it. You're working on the bank, right? All right, give me his branch number. Fine, just give me the main number. Okay, and get that ambulance here. - How's she doing? - Not good. Diane. You hear me? All right, just don't move. You're safe now. Yeah, this is Detective Cagney, NYPD shield number 730. Look, we need the branch of one of your depositors, an Abel Thibault. T-H-I-B-A-U-L-T. How much longer? He's just at the teller's window now. LA CEY: All right. They know to give him the special pack of money? Yes. You take it easy. We'll get him when he comes outside. Thank you. He's on his way. So... He's seen all three of us before. We don't wanna scare him. Wait till he's clear. Be patient. We've got him. (SIRENS APPROACHING) Thibault! Police! Halt! (WOMAN SCREAMS) All right, everybody down! Get down. Get down! Stay there. - Thibault, halt! - Sir, sir, stay down. All right, get down, all of you! - Out of the way! - PETRIE: Don't anybody move. Get out of the way, sir! Hold it right there! - PETRIE: Hold it. - Down on the floor! (WOMAN SCREAMING) LACEY: Hold it right there! Eighteen bullets to six, Thibault. Stay away from me! Don't give us an excuse, man. I don't care! (SPEAKING FRENCH) (GUN FIRING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) All right. All right. Okay, people, it's just red dye. It's all right. Nobody's been hurt here. I told you it'd work. You can always count on exploding money. - LACEY: Morning. - Morning. How was your weekend? It was okay. I slept through most of it. That sounds nice. Who sent those? - Diane. - No kidding. Well, actually, I sent them to her. She just sent them back to me. Another break-in over at the ice rink on 41st. Oh, come on. The week's just started. We've already got two dozen cases. What is that, news? We're always shorthanded here. Just a little tighter now than usual. It wasn't our fault, you know. What're you talking about? Diane. Did I say something? No. Well, all right then. How is she, sir? Have you heard anything? Yeah, she'll be out of the hospital this week. She coming back to work? No, she put in for a transfer. Another squad. She'll probably get it. The department heard that there was a personality conflict here. All right, come on. Let's get started. You know, I'm damn lucky. Why? How many people in this city do you know who are exactly what they want to be? Well, I am. Well, you. You're exceptional, Christine. So are you. Well, what can you do?
