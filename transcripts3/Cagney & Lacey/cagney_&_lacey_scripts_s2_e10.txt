 You should see the three of us working together. I mean, it's embarrassing. You try and pick up a bad guy, right, the two of them are holding hands. Are you crazy? You shouldn't have cocaine anywhere near a police station. Stop, or I'll blow your heads off! You're so much in control. I know the pressure you feel to be the perfect woman cop. You gotta perform. Don't play dumb with me. There's a reason that that man is on drugs. On drugs? Come on, we're not talking heroin.

 He's a sergeant. You know the department's attitude. He will be out of here in a hot New York minute. Thank you. You like it? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did. I thought you would. It's half Colombian, half Vienna Roast. Well, I should have known. There's this great place in Gramercy Park. Sells 75 different kinds of coffee. I'll take you there. Oh, what, is it like the great pasta place? You liked it. Oh, well. Hey, I mean, I respect a good con. Nine bucks for a plate of cold, green spaghetti. Are you kidding? I was ready to invest.

 Hey, it was written up in The New York Times. Oh, well, in The Times. You are so unhip. I'll take you to Eddie's, a rib joint in Harlem. That's hip. So, take me. I'd love to, but I gotta go to work. We're gonna be at least an hour early again. No wonder everybody knows about us. Well, you want to catch the best cases? Best cases. Like Mrs. Harrington, best cases? Now, that one's a cinch. It's a grounder, man. So how come your terrific Homicide Squad can't even prove it's a homicide? Didn't we have this argument before? I mean, like, during dinner, after the movie and all the way home. Just happen to think you guys are wrong, that's all. It's no defeat, you know, because we were called in on your case, just because you couldn't solve it. Defeat? We're talking about a 75-year-old woman who happened to have fallen down a flight of stairs. She was pushed. You have no motives, no evidence and no suspects. She was pushed, Chris. Leave it to the pros. I'll look forward to your findings. I'm always eager to learn. - You're learning. - So are you. PETRIE: Isn't she terrific? Really cute. Well, here. This one is for you. For me? Oh, no. I couldn't take your picture of your daughter. I've got more. Keeps you up at night, huh? Claudia's exhausted. But I don't seem to mind. Suddenly I've got all this energy. Well, you've got a daughter. You know what it's like. My daughter is 36 years old, lives with a guy who teaches aerobic dancing. Wanna know what that's like? - Good morning. - Good morning. - What, the master DD-5s are due today? - Yeah, it's almost the end of the month. - Jeez, already? - Yeah. We got 11 convictions out of 16 cases. That's not bad. That's damn good. So, did you just come in early to type this up? Oh, I just had a lot of energy this morning. Uh-huh. Oh, what is this, case 5378? Oh, Mrs. Harrington. Yeah, remember, the lady who fell down the stairs in the residential hotel. I thought we kicked this over to Homicide Squad. Well, we called them in to ask for their opinion. We certainly didn't kick it over to them. Well, it was more than an opinion, Chris. We were way over our heads. There's just too many factors here. I still wouldn't swear one way or another if it was an accident. So? So, just get it out of here. It's not our case. Technically, Mary Beth, we're still working together with the Homicide Squad on this... No. No. Wait, see, now we can truly say it's their case, and we got one less case. That means we got 11 convictions out of 15. That's even better. What's the matter? You don't want a better percentage? No. Sure I want a better percentage. It's just... I don't know, it's just such a fascinating case. You got a call from a Sergeant Dorian McKenna. I did? When? I don't know. I guess before you came in. Isn't that sweet? Isbecki, why didn't you tell me he called? Fascinating case. Wants to follow through. What am I, dumb or what? Excuse me, Victor. - I never liked Dorian McKenna. - CAGNEY: Yeah, give me Homicide. - Sure, he's a good cop, but... - He's a fine detective. Yeah, but he's a prima donna. I don't know what she sees in him. Nobody expects you to. If you don't mind my being crude, the boss is in the men's room. No, that's not crude. Well, you never know how you're gonna offend some broad these days. Oh, here he is. It's for you. Detective Cagney. Hello. Hi. What's up? DORIAN: I stopped by the coroner's office on the way in. There's a little contusion on the side of Mrs. Harrington's head they can't figure out. It could be from the fall or a blow to the skull. How do you like that? It's worth considering. Yeah, I thought so. So I'm going back to canvas the building. Okay. You have any suspects? No, I think it's random. - CAGNEY: You want any help? - No, I've got it. Oh. So, why'd you call? Well, are you free for a little coffee break? You know, half Vienna Roast, half Colombian? Coffee? Sure. How do you take it? Any way you like. Cream? Sugar? - If you're ordering out, get me a Danish. - I don't think so, sir. I gotta go. Later. Hi. You got a suicide over at 149, East 23rd Street. Take Lacey with you. What about me? Cagney signed in first, Cagney gets the case. She's on a roll today. He jumped from here. Name of the victim? A Meyer Riesman. White male, aged 60 or 70. He lived alone. That's about it for now. Okay. Thank you. Why would he keep his overcoat in the bathroom? I found this on the back of the door. I don't know. Maybe he forgot where he put it. - Senile, huh? - I don't know. Look at this. Oh, well, that's just old country. My grandmother used to keep fruit and stuff out there. She said it... Wait a minute. He's got a fridge in there with an icemaker and a freezer four times the size of mine. So, what do you think, he's crazy? Or lonely. Or both. This is no surprise to us and that is the damn shame of it. Why is it no surprise, Mr... George Poulianakis. And I am not afraid. Good for you, Mr... Sir. Good for me? Yeah, sure. I live here 17 years. I never seen nothing like this now. Like what? This used to be a nice building. Now we got busted mailbox, elevator broke. The heat, electricity go on and off in the middle of the night. Is this a rent controlled building, sir? How else could we live? Well, then, sir, you call the Building Department and you tell them precisely what's going on here. Oh, sure, sure, sure. They're going to stand in the hallways so young people don't write dirty things on the walls? They could stop punks from pounding on Meyer Riesman's door? And follow him home and threaten to hit him on the head? Now, who are these punks? Could you describe them to me? Please, girlie, I have to sit down. Oh, please. I remember, every Monday morning, the service would deliver this huge plastic bag of diapers, and damned if we didn't use every one of them. Disposable diapers are the answer, I'm telling you. Yeah. I'll bet. We tried cloth, too, thinking it'd be more natural, but paper ones really keep the baby drier. You know, the first time my son had diaper rash, I cried. I figured it hurt so much. I didn't know how to take away the hurt, you know. I know what you mean. That's between you and me. No problem. Cagney. Lacey. Come here. Sergeant McKenna's not so sure you got a suicide there. - Oh, no? - What're you doing on this case? Well, I heard about it and it sounded a lot like Mrs. Harrington, the lady who was killed in the residential hotel. Was she killed? The ME's office is leaning that way, Bert. I don't get it. What's similar? You have two old people living alone in rundown hotels. Both deaths could have been mistaken for accidents, although both victims were active and in good health. Well, we just got a neighbor... Excuse me, sir. Mr. George Poulia... P-O-U-L-I-A-N-A-K-I-S. He said that two men in their 20s were harassing Mr. Riesman. Do you think they shoved him out the window? Well, I sent a few guys out this afternoon and they found his daughter living in Queens. Her father just bought a little retirement place in the Poconos. They were gonna spend the summer together. - So he wasn't lonely. - Or crazy. He just bought season tickets for the New York City Ballet. - Does that sound like a suicide? - Then what was the motive? Any connection between these two people? Well, the best connection we have so far is that the hotel and the apartment building were two blocks apart. We can canvas the area. All right. I want you two to work with Sergeant McKenna. We got him on a steal from Homicide Squad, so make the most use of his time. Yes, sir. Thanks, Bert. You got it. - What about dinner? - Sure. How about Cuban-Chinese? Have a good time. Oh, I'm sorry. Why don't you come with us? No, the investigation's gonna be enough of a triple date as it is. - No, come on. We'll ask Harvey. - Yeah. Not for Cuban-Chinese. We'll take a rain check, huh? Okay. You're on. I wanna stop by the lab first, see what they got. Oh, they're not going to have anything yet. Yeah, but you get things faster when you sit on their head. You're going to a lab in Brooklyn in the middle of rush-hour traffic? You've got a lot of energy. The man loves his work. Well, have a good time, my children. I will see you tomorrow. Yeah. Want some? No. Are you crazy? You shouldn't have cocaine anywhere near a police station. Put it away. Well, I'll say it's evidence. Would you stop kidding around? You're on duty. Please, Dory, put it away. You're making me very uptight. Thank you. Shouldn't we check the relatives or the employment records of the victims first? - I wanna do it this way. - Okay. Mary Beth's just saying that there could be a connection between Mr. Riesman and Mrs. Harrington other than your theoretical homicide. - The connection is heat. - Heat? Both those buildings have been without heat this winter. Why did Mr. Riesman wear his overcoat indoors? Why did he keep food out on the windowsill? No electricity. But that's a nice building. Yeah, I think what Dory's saying is that the building's just on its way down. According to the tenants, things started to deteriorate during the last two years. That happens a lot when you change owners. I think we're getting ahead of ourselves here. No, I think Dory just means... He can speak for himself. Chris, look, why don't you let me speak for myself? Okay. Excuse me. I'm going to the men's room. Miss Hickey's on her lunch hour. She said come back about 3:00. 3:00? Where's she having lunch, Connecticut? She has to go to her doctor. Can anybody else help us? Nope. Do you know we could charge you with obstruction? Would it get me off work? Nobody's allowed in here. Let's go, smart mouth. I can't start going through all that information. I'm on my break in 10 minutes. Well, then you've got 10 minutes to find it. Go. CAGNEY: The guy's got buildings in everybody's name but his own. In his wife's, his son's. Anyway, the bottom line is, the hotel and the apartment house where the two people died are both owned by one man. A Leonard F. Nolan. We found over 300 outstanding housing violations and $43,000 in unpaid fines. So, what does the guy do? Walk? He hires a P.R. firm and a good lawyer. He's never made any of his court dates. In the meantime, he's just destroying his own buildings. Co-op conversions? - Yeah. - Seems to be. He's got a lot of ways of forcing tenants out. Broken mailboxes, withholding heat, etcetera, etcetera. Yeah. They move, he claims lack of occupancy. He turns them into co-ops and he makes a fortune. So, where is this crumb? LACEY: The Bahamas, sir. That's what the P.R. man said. Get on a plane, go down to the Bahamas and bring him back. Just kidding. - I knew it. - How could you tell? Listen, Victor. If you don't want it, I'll just take it back. It's okay. - Want what? - The picture I gave you the other day. Oh, Marvin Oszelewski? Lauren. My daughter, Lauren. Oh, your daughter, Lauren. Yeah. I was just... I was just gonna have that... - I was gonna have that framed. - You don't have to do that. It's amazing, but she's already changed since we took that picture. I've got two more rolls developing right now. That's great. (PHONE RINGS) Paul La Guardia. 14th Squad. Oh, yes. Yes, I'll get her for you. Just hold on. Lacey. For you, on three. Detective Lacey. Yes, Mrs. Skimmins. Thank you so much for coming. I didn't know who else to call. I've kept the oven on, but still it's 49 degrees in here. May I use your telephone, please, Mrs. Skimmins? Certainly. And the electricity went off again last night. Now, fortunately, I didn't have too much in the freezer, but... Does this happen a lot? Oh, all the time, and it's mostly senior citizens living here, like Mr. Poulianakis. Mr. Poulianakis. Is that the gentleman I met the other day in the hall? Yes. Now, I am really very concerned about him. What's the problem? Every Tuesday, we go to the public library. But yesterday, I knocked on his door and he didn't answer. I called. The phone rings, but he doesn't answer that either. - Does he have a wife? - No, his wife died. Mr. Robbins, this is Detective Lacey, 14th Squad. - So, I think he's just alone in there. - We need some help here - at 146, East 23rd Street. - I'm really very worried about him. I think something must have happened to him. Could you show us his apartment, please? Well, whatever you could do, sir. I know that my Lieutenant would be very grateful. Thank you. Thank you, sir. - They're checking into an emergency crew. - Bless you. - Mary Beth. - Mr. Poulianakis' room is right over here. What? Mr. Poulianakis! We're the police. We'd like to help you. Are you inside? It's not like him at all. - He's in there. - Yeah, he is. - Where's your fire hose? - Right here. Sir? We're coming, just hang on! It's Detective Lacey from the other day, and just... We're coming, all right? - Okay. Okay. - Back up. Back up. Mrs. Skimmins, just hold this and stand clear, all right? Please get back there. Yeah. Sir, we're gonna break your door in now, so just don't be afraid! Mary Beth, would you back up already! Give me one more hit. - Oh, my God. - CAGNEY: Good Lord, it's freezing in here. Oh, you don't know what they did to me. Hoodlums. It was snowing outside, you know. - My wife with the baby. - He's dehydrated. Mrs. Skimmins, will you get as many blankets as you can find, please? Please. I need drink. It's all right, Mr. Poulianakis. You'll be fine. - Mary Beth, he's so cold. - Just easy, now, easy. Who did this to you? Who were they? I could not go nowheres. I could not call. He took my walker. They took his walker. CAGNEY: Get an ambulance over to 149, East 23rd Street, apartment 504. (PHONE RINGS) - Hello. - DORIAN: Did I wake you up? Hi. No, you didn't wake me up. Why do I always say that when people call me in the middle of the night? Of course, you woke me up. I just wanted to ask you a question. - CAGNEY: Ask. - Are you alone? Hold on a minute. I'll put him on. Harry, come here, sweetheart. You're really cooking for 2:00 in the morning. Yeah, so are you. What's the sudden paranoia? No, no, no, no, I just... I just didn't want you to forget about me. Dory, you got nothing to worry about, okay? - Where are you? - I'm in the corner... I'm in a... I... I'm in a phone booth on the corner of 23rd and Lex. - I'm freezing my buns off, by the way. - Why? I couldn't sleep and it's the first of the month and there's a chance that Nolan's thugs may come around to collect the rent and maybe bust up the boiler again. You're really onto this guy, aren't you? It's no big deal. I don't like the idea of you being out there all by yourself. Yeah. That's what my ex-wife used to say. And she didn't even know the half of it. Right? Listen. Why don't you come over here and be with me? I'm all right, sweetheart, really. Why don't you go back to sleep? I... I just get a little crazy sometimes. That's okay. All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye. - Good night. - Harry, come here! Mr. Nolan's on vacation in Honolulu. We heard the Bahamas. I should know where he is. I'm his mother. Well, then you know about his buildings. He talks to me sometimes. Here I just answer the phone. Did you know that two of your son's tenants died the past 10 days, and the third, he's in the hospital in grave condition? Lots of people drop dead every day in this city. A Mr. Meyer Riesman, a Mrs. Jane Harrington. They give you any particular problem? I could look up and see if they've been paying their rents. Please do. These tenants today. It's not like years ago. They bring cockroaches, let their kids make noise in the halls. Both of these people were elderly and lived alone. Now those, I feel sorry for. They're the victims. I got nothing out of the ordinary on those names. Isn't this a dangerous job for you girls? Let's get out a warrant for Nolan. I'd love to, but for what? A chat? We've gotta come up with something better than that. How about criminal rottenness? Look, I'm not gonna go back with you. I gotta go home and change. - For what? - I've got a date. - Someplace nice? - He said he'd take me out to dinner. Lucky you. - I love this job. - Oh, you really do, don't you? - Look at us, fighting the bad guys. - That's what it's all about. Yeah. That and getting promoted. Don't worry about that. You got what's called the right stuff, just like I do. I'm so glad you think so. Samuels respects your work. So do I. Thank you. Do you have a tissue or something? Yeah. In my coat, in the back. You know how long I've been in this car? It's going on 65 hours. - This keeps you awake? - Yeah. It's a lot like caffeine. But a lot more fun than coffee. Hey, frankly, I think that cocaine's overrated, I mean, the way I use it. It's really very subtle. I mean, do I look like a raving maniac or a record producer to you? It's turning you into a record producer? Now, I'm really worried. Are you? I mean, it's no big deal unless you abuse it. Which you don't. What, do you think I'm a doofus, huh? It just makes you concentrate. I mean, it makes your mind more alert, you know? At least, you think so, huh? Come on, baby. This is it. - Hold it. Hold it, police! Hold it. - Hold it right there. Go, go. - Get to the car and call for backup. - All right. This is detective car 872. (SIRENS BLARING) Stop, or I'll blow your heads off! Freeze! Out! Keep your hands up. Against the car. - MAN: All right. - Spread! Spread! - All right, man. - Further! - Out of the car, kid! Move it! - Out of the car! Close that door! Spread! Spread your legs! Out! Who paid you to bust up that boiler? You have the right to remain silent. Nobody, it was our own idea. - Where'd you get it? - We got it from watching TV. Watch your mouth, you're in deep and it's gonna get deeper. We gotta call our lawyer. - You call him. - Come on, man. Take it easy. Frisk them and cuff them. - Dory, you don't look so good. - I'm fine, thank you. That was absolutely nuts what you did. But we got him, didn't we? Hey, Tommy. Hey. Do yourselves a favor, give this guy up. We know that Nolan paid you to do it. Nobody paid us a cent. Just your own natural creativity, right? You must think an awful lot of Mr. Nolan to protect him like this. DORIAN: Oh, they don't think at all. We ain't as stupid as you. - You got two seconds... - Dory, come on. - Two seconds to apologize. - Hey, Dory, come on. Apologize, you stinking little punk. - Come on, apologize! - Dory, come on! He apologizes. This is Mr. Russell. He represents Leonard Nolan. Oh, yes. How is Mr. Nolan? Still enjoying the sun in the Bahamas? Or is it Hawaii? My client called me this morning and asked me to intercede. Fine. These two were caught trespassing and damaging a boiler. Yes, but Mr. Nolan has decided not to press charges. Oh, smart cookie. Mr. Nolan feels this act of vandalism was performed by two unfortunate victims of society who, due to unemployment and a lack of education, had no alternative but to vent their anger on someone else's property. He wants to give them another chance. He also doesn't want them testifying against him. So, can we go or what? Well, Mr. Nolan is the complainant, right? And if he doesn't want to press charges, what have we got to hold them on? - Resisting arrest. - That'll do. Good bye, Mr. Russell. Dory's got a great idea. We haul Nolan up in front of the grand jury, force him to explain why he will not press charges against those punks, and hopefully, he will perjure himself. Is that a gutsy move? Yeah. How're you gonna get him in? Petrie and Isbecki are gonna do a nail and serve. Dory seems to be in kind of a bad mood. You two still wanna come to dinner? Oh, yeah. Oh, come on. We're looking forward to it. He may be a little hung over. He did a little coke last night. - Cocaine? - Yeah. Just a minute. Well, he was up for 72 hours on that stakeout. Did he tell you that he was using cocaine? After I got there, yeah. I didn't hear any of this, Chris. And you better not tell anybody else, either. Hey, I didn't say I was using it. Mary Beth, look, he just uses it for recreational purposes. Christine, don't play dumb with me. There's a reason that that man is on drugs. On drugs? Come on, we're not talking heroin. He's a sergeant. You know the department's attitude. He will be out of here in a hot New York minute. Yeah. Well, I'm not so sure that there isn't more drug abuse going on than the department would like to know about frankly. Aren't you the one who was ready to write off her father because he took payoffs on his beat 30 years ago? And all of a sudden, it's okay with you that cops who are supposed to uphold the law are taking illegal drugs. I didn't say that. Oh, I see. Dory's the exception. How come you're being so hard on me? If you were ever caught in a car with him with that stuff, they could have you for presumed possession, you know that. I hope you use your head about this. I'm really sorry I ever mentioned it at all. So am I. Think Mr. Nolan'll miss this warrant? It's a pretty nice neighborhood for a scuzzball. Yeah. It's a great place for children. Claudia says that when you give Lauren a rattle now, she looks up and smiles. I'm sorry if I'm boring you. No. I love kids. I told you that. I might not love hearing about them all the time, that's all. It's lousy working all day, not being there while your child's growing up. Lauren does all these terrific things and I hear them second hand from Claudia. You know, I get up at 5:00 in the morning just to play with my baby. I never knew fathers could feel that way. I'll shut up. That's okay. You must get tired of hearing me talk about whatever I talk about. Yourself. Yeah, but who could blame me? The kids made dessert. Is that why there's a bite missing? I tell you, no. There were two guys from my high school that made it to the pro ranks and I know that there was one from yours. You don't remember his name? He was a defensive line. He played... Chicken smells great, hon. Well, I hope so. Are you guys hungry? Yeah, I'm utterly starving. Oh, well, then we'll speed it up here. Hey, Mary Beth, please take it easy. I mean it's only us slobs. - Hey, speak for yourself. - I beg your pardon. Why don't you relax? I mean you've been on your feet all day. Have a drink. - I mean, this'll take care of itself. - This? How? - I'll do it. - Yeah, yeah. We'll do it. You girls sit down. - All right? All right? - What? Why don't you put your feet up on the chair? - Very nice. - Take your shoes off. Here we go. - Is that the way he treats you? - This is the way I treat him. Hey, Harvey, where's the john? - Through there on the right. - All right. Excuse me. Isn't that beautiful? Hey, I think you've got yourself a real swell fellow there, Christine. Yeah. - He's sweet, isn't he? - HARVEY: Oh, yeah. Now what is sweet? Sweet is going to the drugstore for tampons when you've got cramps. Oh, what a thing to say. - Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. I do that. - Do you? - Yeah. - Well, you're sweet, too. I would say so. You should see the three of us working together. I mean, it's embarrassing. You try and pick up a bad guy, right, the two of them are holding hands. This is not true. The woman opens her face, lies pour out. It is not true. Hey, it's gonna be a while, Dory. This ought to hold you. Oh, no thanks. Not for me. - I thought you were starving. - Oh, did I say that? No, really, I can wait. But, look, let me make the dressing, huh? Do I do great things with garlic. You got any fresh? And, also, I need some oregano. - Hey, you got a cold? - Oregano's right over here. No, no, it's just the steam heat, you know. It dries me out. You are going to love this. - Wait a minute. Park it over there. - Yeah, sure. You should keep a pot of water on the radiator. Yeah, pots. Look, I got pots all over the apartment, you know. Then I look around, I got nothing to cook with. The whole trick of these little devils is... Honey, you want me to help you set the table? Yes. Excuse us, huh? Now, how're you doing, baby? Yeah. Now, the whole trick of this is to just try to get the little garlics out without wounding them. It's a little, tiny, delicate operation that must be performed here, which I learned in the Catskill Mountains from a friend of mine. His name was Larry. LACEY: Honey, I can't... HARVEY: Hey! I know what that guy was doing in this bathroom and so do you. So what's the story, huh? Honey, I didn't know he was gonna do it here. You mean, he takes that stuff while he works? - I don't know for sure. - Oh, you don't know for sure. You mean, he only does it here in our house, with the kids asleep in the next room. I did coke before I met you, Chris, long before, so don't take it so damn personally. Well, how can you just toot up like that in Mary Beth's house? I told you how she felt about it. It's like peanuts. If it's there, it's hard to resist. - Well, can't you stop? - I never thought about it. How much do you take anyway? I don't know, maybe a quarter, maybe a half. It's nothing I can't handle. Oh, sure, but enough that you gotta have Valium to come down from it. Why do you need it? I don't need it. I just don't like to be without it, that's all. I thought you were so much in control. That's because you're so much in control. I know the pressure you feel to be the perfect woman cop. - You gotta perform, right? - Pretty close. Yeah. Well, for an unfeeling coke-head, I've got your number, don't I? Yeah, maybe. Sometimes. So, what, coke makes you numb, huh? I mean, your mind works faster, but, emotionally, you feel nothing. Yeah, it's an anesthetic. It cools you out. You really want it to be like that, don't you? Even between us. Like what? Cold. Clean as ice. I can't tell her what to do. She cares very much for him. I care very much for you. I do not want you working with this guy. His judgment is obviously off and it makes me wonder about Chris, too. - Honey, I can't set my own... - Hey, this is not a discussion. Get your priorities straight, huh? - Honey... - End of subject. I'm sorry, Harv. Where's Sergeant McKenna? His line's been busy all morning. - Well, try him at home. - That's where I have been trying. Oh, okay. Well, let's go without him. Our lawyer says he'll have us out of here by tomorrow. - I wouldn't pack my bags. - Both of youse have priors. So, what else is new? Hey, you punk, you ever heard of the persistent felon program? Two felonies and you qualify. And the current sentence is a minimum of 25 years to life. I only have one felony conviction. You can look that up on my record. We already have done that, Mr. Nunzio, and you're quite right. But you did break that boiler over at 149, East 23rd Street. We didn't hurt it. You did at least $250 of damages, wouldn't you say, Detective Cagney? Oh, at least. Yeah. So that's at least a Class E felony. This is police brutality. I think you guys ought to call your lawyer again. Either that or you got another choice. - You tell us about Nolan. - What about him? Did he pay you to vandalize his property? To terrorize his tenants? Or would you rather take the fall for murder? Nolan paid us 50 bucks. For what? To hurt the old man, take his walker? What old man? We never hurt nobody. Whatever went down, Nolan did that himself. He said he was better with people. So we just did some little jobs for him, that's it. I'm gonna go pick up Dory... Sergeant McKenna. If Mary Beth calls, would you tell her to meet me at the Nolan house? SAMUELS: Well, take backup. Wasn't Isbecki and Petrie on the case? LA GUARDIA: They're over on the sweater factory arson. Yeah, there are three of us. It's okay. La Guardia, can I use your car? I've never met Mr. Nolan. I've never even seen him. Now you tell me he's carrying a shotgun. That's the way Mr. Poulianakis described him. I'm alone here. I really can't get involved. Mrs. Skimmins, we can protect you. I've never seen anything out of the ordinary. I really must be going. Mr. Poulianakis is getting out of the hospital today. That's good. Thank you. The heat still on? Yes, thank you. It is. (PHONE RINGS) La Guardia. Detectives. 14th Squad. No, she's just left. She went to Nolan's? Yeah. Give me the address. Don't tell me we finally got something on him. I suggest you drop the gun, sir. 'Cause he's... Chris, just... Chris! I've got him. Go around the other way. (EXCLAIMS) - What're you doing? - Leave him alone. Why? Who was he? Did I make a mistake? No, no, you did the right thing. - But he was holding a gun on you. - Look, it was all right. I'm sorry. I thought he was one of Nolan's men. No, it's just somebody I owe money to. No. No. Somebody could have gotten hurt out there, Dory. An innocent bystander. Anybody. Would you take it easy? It was just bad luck you came along when you did. Damn it. I can't take this anymore. (EXCLAIMS) You know what'd have happened if he'd have found out I was a cop? Damn you! This is detective car 12, have you got a message for me from Detectives Cagney or McKenna? Are they on their way? WOMAN ON RADIO: No message, car 12. Do you require backup? Negative. I think. - Leonard F. Nolan? - Who wants to know? Detective Lacey, 14th. How are you, sir? I've been better. How are you? Fine. We posted a warrant on your door the other day. Did you see that? - I tore it up. - Did you? Oh, that's disrespectful, sir. That costs the taxpayers' money to send two detectives out here... Lady, I got so many warrants and fines and who knows what else, I could plaster a room. - That's harassment, that's what it is. - Oh, no, sir. I've been dealing with the city of New York 12 years. No, this warrant isn't about your property, sir. It concerns a homicide investigation. Oh, then you definitely got the wrong guy. I'm not here to pass judgment. I don't know whether I got the right guy or not. I'm just doing my job. So? Can I give you some advice? Come down to the precinct, straighten the whole thing out. - You got a lawyer? - Of course, I got a lawyer. Well, then, no problem, no sweat. You call him. He'll take care of it, I'm sure. I mean, that's what lawyers get paid for, isn't it? I gotta be somewhere. Mr. Nolan, you know how these things drag on and on. Let's get it over with, huh? You got to, sooner or later. Come on, I'll drive. Isn't this a nice house? We live in an apartment. It's so nice having all this room, isn't it? But it's a big commute into the city. It must get bad in sloppy weather, huh? You could take the train, I guess. Oh, watch your step here. We would have a private home if we could afford it. But the interest rates have been so crazy recently. I mean, we just never have the price for a down payment. I lived in an apartment all my life. All my life. To tell you the truth, I don't know what I'd do with all this room. Sit down. I got a girlfriend. Believe it or not, she won't go 15 miles outside the city 'cause she says she can't stand the silence, would you believe that? Listen. Could you help me going out of here, 'cause I got a little confused on the roads? Put that in the back and put your seatbelt on. I don't want to lose you. You have no evidence against my client. We have statements signed by two young men who were hired by Mr. Nolan to willfully damage his property. Who? Those two lousy punks? Street hustlers? You're going to believe them? Punks, huh? That's funny. Last time you called them victims of society. Isn't that right, Mr. Nolan? - Let me just recap this... - Mr. Poulianakis... Christine. Mr. Poulianakis, do you know who that man is? - Just take your time, sir. - Would you please... Is he the one that you described to us? Yes. He is the one who took my walker. - Are you sure? - Don't push. I'm sure. Okay, and you're willing to testify? Mrs. Lacey already explained that to me. Well, I just wanted you to understand... He understands. MR. POULIANAKIS: I hope you lock him away good. Well, murder, attempted murder, reckless endangerment. Don't worry. He's in a lot of trouble. Thank you for your help, Mrs. Skimmins. Now, he's going to say something perfectly awful in Greek. (SPEAKING IN GREEK) Good for you. Dory! She's furious with me and she's right. We blew the collar. We weren't there for backup. Sure she's right. We both acted like a couple of jerks. - We? - Sweetheart, you walked into a situation with me in the car that you did not understand. And you blew it entirely out of proportion. Really, I had it under control. Control? Who are you kidding? Dory, when's this gonna stop? What are you gonna do, change my life? But you're hooked or dependant or whatever it is you call it. Chris, without cocaine, I couldn't do what I do, okay? I couldn't work as long. I couldn't work as hard. It makes me a better cop. If you really believe that, Dory, you need help. For me, it just gives me a little push, okay? If you don't get help, I'm gonna turn you in. Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Think about what you're saying. And who you're saying it to. It's like holding a loaded gun to my belly. I don't want to be the one holding the gun. I don't! Then don't. Leave it alone. I'm gonna turn you in. I'm not worth all this to you. If I had nothing else to do with the rest of my life, I'd try to convince you just how worthy you are. But as it turns out, I got a couple of things pending. (CRYING) Christine. I was wondering if we got the new towels in. Towels? I don't know. Yeah. We were out and I ordered some that were softer. I've been meaning to bring some hand lotion from home. Yeah, the weather's... It's really hard on your hands. I know. This should really break their heart and paint this place. Well, maybe one weekend, we'll come in, we'll paint it. Maybe not. Come here.
