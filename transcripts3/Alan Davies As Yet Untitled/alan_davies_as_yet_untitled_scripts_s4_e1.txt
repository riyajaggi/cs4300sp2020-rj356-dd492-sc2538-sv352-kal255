 {\an5}ALAN DAVIES AS YET UNTITLED 01 CTO N219D/82 BF000000 Give me a letter and I'll kill you. Oh, hello. I've got a summons for a Mr A Davies. I'm the show's token non-national treasure, so it should be good. Hi! I'm getting myself ready for a nice chat. {\an1}APPLAUSE Hello. I'm Alan Davies. Welcome to my show. {\an5}This is As Yet Untitled, the show without any agendas or topics or lists of things to say or intro. But we do have some guests who are going to help me {\an5}come up with a title for the show by the end of the evening - its sole ambition. So please will you welcome my guests.

 {\an1}CHEERING Here they are! Welcome, all of you. Thank you for coming. So we have Alex Edelman here. {\an5}Alex Edelman was THAT far from punching President Obama in the face. Alex Edelman. {\an1}CHEERING Sandi Toksvig. Welcome to Sandi. Sandi Toksvig isn't as posh as you might think and just isn't very good with faces. Sandi Toksvig. {\an1}CHEERING Stephen Fry. Welcome, Stephen. Stephen Fry is often distracted by neighbours popping in and has his own take on Blur versus Oasis.

 {\an1}CHEERING And Sara Pascoe. Sara Pascoe is bad at speeding and has a confession about tickles. I'm delighted to have you. This is the first time ever I've had a pen. So this is a new development. Because we're trying to find a title for the show and I can never remember any of the remarkably good ideas that come up. So now it's my job to remember to write them down. {\an5}So, actually, it's two things to remember. It's going to make it more difficult for me. How are you, Alex? Good. What's that? This is an Old Fashioned. What's in that? Whisky and shit. It's so funny. If you say it like that, it's fine. But if you said, "Whisky and shit"... Bleurgh! But "Whisky and shit" is fine. "Whisky and shit" - terrible. That's a very different... That's a much more old-fashioned drink. I had a Blow Job once. I beg your pardon? Which was... It's a shot... Like a sort of a brown... Looks like Baileys. {\an5}And there's some squirted cream on top, and the idea is you drink it without using your hands. It's like a Buttery Nipple... You just go... I just remembered the worst blow job I ever had. It was fantastic! How did we get here so quickly? Sorry about that! {\an5}I thought within 15 minutes, but seriously, this is a land speed record! {\an5}I used to work in a cocktail bar and how immature people are about the names gets dull really quickly. Because to you every day, they're just words. A Long Slow Comfortable Screw Up Against The Wall is one. Sex On The Beach. This kind of thing. People asking and they think it's really funny. I work in a bar. My wife used to work in a bar. A guy came in and without looking at her said, "JD and Coke, four of." "Four of?" Yes. Where was the bar - Essex? Somewhere in the City. It was in the City, was it? Was he wearing a pink shirt? I hate those guys. Already I hate him. I hate him as well. {\an5}I tell this story to other people so they will hate him. I don't know who he is. Who goes around saying, "JD and Coke, four of"? We must hunt him ruthlessly down. Someone at home will know who you're talking about. How long did you work in a cocktail bar? Well, I got sacked, actually. Cos I was giving away free drinks to my cousin. Apparently...that's theft. Was it actually your cousin? Yeah. Just if you'd lied as well... Just a stranger! It's just a relative! {\an5}Were you actually a cocktail waitress? Do you know how to do a John Collins? {\an5}They trained you, so we had to go away on coaches to other bars and be taught. No-one wants someone to make them a cocktail after looking at a menu and going, "OK, yeah. Half of that. Hang on! Hang on. "Has anyone seen the peach schnapps?" Best cocktail recipe ever is Noel Coward's recipe for a martini. {\an5}You pour a large amount of gin in a glass and you wave it in the general direction of Italy. This is name-dropping of the worst kind, but the Prince of Wales, as far as I know, has one joke, which he tells. AS PRINCE CHARLES: If you're flying over the South Pacific or something, {\an5}you're likely to be downed on a desert island, so always make sure whenever you travel you have a hip flask and a small bottle of olives and some gin and some vermouth. {\an5}So when you land on this island, your plane breaks down, you're alone, all alone. And if you just stand in a jungle clearing and you start to make yourself a martini, {\an5}you can guarantee, within seconds, someone will jump out of a tree and say, "That's not the proper way to make a martini!" {\an1}APPLAUSE {\an5}So, Alex...it's very difficult not to begin with you and President Obama. I love President Obama. I now feel like I need to say that! I was working for a baseball team in Los Angeles... As a baseball player? No. {\an5}I was working in public relations, but a just as essential part of the team. Did you have to get in the showers with them afterwards? No, we weren't that lucky. {\an5}One day they said, "You can't leave during lunch. Just so everybody knows." I was like, "What?!" {\an5}"You can't leave because Marine 1 is landing in the parking lot. Security's locked down the stadium." And, um...so of course, so I walked out to see the President land. {\an5}And he lands and they say, "There'll be a receiving line when he comes back." And the problem is, I really... I have, um, intrusive thoughts, like a lot of normal people. {\an5}Like, if I'm on a train platform and the train starts to come, the voice in the back of your headis like, "Don't jump!" It's like, "Why would I jump?" {\an5}That's everybody. Apparently, it's monkey brain, in terms of your primate brain, which is used to you jumping from thing to thing. {\an5}When you're somewhere high or there's a gap, your brain is going, "Do you reckon you can do it?" So that is everyone. {\an5}But do most people have this when the President's coming down a receiving line? {\an5}That part of my brain was like, "When he gets to you, don't punch him in the face." And I was like... It's super weird to begin with, cos receiving lines are so artificial. {\an5}You wait behind a velvet rope and the dignitary comes down and shakes... It's like a reverse Madame Tussauds. And I'm standing next to the girl I was seeing at the time, and that voice is like, "Don't punch him." {\an5}I'm like, "I'm not gonna punch him. Let's make a list - pros and cons of punching." I'm so nervous, I'm actually saying to myself, "Don't punch him!" And my girlfriend just sees my face and goes, "Alex, don't do anything crazy." And I go, "Why would I do anything crazy?" And he gets to me... Security's like that... But I was just terrified, and he gets to me and she's like... She knows something. She cleared out to make room for the snipers. And... {\an1}ALL TALK AT ONCE He puts out his hand and he goes, "Wow! Firm handshake." And like a lunatic, I just went, "You have no idea." Oh, my! Magnificent! No, it's awful. But why would it occur to you to...? Just because... {\an5}Have you never been at a wedding and had to stop yourself from shouting out, "Titty, titty, titty!" Or something like that? No? {\an5}No. I just want to see how badly you can screw things up for yourself. When John Bayley married Iris Murdoch, they were going down the aisle in Christ Church, Oxford, {\an5}and a don called across the aisle to a friend in the loudest whisper anybody ever heard, "Of course you know I've had them both?" {\an5}I fell very deeply in love with him and decided {\an5}to win him into loving me by pretending I was also gay. Stephen, the neighbours popping in. {\an5}Yes, this is... Well, it's name-dropping of the worst kind again. But I have a house in Norfolk and had a houseful, that particular winter, of guests, friends. Not a euphemism? No. And I was one morning making eggs benedict, {\an5}a thing I pride myself on. The hollandaise takes a bit of concentration. The phone rang, so I pick it up rather testily. "Yes? What?" AS PRINCE CHARLES: "Can I speak to Stephen Fry, please?" "Yes, this is he. What, who, what?" "This is the Prince of Wales." And this little creature in my head sent a message to my lips to say, "Oh, fuck off, Rory!" Oh, no! No! {\an5}It's a very strange thing when it is the real person. However good an impressionist you may know, something tells you that IS the real person. {\an5}So another part of my brain sent a message to overtake the first message, "Hello, sir. How nice to hear from you." He said, "I thought I might come for tea." "Oh...well, lovely, yes, absolutely. Did you have a day in mind?" "Yes, New Year's Day." So that was sort of sorted. Went to the hallway and shouted up the stairs, a bit like Rik in The Young Ones, "House meeting!" And, er...er... {\an5}People sort of doing up dressing gowns appeared at the top of the stairs and said, "What?" {\an5}I said, "The Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, is coming for tea on New Year's Day." "So the lot of you can ... off!" They all went, "Oh, bollocks!" They didn't believe me at all, of course. {\an5}And it wasn't until a green Range Rover with a couple of figures in tweed jackets and a lot of dogs... They checked out the place was secure. By this time, everybody believed he was coming. {\an5}And then... Well, I wish you could have seen Rowan Atkinson vacuuming the carpet. Looking like Freddie Mercury in I Want To Break Free! Desperately tidying up, {\an5}and then Hugh Laurie took a photograph of him, because it was just so hilarious. He was very tidy. Everybody else started tidying. All of us quite progressive, bien pensant figures, who don't necessarily buy into the whole British establishment thing, getting all excited. Childish of us, but we did. To cut a long story short, after Rowan had come back... {\an5}I think he'd gone to a garage, which was the only thing open on New Year's Day. ..and got a box of fig rolls. Fortunately, I had got cakes and tea and buns and honey and things. So the doorbell goes and everybody skedaddled like cowards. Um...and I opened the door and he gave the immortal lines, "I hope you don't mind - I brought my wife." Princess Diana stepped forward, {\an5}looking at me under her lashes in that way that she had like nobody else. "Hello, Stephen." And, um... Went in, like that. {\an5}My friend Hugh Laurie was there with his son Charlie, who was about two years old, I think. He was pottering around, being very well-behaved. Everybody else was kind of on their best behaviour. They became relaxed and very good fun. But Charlie went up and turned the television on, as children often do. His mother shouted, "Charlie!" The Prince of Wales went, "What, what, what?" {\an5}But it was pretty good. When they left, I remember she looked at me and said, "I'm sorry we're leaving early, "but it's Spitting Image tonight." She said, "They hate it. "I LOVE it!" {\an5}And there you have her in a nutshell. By saying that to me, she was putting me in her power, really. Putting herself in my power, rather, because I could have called up any newspaper and said, "Princess Di likes Spitting Image," {\an5}who were at the time hated by a lot of people for making fun of the Royal Family. So she kind of makes you her slave. Anyway, it was very extraordinary. Amazing! Imagine Rowan Atkinson going to the garage! "What you got fit for...?" I can't imagine him hoovering without it being like Mr Bean. {\an1}HE MUMBLES LIKE BEAN Have you always been able to mimic? Were you able to mimic as a child? Yes, I did schoolteachers and things. Yes, the classic way, I suppose. But over the years, the list of people you can do is really... Oh, thank you! It's amazing. What is it you pick on? Is it a quirk? Is it a...? I don't really consciously... I think it's in conversation when I'm being someone, the voice patterns will take over, or they won't. If they do, I suppose... Who does you best? Hugh actually does me very well. Does he? He does, annoyingly. He can't do anyone else! I bet you're being modest. I bet you can do pretty much anyone. {\an5}I remember I met Stephen once before and I asked what your blind spot was. Like, your knowledge blind spot. Do you remember what you said? No. You said, "The songs of R Kelly." So, between Stephen Fry and myself, we know everything. You know all of R Kelly's songs? I'm pretty well-versed in R Kelly. Can I ask a question? Who is R Kelly? He's an R&B;, um... He's an R&B; singer. I think there's some words which should go in front of "R&B; singer". Very out of fashion now... How dare you?! R&B; singer? Also, he got in lots of trouble for... Let's separate the man from the music! The things famous men get in trouble for, he got in trouble for that. He said, "JD and Coke, four of." That's finished it! Now, Sara, bad at speeding? Speeding as in driving your car? I feel awkward with this story now following the story that's just happened. You will find out why when this story finishes. OK. {\an5}When I was 14, I was very naughty, and my mum was out of the house with her boyfriend, David, and I had a party. I hadn't wanted one. A friend of mine said I should have a party, {\an5}because there was this boy and I wanted to kiss him and I hadn't kissed a boy yet. So this was her masterplan that I'd get to kiss him. {\an5}So she invited everyone from school. Everyone from school hated me and they trashed my house. {\an5}That's the back-story. So my punishment was I had to join this local drama club in the church hall. {\an5}So I went to this drama club and it was the best thing that ever happened to me {\an5}because I met people outside of school. I found people with interests. {\an5}There was a guy who played piano there and his name was Simon. He was 37 and he was a homosexual. {\an5}I fell very deeply in love with him and decided to win him into loving me by pretending I was also gay. And so, um... Wait - I've spotted a flaw. No, hang on. So my plan was I would now get to talk to him about it and he'll help me come out and accidentally fall in love with me. I was very young. So, er... There's still time. Yeah, I'm playing the long game... if you're watching. So, um...he was a very kindly man {\an5}and so one of the things that he did to help me to come out is take me gay clubbing. So that's where I would meet my women. And I... Then when we got to this... I knew I'd seen you before. And so when we got there... Everyone was much older than me. So then they got out speed in little wraps, to do in the queue before going into this gay club. {\an5}And I was so busy about pretending to be gay that I thought this was just part of it. So they said, "Just put it on your gums," and I did. {\an5}So I was 16 years old, in a gay club. They all left me - they were all doing other things. I'd never been on my own before. I remember dancing on my own at the top of a stairwell and kind of going, "You know what? It's gonna be OK, actually." {\an5}I spent my whole life feeling very physically constrained and very embarrassed and ashamed of myself. Suddenly, no-one cared how I was dancing. I was invisible and I was among other people. And also, I was coming up on... It wasn't necessarily the drugs, {\an5}but humanity and the future of being an adult. I was really starting to get into my dance moves when the DJ turned the music down and put the lights up and said, "Look, everybody. Look at that girl. "She's dancing like something out of Jurassic Park." What?! Yes. And then the music... And I don't know if it was the embarrassment or the narcotics, but I started having a nosebleed. So I had to go home. I couldn't wait for these people. But when I got home, I couldn't sleep, because I was too awake, so I spent 45 minutes writing a really scribbled diary entry with all my thoughts and feelings for the future. And so I'd probably been in bed... I don't think I went to bed - I think it was on the sofa. {\an5}..for about 10 minutes, 15 minutes. I was just about to go into deep sleep when my mum woke me up. She was screaming and crying. She was distraught. She was saying, "Princess Diana has died!" And so can you see why I thought it was my fault? I always felt there was something I could have done. And so I never took drugs again. Ever? No, never. Wow! Because that was such... A tale to enlighten. It was like the world was saying to me, "Bad things will happen." It was like I was being punished for something. Such a warning. Oh, wow! When Princess Diana died, I was like... I was a child, and we went to some wedding in Connecticut and my mother, uh...my mother loved Princess Diana. {\an5}She's not a celebrity person, but she loved Princess Diana. I remember walking into the hotel room and I had dropped cake on, uh... I dropped cake at the wedding. Is that a drug thing? Really good presumption! {\an5}I dropped some wedding cake and I had swept it under the table with my foot. Of course. {\an5}I walked back in the hotel and my mother was crying and I thought, "She knows." But... ..she explained what had happened and I was so relieved, I went... I was a child, so I had no tact. "You didn't even know her!" My mother went, "Go to your room!" I was doing News Quiz that week on Radio 4. {\an5}I remember we were told, strictly speaking, not to mention it. There was nothing else in the news! {\an5}So we were trying our best with stories nobody had heard anything about. This is a programme about making jokes about current affairs. And so the great Linda Smith, one of the funniest women of all time, said, "Can I just say there's an elephant in the room? "Can I just say I'd like to say something about Princess Diana? "I felt sorry for her. So thick and yet so thin." I mean, it was never broadcast... So there is an American comedy story about something that WAS broadcast. {\an5}It was a comedy show about the differences between America and the UK. {\an5}There is an opening monologue. It was filmed a few days before it aired. And during the monologue, the host said, "You guys have lifts - we have elevators. "You guys have pavements - we have sidewalks." "You guys have Princess Di - and we wish she would." {\an1}GASPS {\an5}Yes. And that was filmed a few days before it aired. But guess what happened in between? I took some speed and made her die. {\an8}So I had my photo taken. We're both drinking champagne, looking chummy. {\an8}And a week later, Ian McKellen phones me and says, {\an8}"I didn't know you knew David Hockney!" Sandi, why are you not good with faces? {\an5}Is it anybody's face or...? Oh, darling, I'm hopeless at remembering anybody famous. I'm really rubbish at remembering famous people. I just don't have the facility for it. And I've had so many occasions... I'm not having a drink now, but I do like to have a drink. {\an5}And very occasionally, I end up what the press insist on calling "pissed". What I prefer to term as "tired and emotional". And I was once in New York with the great Mike McShane. Wonderful American comic and improviser. And we got very tired and emotional. {\an5}And we persuaded one of those horse and buggies that go round Central Park to take us to our hotel, which was a place on 82nd Street. And it's not what these characters are supposed to do. {\an5}They're suppose to go round Central Park. We were, "Go on - take us home!" So Mike and I - SO drunk! - arrive at this extremely expensive hotel and Mike has conceived the notion he wants a picture with the horse. So we get the man who is trying to get us off... And this guy's going into the hotel. {\an5}Mike says, "Come here! Take a picture of me and my friendly horse!" {\an5}So we have pictures taken with the horse, and we're so grateful to this man, Michael says, {\an5}"You should be in the picture! Come here!" So there's the man who's taken the picture, {\an5}and the horse and me and Mike McShane, taken by the driver of the horse and carriage. {\an5}This is in the days when photographs had to go through Boots for a short while. {\an5}So you had to go to the chemist to get your photographs back. Sounds terrible! {\an5}So about a week later, Mike phoned me and said, "Sandi, I got the pictures back." He said, "You know the guy with the horse?" I said, "Yes?" He said, "It's Lionel Richie." I mostly have no idea who... I don't have any idea. Why is Lionel Richie doing rides round the park? That is the confusing part of that story! You do expect to see people in certain places. If it was a pottery class, Lionel might be there. Is it you simply don't know what these people look like, or that you have prosopagnosia - face blindness? I don't know. I'm fine with my family. I remember all my children. Well, that's good. I remember going to Ian McKellen's birthday party and I didn't realise it was being sponsored by Hello magazine - a magazine I've never in my life looked at, even when I'm desperate. {\an5}They said, "Would you have your photograph taken with another guest?" I was introduced to a man in a crumply suit with glasses and I thought it was Alan Bennett. I didn't hear what they said. We're both drinking champagne, looking chummy. A week later, Ian McKellen phones me up and says, "I didn't know you knew David Hockney!" That's fair enough, isn't it? Yes. You could have a stab at that might be Hockney. They're both from Yorkshire. One from Leeds, one from Bradford. Glasses? Yes. So, Stephen Fry, Blur and Oasis. Yes. I made it clear - I didn't mean to sound nasty about it - but rock and roll music is not really my thing. Do you understand what this means, Alex? Yeah, of course I do. In '94, you had these two bands who were massively popular. They weren't really rivals, but it was kind of built up... It was the number one story on the Six O'Clock News on the BBC. So, anyway, this is shameful and doesn't paint me in any particularly good colours, {\an5}but I was a bit of an habitue of the Groucho Club in London when it opened. I used to play snooker there every day {\an5}with a variety of people, because it was a time of a little of what was horribly called Cool Britannia. Damien Hirst, for example, the artist... And he and his fellow Young British Artists were big at the time. {\an5}And I remember going in one afternoon, beautiful sunny afternoon, {\an5}and there were two quite spectacularly good-looking young men sitting at the bar, looking a bit nervous. {\an5}Now, I'm a very self-conscious club member. I think a club should be sociable - it's about being nice to people and being welcoming. So I went up to them and said, "Hello!" And they went, "Hi." {\an5}I said, "Are you enjoying yourselves here? I haven't seen you here before." They went, "No, we've not been here before." I said, "Well, people mock it who aren't part of it. {\an5}"They think it's all sneery and posey, but it's actually a very friendly place. {\an5}"I hope you're enjoying yourself. Let me buy you drinks. What would you like?" So I bought some drinks. I said, "Why don't you join the club?" They said, "How do you do that?" I said, "Well, I think I can help." So I went out into reception and said, "Get me two proposal forms." Being a club, you have to be proposed by a member. So I got two proposal forms and popped them down on the bar. I said, "OK, I'll fill in these bits here. "What do you do? It's asking what..." One of them said, "Musician." "Musician - jolly good! And you?" "Musician." "Musician! Both musicians. Very nice. {\an5}"Are you in work? Are you in a symphony orchestra, or what sort of...? He said, "No. We have a band." "Oh! How nice to have a band. That's lovely. So what's your name?" He says, "Damon Albarn." "Damon Albarn." "OK, Damon...Albarn? I've written All Bran - I'm sorry! "Silly me! That's it. "Albarn. There we are. "Does your band have a name? Is it the Rocking somethings or...?" He said, "Blur." "What?" "Blur." "Bleurgh?!" "Oh, Blur as in blurry? OK, Blur. "And your name's Alex...what? James? Alex James, all right. "There we are. Pop that down. You can be members." I found someone else to second it and they became members. I introduced Alex James into the dark ways of the snooker room. And we were playing snooker one evening... Damien Hirst, Alex, Keith Allen. And this man comes up the back stairs. Like this. And I'll try and moderate my language here! But this is the nicest way of saying it. NORTHERN ACCENT: "You're all wankers! "You're all wankers, you. Wankers!" And he took a billiard cue... You know, snooker cue. ..and rammed it up into the ceiling, like that. "Wankers!" And went downstairs again. {\an5}I still felt a bit proprietorial about the club and so I said to Alex James, "I'm awfully sorry. This doesn't normally happen at the club. "Obviously someone's come in off the street and..." And Alex said, "It's all right." He got a pen out and wrote round it, "Liam Gallagher did this" on the mark on the ceiling. And that was the battle of Blur and Oasis as I remember it. {\an5}Did that mark stay there for some time? For a very, very long time indeed! It's one thing to hear about punk rock, {\an5}but putting a snooker cue through the roof of a private members-only club, that really drives it home! One of the best things I saw in the Groucho was the manager, Liam... Liam Carson, he was called. Nothing to do with Liam Gallagher. I was sitting with him at one end and someone from reception came up and said, "This tramp's come in and we don't know what to do." {\an5}Now, of course, you have a club like the Groucho Club in the middle of Soho... {\an5}Soho's a wonderful part of London and it will have street people and sometimes they'll wander in. And Liam said, "I'll deal with it." {\an5}And I thought, "I wonder how he deals with it? It'll be really interesting." {\an5}So I followed him out to the reception area and I could see this man. I could just see the stubble and this big old coat - looked a wreck of a coat. And out came Liam, and Liam said, "So, Mr Pacino, how can I help you?" It was Al Pacino. And the receptionist was going... He did look a mess. He had eyes like pissholes in the snow and... HE GRUNTS Like that. He was in Marathon Man, wasn't he, with...? No, that was Dustin Hoffman. I love that story! About him staying up all night... The William Goldman story? Laurence Olivier is gonna torture him... In the dentist's chair. And he's being kept awake, so he decides to stay awake. {\an5}Because his character has been awake all night, so he as an actor should stay awake all night. {\an5}So he comes on set, having not slept for two whole nights, looking an utter ruin, an utter mess. Olivier says, "My dear fellow, what's the matter?" And Dustin says, "Well, my character hasn't, you know... "He hasn't slept, so I've not slept." He said, "Oh, my dear, dear darling! "You should try acting - it's so much easier." {\an1}APPLAUSE I've heard that version, where he gets the last laugh. But the second version, he says, "My dear boy..." Very pretentiously. {\an5}"My dear boy, why don't you try acting?" Then Dustin Hoffman, cos he hasn't slept for two days, goes, "Fuck off, you limey prick!" Well, that's possible! Did you ever meet William Goldman? He's a friend. Is he? We've met each other regularly. Because I had the weirdest experience when I was 18 years old. {\an5}I went to a bagel place in New York and I was sitting there with my then girlfriend, and we hadn't got any money and we wanted to look around New York. {\an5}This can only happen in New York - where the rich and the not-so-rich will sit in the same place, {\an5}eating at the same place. This woman leant over and said, "I have a car. Would you like my car?" We went, "Yeah!" We went outside. {\an5}She had a chauffeur and a limo and she gave us the chauffeur and the limo for the entire afternoon, and it was William Goldman's wife. I've never forgotten it. It was one of the kindest things I've ever had. I think it was about...eight, seven years ago, when Twitter was just gaining what's horribly called traction. He had heard about this and had heard about my connection with it and said, "What's all this Twitter stuff?" I took my phone out and said, "Can I tweet that we're having dinner?" "Sure - whatever that means." {\an5}I said, "Having dinner with the wonderful screenwriter William Goldman. Any messages for him?" And I said, "I'm going to press send now." At that time, I only had, like, three or four million followers. Sorry! STEPHEN LAUGHS And, er... And, er... {\an5}Anyway, within seconds, people were replying with... The most common one was "Inconceivable!" Which is the line from Princess Bride. "Inconceivable!" And I was going, "There you go - inconceivable. There's one here... " 'Who are those guys?' From Butch Cassidy. " 'Follow the money, from All The President's Men.' " And he was so funny. He looked and went... "Where are they? "Where is this coming from?" I said, "They're from all over. {\an5}"They could be from Germany, Australia, America, round the corner..." "How did it get in there?!" He was really puzzled. {\an8}There's salmon in the fridge for Sara Pascoe! {\an8}Sara Pascoe is being neutered today! Sandi, you seem to me quite posh. Hmm. You do seem quite posh. No. But you're not posh? Not in the slightest. It's that terrible thing of having the accent and not the money. {\an5}I grew up all over the world. My father was a foreign correspondent for Danish television. {\an5}I say that like we had many! He was THE foreign correspondent. We just had the one. So I grew up in Africa and mostly in New York. Were both parents Danish? No, my mother's English. My father's passed away now, but we spoke Danish at home. So most of my growing-up was in New York and I had a very thick New York accent. And then I got thrown out of... What kind of New York accent? {\an5}CLIPPED NEW YORK ACCENT: Sure. I talked like that. What's your trouble? What's your problem? Brooklyn accent? I had a Brooklyn accent. In fact, I was confirmed... Because she used to speak to Lionel Richie. Before she forgot who he was! So I got thrown out of three American schools in a row, which is quite a lot. What for? The accent. I think mostly it was a misunderstanding. {\an5}Particularly the last one. Apparently, you're supposed to be there every day. At what ages were you expelled? So, 12, 13, 14, I got thrown out. {\an5}I found school really boring. I remember Mrs Baxter, who was our English teacher. She said, {\an5}"This year, class, we're gonna be reading Catcher In The Rye. This is very exciting." She handed out copies of Catcher In The Rye. I went home and read it and prepared to talk about it. I didn't realise we were going to read it one word at a time all year. And I thought, "Well, I'll come back when they've read it." So boring! And the last school, my parents went to a PTA meeting... Which is very odd. They'd never done that before. And they couldn't find a teacher who knew me. {\an5}So the game was up. So I got sent to British boarding school when I was 14. I'd never lived in Britain before. {\an5}I arrived with a very thick New York accent. So your parents were still in New York? Yes. They flew me over to go to a school that they didn't even visit. They just picked one. {\an5}Did you ever think about being a fly on the wall while they were having that conversation? {\an5}Did they discuss it with you? They didn't. I think they picked the one with the highest walls. It was a terrible school! "Let's just send her over there!" So I arrived, and I remember meeting... Matron opened the door. {\an5}She said, "Good afternoon." I said, "Oh, hi! I'm Sandi. What's your name?" {\an5}"I'm Matron." "What - is that your first name or last name? How's that work?" And then at the next school... Yeah! So that was instant love. Because I had an American accent, the girls did something... They sent me somewhere I'd never even heard of, which is Coventry. For the first six weeks I lived in the UK, nobody spoke to me. I mean, nobody... I'm fine. {\an5}And we didn't watch television at school, but one night we were shown a film in the hall {\an5}and it was Brief Encounter. A wonderful film with Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard. The best! I knew by then I had to change my accent, and so I thought, "I'm going to speak like that." {\an5}That is why I sound like I'm trapped in a black and white film. But it is... It's fake. It was because I couldn't bear for people not to speak to me. Is your inner monologue the same voice or in a New York accent? When I'm tired, I speak with an American accent. Do you dream in Brooklyn-ese or, like...? I don't know. I think of home as New York and I still have great friends from the time when I was at... {\an5}I didn't know anybody from school, but other people from the neighbourhood. {\an5}How many passports have you got? Two. A British and Danish. So not American? Not American, no. My brother is British. I was born in Denmark. I have a Danish passport. {\an5}And my sister is American. And my father always used to say it was a good job he only had three children, because one on four in the world is Chinese and that would be confusing. Sara... Yeah? Can you confess about tickles? About tickles? {\an5}This is another story... I do come out of this very badly, but I was very young. When I was 11... You killed another Royal Family member? Yeah! Yeah, Prince Philip. Yeah, he's been dead for ages. So when I was 11, one of my jobs was that I would collect the Family Allowance, {\an5}when is a small amount of money you get from the Government when you have a family. I'd go to the post office and collect it. And on the way there, I would often pop into the pet shop and see what they had, cos I really love animals. And there was this day when they had two kittens. {\an5}They'd never had kittens before - it was usually mice or rabbits. They had two kittens and I plotted a plan... ..watertight, that I would buy one... Get one free. It should have been that! It was the days before those heady offers. I went and collected my mum's money, which was about £20, and I spent it on a kitten. And I got home and I told my mum that I'd found this cat meowing in a bush on the journey. But at the same time, the money had flown away. But I'd got it from the pet shop. She didn't believe me. At that point, I realised my mum was psychic. Or had been watching me with secret cameras. {\an5}There was a while when I got really paranoid when I'd done lots of naughty things {\an5}that I thought there could be these invisible cameras which followed you down the street. Then I realised that there definitely were. How else would she know? I called the cat Tickles. Then my mum... I now know what she did. {\an5}She asked around and found somebody to take it, but she told me that it had blown away. Clever! Yeah. So I had nothing left to say. So, Sara, it's funny that the cat's name is Tickles. Cos my girlfriend's cat... {\an5}It's called Sara Pascoe, which is my full name. Yeah, my girlfriend's cat is called Sara Pascoe. {\an5}Alex goes out with one of my best friends, Katherine Ryan, the most amazing comedian in the world. Her daughter, who I won't name, is an incredible human being... {\an5}I don't know if she was trying to wind her mum up or what her angle was, but they got a little male kitten and she could name it, and it's called Sara Pascoe - has to be full name. So Katherine's life is so weird now. I get screen grabs of text going, "There's some salmon in the fridge for Sara Pascoe." "Sara Pascoe is being neutered today." {\an5}There's a way you're referred to around the house. She's like, "When do we get to see human Sara Pascoe?" {\an5}That's it! And you know the Philip Pullman books, the idea of having a Daemon? {\an5}Absolutely. The minute they named a little boy cat, a little kitten, Sara Pascoe, {\an5}something happened in me where there's always a part of me running over roofs. {\an5}I love it so much! Is it possible this male kitten is channelling your fake gay self? Of course! Of course. It's poetic irony. I love this! It's so funny, cos I try really hard with the kid, but she's like... {\an5}For instance, her mom sent me to check on her to make sure she was asleep. I opened the door and she was on her iPad. And so I said, "Hey, I'm gonna tell your mom that you're asleep. "But she's gonna check in ten minutes, so go to bed," thinking, "I've just scored some good points with the kid." I go back into my girlfriend's room and told her what I said. She's like, "Good job." {\an5}Nine minutes later, she comes in rubbing her eyes, "I had a bad dream!" And we can't call her on it, because then I'm in trouble. The next day, my girlfriend's brushing her daughter's hair and her daughter just goes... "Alex is nice." And my girlfriend goes, "Yeah." And she says, "But he's a liar." {\an1}APPLAUSE And my girlfriend says, "What are you talking about?" And she said, "Well, when Alex told you that I was asleep last night, "I wasn't asleep." My girlfriend says, "That means..." Just like the blow-away thing. {\an5}"..that means when you came in and said you had a bad dream, you were lying." And she just goes... "Alex told me to say that." Wow! Do you know what we learn from this, Alex? What? Children are bastards! {\an1}APPLAUSE {\an5}You've been marvellous guests. Thank you. We now have to come up with a title for the show. I liked the one with "Titty titty tit tit". I really loved that. I do have "Titty titty titty" written down. I like "Children are bastards!" I'm really pleased, because that's also written on my list! I've never had a list before. This is exciting. {\an5}And the one about the horse as well. Something with Lionel Richie. Did you write those down? {\an5}I didn't write anything about Lionel Richie. I wrote down "So thick and so thin". I like that. I wrote down "JD and Coke, four of." {\an5}I wrote down "I don't know if it was the embarrassment or the narcotics, but I have a nosebleed." That might be the loveliest one we've ever had. I like it a lot. I like "Human Sara Pascoe". Thanks, Alan! I like, "Alex is nice, but he's a liar". And I also like, "Of course you know I've had them both?" I've also got written down, "I'm sorry, who is R Kelly?" All really good. They're all good titles. {\an5}Anyway, listen. Thank you so much. Please will you thank Alex Edelman... Thanks so much. CHEERING ..Sandi Toksvig... {\an1}CHEERING ..Stephen Fry... CHEERING ..and Sara Pascoe. CHEERING Human Sara Pascoe. My name's Alan Davies and you have been watching {\an5}I Don't Know If It Was The Embarrassment Or The Narcotics, But I Have A Nosebleed. Goodbye!
