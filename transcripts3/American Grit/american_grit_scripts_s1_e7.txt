 American Grit (2016–…): Season 1, Episode 7 - Dawn Patrol - full transcript 
 WWE Superstar John Cena informs the remaining contestants that they will need to be mentally and physically prepared to dive right into their next mission at any point, because the next evolution will not be scheduled. Additionally, this will mark the first time that "The Cadre" leaders will not be allowed to accompany their teams during the first half of their evolution, after the competitors are led to a secret location and challenged to navigate through a series of check points, while carrying a heavy case and weighted backpack. With an interesting balance of teams left in the game, only one team will outshine the rest during the evolution and be safe from facing "The Circus". Up to a million dollars of prize money is at stake, and these competitors will work together with only two options: to persevere and win or give up, "ring out" and go home.

 Previously on "American Grit"... There you go. With Team Nick fresh off their first win, a new Evolution had the teams trying to bridge their way to victory. Aah! But Team Noah... All right. Slide it. Just slow and steady. Regained their swagger and finished first. Whoo! Seems as if all they needed was a wake-up call.

 At the Circus, Team Tee's Ivette faced Jim from Team Nick and Goldie from Team Rorke. - Come on, Jim! - Yeah, Jim! You stay where you are. And to Tee's dismay... Hang in there. Ivette went home... Ivette is out. We did it again. I'm so sorry. Leaving Tony as the sole member of Team Tee. It is time to wake up! Tonight... with just one member remaining,

 Team Tee faces the risk of total elimination. Hope this is the right way. Tony needs to make it through. You don't want to be the first branch to get eliminated. Meanwhile, the other teams are still three strong. But they will all be put to their toughest test. Give me your hand. Please. Jim, I'm trying my hardest. I know. I know. - This... - Ow! Oh! Doesn't feel right. Now, my fear is that the team is gonna start breaking down. All I ask is all you got, K. Come on. We're the only team that's beaten Team Noah, and it's time to do it again. Mark, slow down! Who will be the next contestant to give up, ring out, and go home on "American Grit"? ♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪ All alone now ♪ We in the fire ♪ Gonna burn it down ♪ Get out alive ♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh! It's over! ♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪♪ What's up? - Hey, hey! - Oh! Hey, hey, hey! What's going on, everybody? Old man, huh? Dang. You good? I'm all right. I'm all right. We lost our girl. I am the single one left, and six weeks ago, we had a full team, and now we're down to one. Last one standing, you know what I mean? So, kind of lonely, just lonely right now. Boom! You guys don't kick in wrestling. - Yeah, we do. - You do, like, chest kick? Like, right in the chest? - Yeah, it's called a sick kick. - I don't get it. You know, his sport is very interesting. I've never met anybody who's a wrestler. - You make contact? - Yeah. Oh. I thought it was like you just came close enough. You know, he is kind of a clown. But clowns are entertaining. And everybody wants to keep them around. Aah! Ah! Ah! Ah! You're not even doing anything. I don't... What do you mean? Why does that look...? Tap out. - Someone's at the door. - I'll get it. I'll get it. I got it. I got it. Holy smokes. - Delivery! - What you got? The knock at the door put fear in me. I was... Hey! Oh, it's compasses. - Who was it, Cam? - Oh, man. It was just at the door. You guys, we're about to get lost. And it's a delivery, and it's just four compasses. One for each team. Green. Tony. - Blue. - What it is now? - Do you know how to use one? - Yeah. You do? Okay. I don't. You want to know how I spell "compass"? It's called G-P-S. I don't know. I mean, obviously... This is land navigation. I've had classes in it, but I didn't pay attention. I hope Noah's team doesn't know about land nav. So azimuths are 0 to 360. I used to tutor a lot of different compass stuff and mapping... I tutored a lot of mapping in college, so, yeah, this is right up my alley. Not a lot of people here know much, probably, about compasses at all. Probably don't even know how to look at them. I feel like they're gonna come and drop us off in the middle of nowhere, and we got to find our way back home. This puts me at a point to be prepared for anything, so I feel like 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, I got to be in competition mode. I think a very important part is to early to bed. I guess I'm gonna be sleeping like the lumberjack. No covers, 'cause I'm just gonna have my clothes on. Yeah. Like, I'm... No more Cam snuggles for Haze. I'll just have to let Cam down gently. Nah. Let him down hard. I'm telling you... I don't think we should get in the hot tub. I don't think we should shower yet. I don't think we should even do much. We can't put our life on hold. I'm telling you, though. I've got a weird feeling that something's happening sooner than later. Socks on all night. Okay. Reveille, reveille, reveille, reveille! That means you have less than five minutes! It is time to wake up! My goodness, Cam, you look like a modern-art masterpiece. Oh, this must be a dream. I'm waking up to John Cena. Let's go! He was very angry, and he was yelling at us to get ready. I didn't want to upset him further by doing my hair, so... excuse me for this mess. Let's go! Move it! Move it! Move it! Team Rorke, ready to go. Way to hop to it. We prepared for this moment. We were sleeping in our underlayers. We had our shoelaces untied and ready to jump into. We have to win for Rorke. You guys are burning daylight at this point. Waiting on one, please. It is time to get up. We got some work to do today. Cena is the worst alarm clock you could wake up to, ever. Your next Evolution starts now. Let's go outside, then. Go. Let's go. Out and on the truck. Out and on the truck. Yeah, getting woken up in the middle of the night happens all the time, especially on deployments. When it's never happened to you before, it's a pretty rude awakening. We are going on a little drive this morning. First time it happened to me, I was like, "Why did I sign up for this?" I have presents for you guys. These are blindfolds. Make sure to put them on and do not take them off. All righty, here are the rules. This Evolution is called Dawn Patrol. When this truck stops, you must make your way to a stockpile of equipment. There, among other items, are instructions on how to complete the rest of this Evolution. Fire it up! Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy yourselves. Go, go, go, go, go! Five minutes ago, I'm in my warm little place. Next thing I know, I'm on some open-top military vehicle with a blindfold on, heading to some unknown location. I'm hoping it's a nightmare, but now I know this is real... real bad. ♪ I have no idea what time it is. All I know is it felt like I maybe slept two or three hours. And we're loaded into this truck and blindfolded and have no idea where we're going. It seemed like we drove forever. - Oh, my goodness. - All right. - Let's go. - Let's do this. All of a sudden, we're dropped off in the middle of nowhere, and it's pouring rain, freezing cold, and I'm thinking, "This has not even started yet." Stay dry. Stay dry if you can. You guys, this is insane. We take off our blindfolds, and we just start marching down a trail. It was a moment of sheer panic for me. Ugh! There it was. Soggy, wet feet for the next six hours. From there, we're gonna have to find our wits. Here they are! At the equipment stockpile, teams will find a large case, a weighted backpack, and their field instructions. Cool. Each team will have to carry their gear through treacherous terrain, as they use their compass... We go that way, directly that way. To locate their Cadre over three miles away. Yeah, I was worried about the land navigation part. You said something smart. 'Cause you're stressing out. I'm not stressing. Me and the rest of the Cadre are at Checkpoint B. This is a chance for the teams to do it on their own. I wouldn't say I'm not necessary, but they're supposed to run on their own. My job isn't to micromanage. - Go, Team Noah. - Yeah, yeah. -Trekking in the woods. Oh, look. There's an LBM... Little brown mushroom. Growing up in Washington, as a family, we used to always go mushroom picking... Oh, my God, a chanterelle! So it's really hard for me to run through these woods without kind of always keeping one eye to the ground. It's a chanterelle mushroom. They're highly sought after. Just prime mushrooming around here. Okay, we should be getting close. K, are you just doing certain deep breathing? KJOY was huffing and puffing up those hills to the point where I thought she was having an asthma attack. I think that's her yoga expert coming out. I'm always a super, super deep breather. People always make fun of it, 'cause, like, "You sound like Darth Vader." And I was like, "That's just how I breathe." I have to. It powers my body. What would Nick say? Nick would say, "Hurry up." - We're just hanging out. - This feels like ranger school. It does a little bit. We have to win this. Rangers are really heavy into land navigation. Behind enemy lines, you have to know where you're at at all times. Watch the trees. Watch the trees. Ugh. The fact that Tony's got to do this with no team and no Cadre... It greatly affects him. The other teams are able to strategize and figure out what the mission is all about. That's not good. Tony's just got to rely on himself. That's all right. Aah! A compass? We need a damn machete. You sure we on the right trail? - We're good. - We're struggling with this. I hope they perform well in this competition. As a military Cadre member, you kind of cringe at the fact that you have all this experience doing exactly this skill set. So the fact that I can't give them guidance on this one is a tough pill to swallow. - Where's Rorke? - Where is Rorke? We'll be waiting for a minute. It sounded like I heard something. That's it. So I see Team Noah's in first... yet again. It's definitely frustrating. How we doing, Noah? - Good. - Good? Tony needs to make it through. There's no if, ands, or buts about it. It's no way I want to have that reputation as being the Marines were the first to go home. Has anyone else showed up here? - No. - What's this? At Checkpoint Bravo, each team must solve a navigation problem to open their case... 5-4-0-0. Yep. Good. Which holds a map with the location of their final destination... The observation platform at the Circus. Be careful. You may see another road. - Make sure it's that main road. - Yep. I wasn't able to help them before, but now I can, and being good at land navigation, I can help plot out on the map what would be the best route for them to get to the next point. That way. Right down where you came. Okay, watch the sticks. Going slow. Stepping over a log. Once again, it's the three of us waiting for our teams. Yeah. Well, where are we? We should be seeing Checkpoint Bravo. In the woods, but we're gonna have to enter. This is gonna be hell to pay if it's not right. All we knew is we were looking for location B. Mario's completely confident in our mapping and navigating abilities, but I feel like we are completely lost. I'm just feeling, like, so discouraged. - We got to keep moving. - Yeah, go front. - Hey. - What does Tony say? - Listen. - What's up? We need to find a bond until we get to Checkpoint B. - Feel me? - Yeah. As I'm walking up the hill, I run into Team Nick, and it was good to see them. We were all sticking close to each other, till we find Bravo. We were gonna collaborate, but they knew, coming to the end, down the final stretch, we were gonna run for it. What, you just feel like this should be the way? We're almost there. Look, look, look. - Poisonous. - Good morning, Cadres. They're right on you. Come on. Noah's team has already came and gone. Checkpoint B, Tony came in second. He's definitely still hanging in there with or without Ivette. Take it out and use the piece of paper. Do your math. Tee is just telling me, basically, "Relax. You got it." Don't forget your line. It was nice to have Tee there to help me figure out this problem or keep me calm. Okay. Get that. That's 5,400. - 5,400? - Yes. - There it is. - Good job, guys. - Sweet. - Easy math. When I first joined the military, I was terrible at land nav. I grew up in the city, so a map and a compass was kind of new to me. And the first time I actually went through land nav, I failed. I cried. I cried that day. Yeah, I did. Why not just take this road out? You know it's gonna cut off to the left. Now, you put me anywhere on the world with a compass and a map, I can find my way out. Put me on Mars. I'm good there too. If you can, take the roads, all right? This doesn't feel right. Where are we? We're getting to the road soon. Aren't we supposed to be getting to B? Yeah, the... B is behind the road. I'm waiting at Point Bravo alone, you know, hoping my team finds it. But when you're lost, you have to go to a spot that we can somehow identify. - Oh! Ugh! Hold up. - There are tons of thorns, yo. Look at your compass. You know north. Start heading west until you hit a road. If you don't hit a road, sooner or later you're gonna hit the Pacific Ocean. So you now know where you are. Put the pain out of our brain. Yep. Come on. Embrace the suck. Embrace the suck. Now I'll look like the same old team that comes dead last. Do you feel confident about the direction we're going? - Just got to go up this way. - Okay. Do not touch anything when you go through here. Well, we head off through the woods, and there was some, like, devil's club, blackberry bushes, Aah! What the heck was that? Those are called blackberries. Thorns everywhere. I'm like, "Are you sure we're going the best way?" I'm sorry, guys. We went the wrong way. Jim, push it. Just pull it. You guys might want to go the water way since you have that big thing.. We're going through the thick forest, and Tony was pretty much on our tail. And we're thinking, like, "Oh, we're totally screwed." So you see the clearance up there? Hurry up. Hurry, hurry, hurry. - You ready? - Hurry. Yeah. If you get a chance, pass. Then as we found our path again and realized that Team Noah is right in front of us... We still have a chance. Catch up. Come on. Catch her, catch her, catch her, catch her. Come on. Stay with them. Go, go, go. Follow them. Follow them. Follow them. I'm trying. We're just chasing green through the woods. Our plan was to just stay on them and just drive them until they broke. Jim, let's smoke 'em out. - Mark. - Yes? Give me your hand. Please. She's gassed. KJOY, we got this. I can't. You got it! Yes, you can, Clare. She's scared. We're gonna scare her more. - Let's run. - Good job. Good job. Green is right there. Trying to catch up with these two teams. I'm right on their tail. - Red team's behind us. - We can't finish like this. - Let's catch them. - Long strides downhill. Let's kick them in the face. Come on. The red team is really annoying. You just couldn't let up. I mean, the red team was on our heels like a pack of hungry wolves. - See, they're worried. - They are worried. They're scared. Catch up. Come on. - Red team's behind us. - Let's catch them. Come on, guys. Strategy is now, try to make up some pace. - There it is. - It's right there! Going to the Circus. We're really, really close. We can't let up at all, because red team is just, like, hanging on our tails. You're gonna have to help me. David, don't... Let's rush to the finish. Come on. Get up here. Do you want to watch them cross the finish like this? Jim, I'm trying my hardest. I know. I know. Mark, slow down. We just got to get to the stairs. All I ask is all you got, K. Come on. Help me. It's right there. Come on! Let's go! Come on, guys. This is all we got. Looks like we got a close race. - Gut it out. Gut it out. - Ugh! Help me. How about this? Green team is close! It is... Here's the red team Come on! No, no, no! It's not over! But to no avail! Boom! They just will not be denied! Too little, too late. We had ourselves a close race. You were only nine seconds behind Team Noah. - Damn it. - Unbelievable, guys. What a hell of a race. My stomach turned to see them cross the finish line when we were so close. - We gave it all we had. - We gave it everything. We gave it all we had. Jim and I kept pushing KJOY, and I think what set me off was KJOY said, "I can't." I could not possibly go any faster. And here he is. Army of one, himself. Tony, hell of an effort, my man. Hell of an effort. I know this has been a constant struggle with Tony being on his own in this competition, but I'm glad that he fought it out today. And Team Nick, just think: it was only nine seconds... Oh, my gosh. That got them safety and a reward and got you guys a ticket back to the Circus. We'll probably be waiting for blue. Are we supposed to climb the hill? - Yeah. - Whatever's the quickest. Watch your step. - Are you okay, Mario? - I'm good. Time-out. My team is nowhere to be found. So, at this point, I don't even want rescue going out for them. I think they need to spend the night in the woods, maybe appreciate doing something different in the next round. Is there, like, a white flag we can put up? S.O.S.? It has to be in here somewhere. ♪♪ What we got? What we got? Yeah, buddy! Oh, yeah. You guys won massages. Ooh, my legs need this. After the Evolution, my body was spent, and I was ready to get a massage. Nobody else gets this but us. The joys of being the winners. You see this? They couldn't go somewhere else and do that? - Right? - Can you go on the patio? Do you understand we were steps behind... - I know. - And that would be us in there. - So ridiculous. - At least you guys were, like, hot on their tails. We were lost in the woods, like... It's weighing on me that here we are again, Team Rorke, the last team to finish. Do you see this... What's going on here? Like, do we really want to sit here... I'm gonna go hate on them from my room. I just want to win an Evolution. I'm tired of going to Circus. This is the second time I've ever had a massage. I've always wanted them. They're expensive. I have to spend my money on bills, and... I have a girlfriend, and we're currently having a baby. So my massages are rolling on top of logs on my back. I'd love to get more massages. I'm feeling so down after the Evolution... Frustrated, angry. I get so down on myself. I tend to shut down. What's up? What are you doing? Nothing. Do you have a minute? - Do I have a minute? - Yeah. Cam is super depressed. I would love to cheer him up a little bit. - Come here, you. - Whoa. Cam and I have been having some really steamy make-out sessions. It's getting a little deeper than I had anticipated it getting. I just wanted to kiss you one last time before we're competitors. - Is that okay? - Yeah. No, that's fine. I'm hesitant. Ten years is a huge, huge age gap. But I feel like I haven't made out in forever, and it's really fun. All right! Romance and work don't mix. But they're young. Whatever. It wouldn't be me. Whoo! ♪♪ You know what? I'm tired of getting beat. I'm tired of finishing last. - What happened? - We decided to take the woods. This terrain was extremely difficult. Kind of struggled a little bit there. I'm tired of them having to go find our team out there on the course somewhere. I'm sure my SEAL teammates would be real happy for getting lost in the woods. - Yeah. - Sickening. What do you think it is that we keep coming in dead last? It's not like we're coming in last on everybody's tails. - Yeah. - It's... Team Rorke is having to be found in the woods. I feel like, at this point, they're just a juggernaut of a team. The nice thing is I can tell we've all also kind of embraced the fact that we're gonna be on the toughest path. And in that phase, we are crushing it. This competition has just been peaks and valleys. And right now, I can tell my team is in a valley, so I need to come up with a way to get them excited. ♪♪ - Watch your step. - Okay. I wanted to get out into a powerful spot to spend time before we go into this Circus. And I want to talk a little bit about ammunition. You guys are my ammunition, like, to shoot at the people we're competing against. You know, you're all different, and so I feel like I get to choose different rounds for the different job. My favorite round in a fight was these .50-caliber rounds that I want to give you guys here. Aw! But I got Mario, which I feel like is my all-purpose crusher round. I got Haze, who's obviously sent multiple people home. - Wow. - And Goldie is ready to fight. I used that bullet to kind of fire them up. It represents all these rounds I expended on the battlefield, chasing our nation's enemies, doing the job that we were asked to do on behalf of the country. So a SEAL buddy of mine made these up for you. - Thank you. - Thank you. This gift is something that I'm gonna take with me forever... this moment. Every time I look back, I'm gonna think about Goldie. I'm gonna think about Mario. I'm gonna think about Rorke. I'm gonna think about this beautiful place and just how special it is. - Thank you so much. - No. Thank you. - Thank you. - Yep. ♪♪ I don't want to just talk about, you know, competition all the time. I want to know more about y'all. You know, as we're getting closer to the end, I really want to know them even more. I feel like the more we know of each other, the tighter a group we are and a better team we are. If you had to sum yourself up in one story... A story about you on the fishing boat... There was a Mayday over the radio, so we answered the Mayday, and there was a pretty large guy, and he was laying on the gravel, and he just had, like, a cotton blanket over him. Hypothermic, possible spinal injury, He was still in his wet clothes, and he was laying directly on the ground. And I was like, "Okay, this is it. I'm taking over this scene," you know? Basically, we cut his clothes off of him. I stripped down and got in next to him. He was just so cold. And then the Coast Guard showed up, and off they went, you know. And that's just pretty much me. If the scene is not controlled and I have the tools and know how to do it, I'm just gonna take it over. That was a great story. I don't have anything that can... Rival that. No, um... so I ran track, made it to State Finals in the 100-meter dash. I was like, "All right, this is clearly what I should be doing." And I remember I was being interviewed, and they asked me, "What are you gonna do with this whole track-and-field thing?" And I was like, "I'm gonna be in the Beijing Olympics." This was six years before the Olympics actually happened. A lot of what I really believe... And I believe it's scriptural as well... Is that you have to speak those things that you believe if you want them to come to pass. You know, I believe in myself, in my abilities, but also in my faith, that this is a gift that God's given me. You know, faith is at the forefront of everything that I do. I'm a minister, very spiritual. I guess that kind of defines how I live my life. Saying that you are aware of the gift... - Mm-hmm. - And you're going to use it. - Yeah. - I love that. So, Mark. - My name is Mark... And I have a twin brother. That's my story. I'm sticking to it. We're gonna talk about Circus and strategize this thing. What do you think, Jim? I don't know. I don't know. It's a tough one. Yeah. Rorke is only gonna send either Mario or Haze, and Mario's only been one time. - Yeah, that's true. - But I think Mario is his heavy hitter, but it's gonna have to come down to who can beat Tony. Jim's safe. He went to the Circus, proved himself. And knowing that Tony's going in from Team Tee, I'm really confident that Cam or KJoy can beat him. He's pretty worn, mentally and physically at this point. I'll give it my best if I have to. - Yeah. - When I get to the platform, give me whatever the disadvantage is. - Yeah. - Whatever he can't do... you're gonna be able to. - Do you know what I mean? - Yeah. I'm so sick of seeing the Circus, and I really don't feel like seeing it this week, because it pays to be honest. I think KJoy might be more beat up... - Yeah? - Than Cam. I did go up against Tony. Tony was faster in the obstacle course. Tony's gonna be real tired tomorrow. Yeah. You got to think about it. Yeah. He is not gonna be flying through that Circus obstacle course. He's probably hurting right now. You know you can beat Tony. He's ready to go. Play some mind games with him before then. Just start putting those feelings out there about how much he misses home and he should be home. Let's tell him, "Tony, you've had a good run." - Yeah. - It's been a good run. Bye! - Yeah. - It's nothing to be ashamed of. I'll give you a hug. But all of KJoy's strengths would be all of Tony's weaknesses. Really, Cam? I can see right through that? He's scared to death of the Circus, and every single time it comes down to Nick deciding if it's Cam or I going, he always puts it towards me. I think either one of us has it, Cam. Once again, an Evolution has been run. Once again, Team Noah has won that Evolution. And while we're all standing here braving the elements, Team Noah is back at base camp. Rorke, early on, you had said, "You know what? We're gonna have to win it in the Circus. That is gonna be our game plan." Enlighten me on how a strategy like that can be a beneficial approach. If you told me I could trade methodologies with Team Noah, I would. I mean, the fact of the matter is they're using that kind of MED system... Minimum effective dose... To get the result they want. But I don't think anyone here is not trying to win these challenges. The danger is, we're playing a all-in hand of Texas Hold'em every time. Tony, there is no choice. You must face the Circus. You got this. You got this. Tee, Tony has been physically taxed. He will be physically taxed again in this Circus. If he survives, he will be thrust into another physically taxing Evolution. I mean, sometimes in life, you're tested... Not just once, but over and over again. You just dig deep. You find your grit, and in that moment, you show that you're unbreakable. Tony, your grit is sure to be tested, as you have a long road ahead of you. Rorke... Goldie displayed unbelievable will in the last Circus and survived. She cannot be chosen to run. Who are you sending to the Circus? Yeah, so I've got two thoroughbreds that I get to pick from. Haze and Mario both want to get in that fight. They don't want to do it because it's fun. You know, I think they like the opportunity to come back and take that burden. So, tonight... I'm gonna send my man Mario. -You got this, brother. Mario, you've been chosen to face the Circus. ♪ I'm ready to give everything I have in this Circus. I mean, the motivation for winning... Besides the fact that I'm competing... I actually want to make a healthy change with the youth, you know? I mean, this generation is growing up with iPads and all this technology, and they're not doing anything. You know, if I can put together this youth program or a rec center where they can go, that's what I'll do with the money. Rorke, please explain your decision. I think Tony and Mario have a real similar power, speed, and ability to get after it. They both went in last time, came back together. We'll see what happens. Nick, Jim displayed unbelievable will the last Circus. He survived. He can't be chosen. Who have you chosen to face the Circus? It's one of the hardest decisions, I think, so far in this game, I've had to make. I applied the theory in my sniper community... "From a place you will not see comes a sound you will not hear." The person I'm gonna pick... You won't see them coming, and the sound you will not hear is the sound of the ringing of that bell. One of the best warriors that I have seen... One that I would take to combat... and that's KJoy. KJoy, you have been chosen to face the Circus. - Wow. Wow. I thought that I was gonna go in, and to my surprise, he picks KJoy. Not going to Circus feels like being a king in Rome and watching gladiators fight to the death in a coliseum. Nick, explain your decision. After the ice challenge, I think she proved a lot to everyone who watched and everyone here. Yeah, I think Cam would do well in that Circus, He was also kind of putting it off on KJoy, and I think that's just because he's nervous. KJoy has the greater mental stamina. You've all faced this beast and survived, which means you know that this field, especially, will push itself to the limit. I'll see you later on, and we'll all see you later at the starting line. ♪♪ Circus... Circus... Pack. Team Tee's room is solitary confinement. - Yeah. - He's all alone in there. Agree. Tony's definitely moping around the house. Tony's bubble was burst when they started losing members, and now it's down to just him. - Hey, y'all. - Hey. What's up, girly girl? I think he's the one to beat on this one, and I want to push him a little bit, because I can see that he's ready to go. You're lucky you don't have to pack tonight. I know. The packing part sucks. This Evolution would've been nice to win. Right. I need one break from the Circus. I can't keep going like this at this pace. - I'm just constantly going. - Right. - Yeah. - It breaks you down. - Yeah. - And I'm, like, you know, being 40, my body ain't recovering like it used to. Yeah. I need one break. You've had a good run. - Yeah, I know. - Well, I'm proud of you. And I think you should be proud of yourself. You've made everybody proud, including your family. I know I'm the last member of Team Tee, so everything I do now is for everybody that's... All my fallen teammates, my mom, my dad, my brothers and sisters, my kids, everybody that depend on me. So I'm gonna keep pushing, and I'll survive another one. Close it up. - I might pack a little bit too. - Right, right. We have had a really physical week. His body's beat. His mind is beat. I think, on this one, Mario and I are gonna come back, and Tony's gonna be the one ringing out. ♪ Hi, Cam. We're debating on if I wear my bling to Circus or not. That would just be rubbing it in their face. Let's go with some athletic wear. All right. There is zero part of me that wishes Nick sent Cam. I'm happy that he trusts me enough to put me up against awesome athletes like Tony and Mario. So he knows I'll get it done. I feel like he has more faith in me than in Cam. It's your time to show what you're made of once again. Yeah. I got it. I know you're coming home, brother. - I'm not even worried about it. - Right. For now, my focus is the Circus. Get in, get out, have fun. Obviously, you know, we get nerves. You know, the stakes are so high. But I can't let it play on my mind. The Circus is something I feel comfortable with and I actually have fun with. I mean, running the course is exciting for me. Do you need anything from us? No. Nothing at all. - All right. - I'll take a hug, though. ♪♪ Mario, Tony, KJoy... you've been chosen to face the Circus. You're well aware of the obstacles that await you on the course. And you know that when you hit the endurance platform, you will be tested. Today's test is called "hump day." You have a pile of sandbags. The pile will consistently be replenished. Each sandbag is 20% of your bodyweight. You'll take your sandbags, move them up a flight of steps, and bring them to another location. You must move at a constant pace. If you stop or slow down, you will be disqualified. Back and forth, back and forth until one of you gives up, rings out... goes home. The first competitor to complete the Circus will receive the longest rest. The second, the second longest. The competitor slowest through the course to arrive at the platform third has no advantage. Their test begins immediately. As usual, guys and gals, all we ask is all you got. Good luck to you all. Make your way to the start. KJoy's proved herself. She's fought through a lot of pain. She's done the most gruesome endurance challenge, I think, to date. I don't expect KJoy to come in first place, but I expect her to really crush the endurance portion of it. Here we go, Mario! Mario's a force in this Circus. He just is. Fluid and fast and powerful... It looks like it's easy to him. And then you have that little bit of nerves, that "Boy, I lose Mario, I could be in big trouble." You got this, Tony! Right now it's all about being unbreakable. This is where you prove that you have American grit, and that you are just that... Unbreakable. Here we go! Competitors, at the ready. Three, two, one, go. Here we go, KJoy! ♪ Mario first to the climbing ropes. Tony right behind him. Let's go, Tony! Feel like he's got nobody rooting for him. Mario, you are on fire! Don't stop! Good job, Mario! Whoo! Mario is fast. He is a lightning bolt up there. Let's go, Tony! There we go. Tony is next over the summit. KJoy right behind him. Good girl, K. Keep it up. K, it's at your pace. Don't worry. Good job, Mario. Mario easily past the second obstacle He is already at the giant's ladder. The man's fast. Good job, KJoy. All right, Mario, I'm gonna see you down there. You got this, Mario! There you go. Use those legs. Mario's already up and over. Nice, KJoy. ♪♪ Get it! Mario, across the beam. Tony up and over. Just move. There you go. Tony reaches the beam. He is exhausted. KJoy is struggling as well. Come on, KJoy. Right there. Right there. Big hoss, I think, is gonna smoke it. He's motoring. There he is, as predicted. Ball up. Just ball up. Careful, careful, careful! - I like it. - Human cannonball... I dig it. And, Mario, you have arrived first. Good job. You will get to rest for two minutes. Come on, KJoy! Good job, Tony! - There you go, Tony! - There you go, Tony! Good job, Tony. And Tony, second to arrive on the platform. You will have a one-minute rest. We are one KJoy short of an endurance test. - Whoo! - Nice. And here comes KJoy. There we go, KJoy. There we go. KJoy last to arrive. Let's get the helmet off and start the test. The higher you can keep the weight, the better. The endurance test starts now. K, this is all you got! All you got. Come on, K! - There you go, KJoy. - There you go, KJoy. KJoy last to arrive. There you go, KJoy! Here we go! Let's get the helmet off and start the test. The higher you can keep the weight, the better. The endurance test starts now. - There you go, baby. - K, this is all you got! You got to work. It's you at this point. It is you at this point. Come on. Come on. Come on. - You got this. - Nice, KJoy. - Come on, K! - There you go, K. - There you go, K. - You are gonna have to work. You are gonna have to work. - Come on, KJoy. - You got it. You got it. - Come on, K. - KJoy, you got a little bit of work to do now. There you go, K. Nice, KJoy. Push it, KJoy. Push it, baby. Push it! One minute. Here we go. Tony, your rest is over. Time to start the endurance. - You got this. - Just push it. Come on, guys. Come on, guys. All right, K, do some. You got a little bit of work to do. You got a little bit of work to do. - There you go, Mario. - Come on, KJoy. - Good job, KJoy. Good job. - Good job. Good job, Mario. Stay warm. Keep trucking. Got to keep trucking. - Stay warm, Mario! - All you got, KJoy. - Here we go, K! Here we go! - All you got. Nice. There you go, KJoy! Mind over matter, right? Here we go. Two minutes are up. Mario, you're now in. Here we go, Mario! Whoo! There you go, KJoy. Hey, KJoy. Nice strides, nice strides. Don't go too far down, KJoy. - Okay. - Come on. Come on. Come on, KJoy! Come on, K. Those are light, K. Good job, Mario! Test those holds, Mario. Test where you want to hold it. Low, high... just try a couple. Breathe, KJoy. You got this. Good job, Mario. I like that. Come on, KJoy. All you got. - Bring it home to me, baby. - All you got, KJoy. Give me longer strides on the way down. You got long legs. Try one with a high-chest carry just to see what it feels like. There you go, Mario. All these guys had to carry their backpacks in the Evolution. Amazingly enough that these were the ones chosen. - Here we go, KJoy! - Good job, Mario! Hang in there, Mario. Just stay in your place. Just stay in your place and focus. Keep it up, KJoy. Keep it up! - Long strides. Long strides. - Use them legs! There you go! Keep going, K. Mario, your doing it, brother! You got to keep moving here. You got some work to do. Use those legs. Nick, KJoy already breathing heavy. Just using a technique. - Okay. Fair enough. - Yoga. Fair enough. Here we go, KJoy. Good job, Mario! It's you versus you, KJoy. Don't worry about the others. - You got it, KJoy. - You versus you! - Go! - Good job, Mario. Everybody chugging away it seems like. You got this! You got it, K! You guys are gonna be forced to dig in there and dig down. There you go, Tony. Good job, Mario. - There we go, KJoy. - Good job, Mario. Yeah, shoulder's good, Mario. Those steps seem to be taking their toll. Long strides, just like that, KJoy. - Nice. - You got this! Here we go, KJoy! - Just like that. Nice. - There you go, Mario. Tony, let's go! - Nice, KJoy. - K, this is all you got! All you got! Come on, K! Let's go, Tony! One little good burst, one good burst. - There you go. - Mind over matter, right? I'm pushing as fast as I can. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! - Come on. Come on. Come on! - Give me all you got right here. You got to work. It's you at this point. It is you at this point. All you got, KJoy. Come on! Come on! Come on! You got to work! All you got, baby. Come on. Here we go, here we go. Mind over matter. Let's go! Come on! - All you got, KJoy. - Steps, man... Tony loosing layers. It's getting a little bit interesting. It's not over. Come on. My legs... they feel like they want to give out. It is you at this point! It is you at this point! Come on, come on! Got to go! Every step I take, my legs are shot. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, K. That's it. I quit. - KJoy. - Good try, KJoy. - Come here, babe. - Good try. Good job. Good job. My body quit. I went as long as I possibly could. So, at the end of the day, it just wasn't my event. You fought. That's all that counts. The more you dwell on it, beat yourself up... I made a lot of bad calls on the Circus, and guys didn't come back. You get a chance to make it home... that's what's good. - Thanks. - Yeah. You're fine. As much as you never want to renounce, as much as you never want to go home... Good job. As long as you give it your best, that's all you can really do. Did not let me down one bit. Mario, Tony, you guys survived the Circus. You live to fight another day. Please go rejoin your team. - Mario! - Whoo! Tony! Tony! - Good job. - Still here. - This is the worst part. - Don't think about it. KJoy... it is now time for you to ring out and go home. We love you, KJoy. Love you guys. - Love you guys. - We love you too. We're so proud of you. KJoy was definitely the glue, as far as, like, being almost, like, the mother figure. Take your strength and your spirit. - And we're gonna win for you. - Yes. Losing that... It hurts a little bit. But at the end of the day, sometimes being angry and pissed off... There's nothing wrong with that at this point in time. You know, we're down to two people. So, if they get pissed off, take it out on the other teams during the Evolution. You did great. Ugh. And don't ring that damn bell like I did. No, you did great. "American Grit" is an incredible experience. Even though I have to leave, there's so much good and so much joy that I'm taking out of this. - Good job. - Thanks. So, as long as you are seeing the positive in things, then you're a success. ♪♪ Let's go! Next time... the teams are tested on fortification... They want in your house? Make them work. And infiltration. - Pull, pull, pull, pull. - You're a cop. Get in there. Plus, the winners receive an extra-special reward. What is this? And Cam and Haze's relationship takes a surprising turn. She's playing you. Listen to Jim. She's playing you. That is your lover boy. At the end of the day, this is all about winning. Who will be the next contestant to give up... It's gut-check time. Ring out, and go home? Whoa!
