 Don't you push me! She got tough, and I had to clip her. Newspaper reporter. Police card. She's seen too much. Where's the phone? There's none in here. There's a booth next to the first cabin. Put that rod away. Lock them up in one of the cabins. I'm gonna call the boss. Yeah, she's a newspaper reporter. Metropolis, Daily Planet. Lane, Lois Lane. We couldn't help it. She drove in before... Yeah, I know. Yeah, sure. What do you wanna do that for, boss? Solley and me can... Okay, if that's the way you want it. Right. What did he say? You lock the dames up? Yeah, second cabin. What did the boss say? He's sending a torpedo out to knock them off. What's the idea? What's the matter with us? We ain't good enough, I guess. Who's he sending? Some rod that just blew in from Chicago. Uh... Baby Face something. Baby Face Stevens? Yeah. You know him? I heard about him. Great kid. Always making with the jokes. And you know what? What? When he does a job, he takes all the slugs out of the gun except one. Never misses. All I say is he better get here fast. This place is hot and wide open. Anybody's liable to pull in like that newspaper dame. Wait a minute. You get her car out of sight. I'll fix it so nobody pulls in. [WOMAN SOBBING] They were talking down by the last cabin, the two of them and Frank, my husband. I heard a shot and ran out. I saw Solley... That's the big one. Dragging Frank down into the gully behind the cabin. Then the other one, the one they call Mitch, grabbed me and took me back into the office and... then he hit me in the face and everything went black. Mrs. King, what's behind all this? I can't help you unless you tell me everything. How can you help me? Frank's dead. They killed him. I don't care what happens to me. Shh! You mustn't talk like that. What's the difference? The difference is we've got to get out of this. Now, please try to pull yourself together. That's better. Now, how did all this start? Tell me what happened. They were using this place as a hideout for criminals. We're only 20 miles from the Canadian border. They'd keep them here during the daytime and at night they'd sneak them over the line into Canada. We didn't know what they were doing until tonight. Take it slowly. When my husband found out, he tried to call the police, and... they killed him. [SOBBING] One of them is standing outside the office. If I could only get to a phone. Well, there's a booth by the first cabin, but... But they'll see you. Not if I go out the back window. There's a deep gully there. Be careful. I will. Hello, operator? I want the police. Hurry, please. Operator, this is an emergency. Please hurry. OPERATOR: I'm sorry, but the sheriff's office doesn't answer. I'll keep trying. Thank you. Hello, operator? Operator? Never mind that call. Get me the Daily Planet in Metropolis. Metropolis 60-500. And reverse the charges. Hurry, please! [WHISTLING] Hello, Oscar! CLARK: Just a minute, Jim! Hello, Jim. Come on in. How'd you know it was me? Don't you know that I have X-ray vision? Oh, sure! Just like Superman. That's right! What's on your mind beside the Chicago White Sox? You guessed it! They playing tonight? Yeah. Okay, you got a date. Hot dog! Too bad Miss Lane's on vacation. She wanted to see the Sox play too. Uh-huh. She get away in time? In this business? She didn't get going till after 3. No, thanks. She should have waited till morning. That's what I told her. But she said, "Nothing doing. The chief might get an idea overnight." Mm-hm. [PHONE RINGS] Kent speaking. Who? Oh, yes, inspector. What? Oh, they did. All right, I'll be right over. Where you going? Police headquarters. They've got a lead on that Ellsworth jewel robbery. I'll see you later. Hey, what about the ball game? Don't worry. What time is it now? It's 10 minutes after six. I'll meet you back here at 8:30. Okay. [PHONE RINGS] Clark Kent's office, Jim Olsen speaking. Jim, this is Lois. I thought I'd never get through to you! Oh, hi, Miss Lane. Jim, put Clark on. He just walked out the door. Well, see if you can catch him, Jim. Hurry, please. I'm in trouble. Hold on! Hello? Hello? LOIS: Clark? No, I couldn't catch him, Miss Lane. Jim, listen to me. Find Clark or the chief. Tell them I'm at the Restwell Tourist Cabins. No, no. Restwell. R-E-S-T. It's on Highway 15. It's in the Blue Hills. I'm in trouble, Jim, and if... [SCREAMS] [LOIS SCREAMING] Hello? Hello, Miss Lane? [CLICKING RECEIVER] Hello? Hello? Operator, I was just talking to someone and I was disconnected. No, I don't know the number. Wait a minute. The call came from the... The Restwell Tourist Cabins. No, I don't want Information. There isn't time for that. Look, give me police headquarters. Hello. Inspector Henderson's office. He's what? He can't be out! Well, look. Look, this is Jim Olsen from the Daily Planet. Mr. Kent left here just a few minutes ago to see Inspector Henderson. I've got to talk to him right away. No, no. Clark Kent. Yes, that's right. Well, would you look and see if he's there? Yeah, I'll hold on. Hello? Are you sure? No, that won't do any good. I've gotta talk to him right away. Okay. Well... Well, thanks. Miss Bachrach! Lois Lane's in trouble, and I can't get a hold of Mr. Kent, and the chief's in Boston, so I'm going up there myself. Calm down. I can't calm down, it's an emergency! Look, is the chief's car in the parking lot? Why, yes, I believe so. Okay. I'm gonna take it. [GASPS] Give this note to Mr. Kent. You'll have a nervous breakdown one of these days! Make sure he gets this when he comes in. I'm going out for supper. Okay! I'll leave it on his desk. Oh! That boy! [DOOR CLOSES] She scratched me, that dame. Nail up the back window? Yeah. I don't get this, Mitch. We was good enough to knock off her husband when he tried to spill to the cops, but we ain't good enough to cash in a couple of dames. How's that figure? I don't know, but I don't like waiting around. That Baby Face don't show up soon, we'll do the job and scram. That big gorilla hurt me. I thought he was killing you, the way you screamed. I don't know why they don't kill both of us. Please don't say things like that. [CAR PASSES] You'd think with all those cars going by, one of them would stop. I can't understand it. We always fill up on Friday nights. Get the rope out of the car and tie those dames up. What for? If he ain't here in five minutes, I'm gonna let them have it. The boss will blow his top! Let him blow. How do I know that reporter dame didn't tip off the cops over the phone? Ah, she didn't have no chance. I got her too soon. I know, but I'm playing it safe. In five minutes, we're knocking them off and leaving. Tie them up! I put it right there! Well, it isn't there now. I'm sorry, Mr. Kent, but... Did you read it? Well, I glanced at it. Do you remember what was in it? Well, frankly, I didn't pay much attention! That silly Olsen boy! Never mind about Jim. What was in that note? You don't have to shout at me, Mr. Kent! Oscar! There's something important missing from my office. Well, I don't steal nothing. Of course you didn't. This was an important note. It must have fallen in my wastebasket. Where's the wastepaper from my office? Uh, 28th floor, no? That's right. Over there! Where is 28? It's not there? No! Oh, here it is. I just burn the paper from that one. Uh-oh. I tied them up. Okay. Gonna let them have it? There's a "well" in the name, Mr. Quinn. "Well." W-E-L-L. Is that right? Sleepwell or Deepwell or something like that. Sleepwell or Deepwell or something like that. I'll check through our files, Mr. Kent, and call you back. You're very fortunate I happen to be working late tonight. Thank you, Mr. Quinn. I'll wait in my office. Very well. You got the key? Yeah. Come on, come on. Here. How you got them tied? Back to back. Okay. [ENGINE ROARS, TIRES SQUEAL] Mitch! Mitch! That's him. Baby Face Stevens. Come on. Hiya, Baby Face! Could you fellows tell me where I could find Miss Lane? I think she's in trouble. You see what I mean, Mitch? Always gagging. [LAUGHS] Do you know what cabin she's in? They're in number two, both of them. Here's the key. Oh, gee. Thanks! Wait a minute. You packing a rod? Huh? No rod, huh? How you figure to handle this? I don't know what you mean. Let's kill the gags. The boss likes his jobs done clean. No mess and no fingerprints. I don't know what he's paying you to knock off these two dames but let's get it done fast and clean, huh? Solley, give him your rod. Sure. Hey! You don't need more than one slug for each knockoff, right? Here you are, Baby Face. All set. Two slugs. We'll be watching you. Go ahead. I was wondering whether you'd heard from that man yet. Not yet. [PHONE RINGS] Kent speaking. Who? Mr. Quinn. I've located three tourist camps that have the word "well" in them. Got a pencil? Right. Here they are. The Sleepwell Tourist Camp on Route 33, Willow Falls. That's right. Then there's the Wishing Well Cabins on Route 12 near Three Rivers. Wishing Well Cabins, Route 12, Three Rivers. What? You have another one? All right. [GASPS] Restwell Tourist Cabins, Route 15, Blue Hills. Thank you, Mr. Quinn. Do you want me to call the police and tell them...? No, I'll handle it, Miss Bachrach. Thank you. Oh! He practically pushed me out! Oh! [WIND WHISTLING] Miss Lane! [MUMBLES] Jim, how did you get in here? Shh! Not so loud. They think I'm somebody else, a guy named Baby Face. They gave me this gun and sent me in here to kill you and... Good heavens! Here, let me cut you loose. Did you come alone? I couldn't locate Mr. Kent and the chief's in Boston. Jim, this is Mrs. King. Hello. Come on, Stevens. Get it over with! Golly, what are we gonna do? Make a run for my car. If they try to stop us, shoot them. SOLLEY: What's taking you so long? MITCH: Baby Face! Answer him! Okay! Okay, wait a minute! There's only two bullets in this thing. I never shot one of these guns before in my life! What am I gonna do? I don't know, but we've got to do something! Think, Miss Lane. Think hard. [WIND WHISTLING] I'm looking for a young lady named Lois Lane. Is she here? What's he doing in there? [ENGINE RUMBLES] Who's that? I don't know. The cops? It's only one guy. Get rid of him. If it's Clark in that car, I just hope he had enough sense to bring someone with him. Jim, get ready to shoot that gun off. He's coming this way with that gorilla! It isn't Clark! Should I shoot? No, wait! Hey, Mitch, this guy says he's Baby Face Stevens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Are they in there? Wait a minute, bud. There's another guy in there says he's Baby Face Stevens. How do I know you're the right guy? Here's how. [GRUNTS] Well, do you want my calling card now? No, no. You're Baby Face, all right. Now that we got that settled, you can get up. That guy in there, he's got... He's got Solley's gun. It's got two slugs in it. Leave it to me. We're coming in after you! JIM: You better not, or I'll blow your head off! Here we come! I guess that showed them! Now he's got one bullet left. [GLASS SMASHES] Do you run this place? I said do you run this place? Y-yeah. I'm looking for a young lady named Lois Lane. Is she here? Uh, no. Has she been here? No. Thank you. LOIS: Shoot, Jim, shoot! It's empty! Solley. It's a present for you. [WIND WHISTLING] [CRASH] [THREE GUNSHOTS] Superman, you're wonderful! How did you know we were in trouble? A little bird told me. Bet you the little bird's name was Clark Kent. [LAUGHS] Could be. [♪♪♪]
