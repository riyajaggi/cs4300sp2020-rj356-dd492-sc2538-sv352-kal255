 Alphas (2011â€“2012): Season 2, Episode 11 - If Memory Serves - full transcript 
 It's Midnight Run, Alphas-style as Hicks and Kat transport a valuable Parish asset: a babbling, off-his-nuts memory sponge Alpha named Roland. Roland just might hold the strategic intel they need to stop Parish...if they can outrun and outwit Roland's seemingly indestructible Alpha "caretaker". Meawhile, Rosen is on his own hunt- for Parish' Achilles' Heel, a weak point to strike at. But Senator's Burton sudden presence in the Alphas office threatens to expose Rosen and Nina's own Achillles' Heel.

 - Previously on Alphas... - I have this thing, where I can't remember anything that happened, like, more than a month ago. I want to see if Nina can help you retrieve some memory that your brain has, for whatever reason, buried away. Is there anyone there with you? There's a woman. I think she's my mother. Can no longer send an untrained, and undisciplined, civilian into the field.

 Quantico's FBI Academy. - Oh, thank you! - All right. Bill, Parish somehow managed to coerce Senator Burton to fast-track this photostim through the F.D.A. Every August Medical photostim - has been recalled and destroyed. - Good. Make sure every import ban is retroactive. Of course. We're finished. Charlotte, go home. I've pushed the senator too far. Her doctor needs these brain scans. Look, Nina, it's risky.

 The senator has a lot of resources. She could find you. Unh! What's your relationship to Parish? Unh! Let's go, let's go! Oh! Aah. Aah. Do you know Parish's location? Clear! We're clear! Can you think back to the last time you saw Parish? Relax. And tell me what I need to know. Look at me. Who else is involved? What's Parish planning? When's the last time you saw him? Fresh leads. Take a look. Any insight from you will help us, uh, prioritize. Nathan, don't you think this approach is a scattershot, really? We're hitting the Parish organization from every angle. We've got analysts working 24/7. We've got all the resources we could want. This place is like the friggin' bin Laden desk now. Yeah, and that took ten years. But we got him. Anything jump out? Uh, no. No, uh, not at the moment. Sorry. There's more where that came from. Cameron, there's a farmhouse at this address. If there's anything there that can lead us to Parish, we need to get to it... before the investigation. So you don't trust Cley's people? No, I don't. We both know how Parish can twist people's loyalties. Okay. The place is only a few hours away. As much as I'd like to go with you, I'm afraid my sudden departure from here would garner more attention than I'd like. But you will, however, need some backup. Someone who won't be missed. Yes! It's my first recon mission. Mm. Uh, yay, high five. - Um... - yes! But there's a little more involved than just reconnaissance, Kat. Okay. All ears. Quantico-trained ears. Mr. Hicks is grieving. So I'm counting on you to keep him focused on the task at hand. Yeah, of course. Dr. Rosen. The factory in China, the one that made the photic stimulators... - Yeah. - For Stanton Parish? They ju...I just got a ping. They exported something to New York. But I-I don't know what it was. But Senator Burton shut down August Medical. Oh, yeah, no, but it's not August Medical anymore. Gary, will you try and discover what's been exported? I, yeah, no, I was gonna do that anyway. That's...even if you didn't ask me. That's my hot lead. Oh, Bill? Yeah. Can you give me a ride to the hospital after work? Gary, why do you need to go to the hospital? Oh, 'cause my mom was in a car accident. Okay, first post-Quantico mission, and I'm totally psyched. Again with the video diary. I'm all geared up. I've got guns, tech gear, snacks, and I've memorized the topography within a 50-mile radius. They're leaving. Unsub leaving the premises. Matches profile described by locals. Total badass. Loner, ex-military type. I'm forced to make an evaluation by eye 'cause Hicks is bogarting the binoculars that I brought. All right. Let's see what's so special about this place. Remember to check your danger areas upon entry. Show me your hands! Right now. Oh. Did I... Did I ever tell you about the time I met John McEnroe? In Malibu, on the beach. He...he's a lot nicer than you'd think. We...we still keep in touch. What? I liberated Buchenwald! All right, not... not all by myself. And if you guys are hungry, I-I can whip up a little something. I studied, uh, at Cordon Bleu. La cuisine salon. Hey, what's your name? Your name! Uh, uh, Mitchell. Okay, Mitchell. Now why are you locked in this room? I have to be here. I'm...I'm very important. Yeah? Says who? Um... Stanton Parish.

So, the scale in the bathroom is broken, and there's a butt load of empty milk cartons in the trash, but besides that... only thing out of the ordinary is this guy. First time I saw the boss was spring of '72 at the Stone Pony. The Boss? What do you mean, Parish? Springsteen. The guy still puts on a hell of a show. Pretty sure this dude's cheese has slid off his cracker. Did I tell you that I burst in on Mitchell with a gun in my hand and a cute blonde at my side? Wait a minute, that wasn't you, that was me. What do you mean, "at my side"? Since when did I turn into Tonto? If Parish is keeping him locked in that farmhouse, he must be important. Hey, Hicks. That massive jailer dude could be back at any time. Yeah, Doc, we gotta move. Bring him in quickly. And quietly. All right. Let's go. I don't have my keys. Have you seen my keys? Dr. Rosen. Senator Charlotte Burton. I'll be acting as the senate liaison to the Parish task force. Yes, of course. Uh, please, come in. Thank you. A lead? Uh, one of hundreds. We're literally drowning in leads. Senator? Yes. My question to you, where is Parish vulnerable? What are his weaknesses? Well, if...if he has any, he's, uh, he's playing them very close to his vest. Don't we all? But everyone has an Achilles' heel, Dr. Rosen. Now, I'd like to be brought up to speed. Uh, yes. Yes, of course. Let me show you to the conference room. Uh, Dr. Rosen... I know what you did. I asked around about your research, and I don't think those medical files could have come from anywhere else. If those brain scans hadn't found their way to my neurologist, I'm not sure I'd be here today. I owe you my life. Nina, you went behind my back, and provided her with a paper trail which she has followed directly to me. I saved her. Lee, I know you. You don't want her blood on our hands. It's not her blood I'm concerned about. It's if...when she puts the pieces together, you and I could go to jail. Send her home. Push her? But I don't know what that would do to her. We have other concerns right now. So, what, she's an acceptable casualty? All right, then you leave. I'm in the middle of interrogations right now. We don't know if her seeing you is gonna trigger her memory, and that's a risk I'm not willing to take. Now, as soon as I can figure out a way to move her off the investigation, I will let you know. Bill, I don't like it here. I-I don't...last time I was in a hospital, I lost Anna again. I don't...I don't want to stay here. I understand, Gary. Look, no one likes hospitals, okay? - Yeah, I know. - Including your mother. No, no, they... she's still in surgery, okay? Yeah, so...yeah, she's unconscious, then. She doesn't even know that I'm here. Come on, let's go back to the office. - No, okay? - Come on, Bill. I have a hot lead. All right, well, then work from here. I can't- No, Bill! I can't work from here. - Gar... - I don't like it. We've been over this already. Gary, will you please chill, okay? I'm-no, I don't want to chill. Gary, just chill and have a seat, please. I don't want to chill out, Bill. Look, I'm sorry, all right? I just... I've been up half the night with Jeannie, driving Adam around. Oh. But he's a baby. He doesn't have anywhere to go. No, I know. I could...I... oh, no, that's it, Bill. I found it. The shipment that arrives in New York from Stanton Parish's factory. Oh, shh, shh, shh. This is it, the manifest. It says "industrial electronics." That's it. We're gonna need more details, okay? Yeah. - Anything on the factory? - Yeah, it's all here, Bill. But I-I can't read it. Neither can you. It's all in Chinese. I was calm as we approached the farmhouse, sliding into danger as if it were a pair of fuzzy slippers. Hicks, however, was a wreck. Reeked of fear. And the breakfast burrito he ate a couple of hours ago. I was calm as we approached the farmhouse. Come on, Hicks. Why don't we talk anymore? We used to talk. Did we have some torrid sexual affair I'm not remembering, or, what's the deal? You want to talk about sex, I was stationed in the Philippines in the second World War. If you two don't shut the hell up, I swear to God I will crash this car and I will kill us all. You got it? Look, I'm sorry about Dani. If you want to talk about... I don't. Dani is dead. I'm responsible for her death. I-I killed Dani. What the hell did you say? Hicks, do something! Unh! He's dead. Yeah, so is the car. Come on. We gotta get off the road. If that guy called for back up, we're in trouble. Unh! - We've gotta call Rosen. - We're out of cell range. We're too far off the grid. I...I don't have my keys. - I-I can't find my keys. - You don't have any keys. People locked in rooms aren't usually given keys. Am I going home soon? No, you're not going home soon! Look, we need to keep moving. There could be a battalion of... - No! You are gonna tell me... - Badasses after us. How you are responsible for Dani's death. And then I put my gun on Mitchell, and...and... and the prisoner looked really scared. Hicks, you can't shoot the prisoner. They didn't exactly teach us that at the academy, - but it was totally implied. - Well I didn't go to the academy, so you tell me about Dani. About Dani. I, um, wanted to be straight with you. I want to be with him. I appreciate your candor. You deserve to be happy, as does Mr. Hicks. Don't you ever do that to me again! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What just happened? He just put me with Dani. I'm not following, Hicks. It was like it was in a memory, all right? But it wasn't mine! Okay, then whose memory was it? I got a pretty good idea. Gary's list from the factory, translated. All the industrial electronics have basically the same components as the photostim. The one used on Jason and me. So Parish is still looking for a way to amplify Alpha abilities. Apparently so. It's critical we intercept the shipment before it gets to Parish. I was gonna walk back to the office. But Google maps said that it... it would take 3 hours, 18 minutes. I'm not built for that. No, you're not. I imagine this is pretty hard for you, huh? Yeah. You know what this is like? Remember... remember when you had Adam? And he's just a helpless little baby? Yeah. Yeah, of course. - It wasn't even that long ago. - Yeah. I've got a good memory, Bill. - Well... - I'm not a cat. Well, that's exactly how your mother feels, okay? So, it's your turn to look after her. It's only right, partner. All right? All right? Yeah, Harken. Okay. I'll be right there. Gary, I've got to go back to the office. That was Rosen. I'll be back as soon as I can. You okay? Gary, are you okay? That's...that's good. You okay? How does he do that, huh? Put me in someone else's memory? Well, I'm guessing he's an Alpha. Oh, really, you think? Hey, can you mess with the cortisol levels in people's hippocampus? Because that would totally affect people's memory reconsolidation. I'm lactose intolerant. I mean, once slice of cheese and look out. Yep. I don't think he would understand what you were saying, even if you did say it in English. Would you like me... Yeah, I'd love to hear it in English, thank you. So, he touches you, right? And zap, he records whatever memory you're thinking about. And then he touches you later, and he put you back in, only in HD smell-and-touch-o-vision. Isn't that right, Mitch? Uh, right. So he's a Total Recall Alpha. - I don't... - It's a movie. Okay, I'll put it at the top of my queue. Look, I'm guessing he can put you back in any memory he's got stored in his head. Doesn't even have to be your own. Pretty cool toy to keep around. So if he's holding Parish's memories, he must be a mountain of intel. I'm good for it. We're still out of cell range. I memorized the cell coverage in this area. You're not gonna get squat until we get back into town. Okay, well which is the quickest way to town? Is it this way? No, the quickest way is to flag a car down and flash our badges, but... Under the radar, Kat. No badge-flashing, huh? No having to explain to the local sheriff why we killed a man, or why we've got this babbling idiot in cuffs. I have to go home now. If I wander off, the caretaker will come for me. I don't think you need to worry about the Terminator, pal. - Eh... - Another movie thing. Put it in your queue. They can break my bones, but I will always mend! What are you... he can recover from a broken neck? I'm your caretaker now. And I will always keep you safe, no matter what. So do you think Parish is the one who's lactose intolerant? Well, every Alpha has a downside. Maybe we finally found his. Look at you making jokes. Maybe memory is his downside. I mean, think about it. Why else would he keep an Alpha journal around unless his memory was slipping? Right before my grandpa kicked it, he used to call me by the cat's name. He was 70. Parish is over 200 years old. Have you guys seen my keys? I-I can't find my keys. Yeah, grandpa used to say that too. Look at you, smiling. Don't hurt yourself. I'm sorry. Jeez, I suck at this. Hey, look. Thinking about Dani is... it's messing you up. So maybe, you know, you should just stop. - Or... - Just stop. Yeah. You...you'll feel much better, if you just stop thinking about her. Man, you really don't get it, do you? And for you, all you do is forget. So, tell you what. Come on, teach me. I wish I could. Um... I can help you. I can put you inside your memories of Dani. Shut the hell up, Mitchell. Hey! Hey, come on. Here's the town. At least I don't suck at directions. Okay, so... You remember, obviously, by rewiring here and here, Skylar increased the power. Yeah, and made the effect of this device instantaneous, as you know. Well, yeah, how could I forget? Okay, so take a look. If you combine all the components of that factory shipment together, you could end up with a device that could replicate Skylar's power boost. And conceivably increase the ability of hundreds of Alphas, all of whom believe in Parish's cause. I got this. So, I'll hotwire a car. We'll be back in Manhattan in time for Jeopardy! Yeah, we could drive a stolen car back to the city. Or I could just head over there and rent one. Ah! That's why I keep you around. Always thinking. Just keep him out of sight, all right? Okay, come on. Let's go. Get down. When am I going home? Um, you're gonna get a new home, I assume. Can't give you all the details, 'cause it's above my pay grade, but I'm sure it's gonna be... Awesome. Who is she? Why can't I remember? I can help you, too. With a memory. If you want. Um, no, thanks. I'm kind of a hard nut to crack in that department. Are you sure? There was a woman in a blue dress. I think she might be my mom. Well, if she's in there, I can help you find her. Clorera has never let me down. Clorera has the strength to clean up life's messes. Big and small. What the hell was that? Where's the rest of it? I'm sorry, that's all there is. No. No, that can't be it. That can't be all I have. I'm sorry. I really am. I don't have anything. I can't even remember which are my memories anymore. Ms. Theroux. I'd like to talk. I'm sorry, I'm... I'm just going home. I spoke to Agent Cley about you. He said that you can put thoughts in people's minds. Make them do things. I'm not feeling very well. I need to go. Do they remember what you did? Why do you ask, senator? Because I've been pushed. At first I thought I was losing my mind. But when Parish's attack came to light, I thought an Alpha could be responsible for my... experience. An Alpha like you. I joined the task force because I need answers. I need to know if I was pushed by one of Parish's people. - By one of Parish's... - I'm questioning everything. Is what I'm doing my decision, or someone else's? I just want to trust myself again. You can. The person who did this to you isn't in control of you anymore. Your mind is yours. How can you be sure? I really need to go home. Charlotte... Go home. You. God, I hate the smell of the docks. Must be worse for you, huh? Actually, it's not bothering me. I think I've come to a Zen place with my senses. It's like I've finally found a balance between everything... Between what? Sex and what? I know you're having sex. - That is none of your business. - Yeah. Uh-huh. The manifest says industrial electronics. It hasn't been inspected yet. It hasn't been touched since it arrived yesterday. Still sealed. Maritime's gone for the day. There's nobody here to open this can for you. We could try a chop... We got this. Thanks. There are patterns in the dust. The boxes were here. Thousands of them. He has them. Parish already has them. Now, where did he take them? Okay, I'll do it. Do what, sweetheart? I'll come home, and look after you. But I have a new schedule now. And I have... I have pudding every day. We have to go and buy a load of pudding. 'Cause I have... I have it every afternoon. I should be having some right now, but I'm here looking after you. We'll make it work. I'm...I'm glad you're here. Oh, yeah, you're welcome. Is it? Hey. Hey, look. Oh, wait. You're attached. There's a thing. - That's a step, right there. - Whoa! The...oh. Yeah. It... It's banana. No banana? I like blueberry. Well, I'm... I'm sure if we ask the nurse, we can... soo...szzah... No, I-I don't... Szzsahzz... Oh. Oh, Mom? Mom? Hey, Doctor. Mrs. Bell. - Is she okay? - Mrs. Bell, can you hear me? She was just... she was awake. Talking to me. Can you hear me, Mrs.- Mrs. Bell, you're in the hospital. Can you say that for me? Probably a C.V.A. Okay, get her on 94% O2, all right? Page I.R. and tell them to prepare for angio and T.P.A. What is all that stuff? And get him out of here, please? - I'm sorry, you have to go. - Excuse me...what...no, no. Oh...what are those things? Is she okay, though? She was just... she was just awake. - Just hang in there. Hang tough a little longer now. Stay with me. I know you don't approve. But she was living in fear because of what we did to her. I couldn't leave her like that. It's better that she's scared of me than scared of herself. Better? Nina, you of all people know that fear can make people do all sorts of unpredictable things. Letting her know was the right thing to do. All right, I'll...I'll reach out to her and see what I can do to smooth things over. This is the person you wanted me to be. Dr. Rosen, Agent Cley needs you to take a... Not now. Excuse us. I need to speak with Dr. Rosen. I just finished combing through a raft of documents regarding the unconstitutional actions of your team. I believe the Attorney General will be extremely interested. Yes, I can imagine he would be. Your team is more dangerous than the Alphas they go after. And you? You are the worst. You use them to assault innocents under a pretense of justice. Senator Burton, I apologize for pushing you. I can assure you, we don't do that without a lot of consideration. But the other option was to blackmail you, with the illegal contribution to your first campaign, or that you had been compromised by Parish's organization in regards to August Medical. So I decided to have Nina push you, because I thought that was the gentler of the options. And I'd like to think that I won't regret that choice. And, uh, yes, Senator, you are right. My team is dangerous. And so am I. Hey, Kat, I got the car, so, uh... Look, just meet me where I left you off, all right? Aah! Where is he? Hicks, you ready? Let's trade. Oh, crap. Uh, look... Mr. Caretaker, I'm not really authorized to make deals. Well you've got five minutes to figure it out. I need to call you back. Shoot. Okay, Mitchell, I need you to focus. You're the caretaker. How do you do your thing? - I'm your caretaker now. - Mm-hmm. And I will always keep you safe. Yeah, got that. I need the other side of the coin. The downside. How many times have I told you not to drink my milk, Mitchell? Your system can't handle it. Milk cartons. Okay, he needs a ton of calcium to help him heal. Which means his osteoblasts would increase his bone density like crazy. Hey, Caretaker? Did you break a bathroom scale while you were healing? Do you get, like, super heavy? Have I ever told you about the time I met McEnroe? In Malibu. Super nice guy. - Yeah, you did. - Where are my keys? Okay, let's swap. I'll text you a longitude and latitude. - Oh, so now you're in charge? - Yeah, I pick the location, - 'cause I have the leverage. - How do you figure? Well, if I lose Hicks, I get yelled at. If you lose Mitchell, I'm guessing you get a painful death. I really hope I know how to drive one of those things. How's your mom? She had another stroke. She had a little stroke, and that's why she crashed the car. Because normally she's a good driver. And then...but now she had the bigger stroke. And she's unconscious, and the doctor doesn't know when she's gonna wake up again. Are you okay? Yeah, of course I'm okay, Bill. I didn't have a stroke. Hey, Mitchell! Hey, Mitchell! Mitchell. Where you been, man? I-I don't know if I ever told you this, but, uh... I actually used to run a fishing boat out of these very waters. Mitchell, where's the girl you were with? Concentrate on the present. The girl you were just with. Where is she? She drove off. She told me to walk. You know, these waters are pretty deep, and I used to high dive in water that was... that was shallower than this. Mitchell, don't go near the water! Hicks? Hicks! Oh, crap. He's in the trunk, isn't he? Hand me that rock. Don't go near the water, Mitchell. Quit flailing. You seriously don't know how to swim? I'm sorry. I was too busy learning how to pick locks under water. How'd you know the caretaker would sink? He's too heavy. He's... when he's healing, his bone density weighs him down. Remember the milk and the broken scale? - Yeah. - It's a science thing. Come on. Hello, Mitchell. I'm Dr. Lee Rosen. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance. Dr. Rosen. He's an arrogant bastard, but I like him. Those are Stanton Parish's words, aren't they? Can you show me, um, uh... the last time you spoke with Mr. Parish? I must never forget what I'm feeling right now. I've lost another someone who was very dear to me. Dani is dead. I'm responsible for her death. I killed her. I sacrificed her. Well, I'm sure it was for a good reason. You always make the right decision. That's what you told me. Did I? Did I say that? Yeah. Yes. Well, I wish it were true. I don't think I did. No, not this time. If I could have that moment back. I can't let her death be for nothing, can I? I refuse to fail. Fail? You're all I have left now, Mitchell. I promise you, you will grow old in a better world than I have. This farmhouse is my home. I built it with my father. It's where I raised my first family in. Really, it's still the only place I feel at home. Those are my memories, Mitchell. Clorera has the strength to clean up life's messes. May I? Hey, Kat, it's your old buddy, Cam Hicks. And I just wanted to say, for the record, thanks for saving my life today, but you are the most annoying person in the world to take a road trip with. Hey. What I said before, about if I could help you forget, I would? I wouldn't. You okay? Yeah, I'm great. Turns out the only memory I have of my life is some stupid commercial with this stupid actress. Look, you're lucky to have your memories. Even the ones that hurt. They let you know who you are. Well... I know who you are. You are the girl who can drive a rig, and can pick a lock underwater. I don't know if I have the stomach for this. Come on, you're an ace. That guy. I killed him, and I don't like how it feels. - That was justified. - Yeah, was it? I mean, he was just doing his job. Just trying to protect Mitchell. I killed a man today, and I don't ever want to forget how that feels. So? You get Parish's plans? No, Cameron, I didn't. It seems that Parish doesn't use him in that way. He talks to Mitchell about his feelings. Entire operation's a bust. No. No, it's not. Quite the contrary. I learned quite a bit in there. I learned that, uh, I have misjudged Mr. Parish. He is not a sociopath. He cares quite deeply about this young man, and he cares quite deeply about Dani. And this humanity of his makes him vulnerable. That's his weakness. And we are going to use it against him. I don't have my keys. Here. I was holding 'em for you. Mitchell didn't do anything wrong. He doesn't deserve to be there. I know. But Building Seven might very well be the best thing for him. At least his mind will be at peace there. Either way, you're not gonna lose any sleep over it, are you? Sleep? What's that? Cameron, Mitchell is nothing more than a thread to be pulled, and Parish will unravel. Parish won't let you keep Mitchell chipped. He'll come for him. Let him come. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
