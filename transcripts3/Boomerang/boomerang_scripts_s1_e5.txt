 What're you up to today, mother-in-law? More importantly, what are you doing? Job-hunting, maybe? It'd be nice if someone went shopping. Someone with nothing else to do. Don't throw it out! It's 2 days out of date. Best before dates are like amber traffic lights. If you hurry, you're OK. - That was in the bin! - It's still good. I can't stand waste.

 Bins are better fed than 60% of Montrealers. Don't ask why so many people go through shop and restaurant bins. At our restaurant, we had Claudio, the waste man. He did all his shopping by going through the bins. Regional cuisine, garbage cuisine, I've seen it all! Out the way. Clear it up. Sorry. Yes, sir! Waste. I can't bear it. Where d'you think you're going?

 We're off to play 18 holes and discuss... My future. We'll discuss my future. No. Yesterday, you promised me you'd finish painting the office. Your furniture and boxes have been in my office for 6 months now! - We'll do it when we get back. - No! We're discussing my future! Help your father, then! Discuss your future while you paint. It takes 2 hours to paint it all! We'll do it after golf. No! No! 2 hours, that's good: after the painting, you could go shopping. We only have capers and peanut butter. Come with me. Look how fine the weather is. - It's too good for painting! - Yes. We have all weekend to do that. For 6 months you've found 1,000 reasons not to do it. Want to help her find herself? Set an example! Teach her to finish what she starts. "Finish "what I start"?! Look, Karine, you know I love you. But your CV's 48 pages long, divided into 3 volumes, including a section on uni courses you started. - It's not that bad! - Your mum's saying you're indecisive, you struggle to finish things. You did 1,000 courses without finishing 1! A bit thinly spread. I haven't spread myself too thin, I'm eclectic! I'm not indecisive, I'm multi-skilled. 50-odd vehicles, turnover of 9 million. Wow! They're coming at 5. I'll charm 'em. They'll sign. Very good. Patrick. Richard. You enjoy washing up. Great! Your tie's too tight: air's not reaching your brain. The contract's ready. Think of something nice: wine, sushi... MY PA will buy some nice trays. No, no, no! You can't serve supermarket sushi! If you want, I can make some elegant hors-d'œuvres: to hook them. This is a big contract and I want it. I won Kitchen Stars. Gino Chouinard visited my restaurant on his show. The place that went bust? I appreciate what you've done for Karine and me. Let me do something for you. OK, then. You won't regret it. Buy what you need. Hang on! We're paying for the favour he's doing us? No, of course not... Monique, keep it. It's my shout. You won't be late? It's at 5pm. Leave it to the pro. No need to thank me. Just seeing the lovely smile on your face is all the gratitude I need. Don't touch me. We'll be done by midday. It'd be great if we knocked that wall down. A reading corner, bookshelves... Ah yes... - Yes. - A double room. See, when it's open: nice space for a reading corner, with nice cushions. Have a long bench seat you can open and put things in, some alcoves here and some nice bookshelves. I could put my sound system here so I can listen to my music. Now's the time. Put it in before we paint. I'll call Sylvain. I wanted to turn my office into a smart room you can control with your phone: the lights... Fuck, fuck, fuck... - Hi, man. - Hi. I might be in the shit. Sylvain? - Yes? - Yes. OK. I thought you were just painting. We're turning my office into a smart room. Monique'll find it "smart". Home automation is in. I'll show you the model I found. It'll be cool. Oh, my god! Oh no! The carpet! Oh, my God! Oh dear... Don't worry. I hate that carpet. It's full of mites. We'd better rip it out before we paint. - Wooden floorboards? - No, plywood. - Not good. - The in-thing is grey maple. - Really? - Yes. - Is it dear? - I dunno. Go to the DIY shop, Pat. I've got canapés to make. I need your keys, Sylvain. Thanks. Alright, good luck! Let's rip out the carpet. - Start by... - Ripping everything out. - Provolone? - Check. Good. Basil? What type? I'll take 'em all. Fennel? Triple check. And cherry tomatoes. How many? Great. I can't believe it. All that from bins? You should see what folk chuck. Your lucky day. - A lovely box of macaroons. - Alright! Thanks, Claudio. You're a saviour. OK. I'd better get going. I'll install a control for you. You'll be able to control it all from your iPhone. You can be in your car and turn the house heating on. Really? I'll have to buy a new mobile. Excuse me. It's work. I'd better take it. Sylvain Lafleur. - Ever put a floor in? - No. - No? - No. Mum will kill you! - I'll say it was your idea. - No. We've read your dossier. We can make you a tempting offer. We have access to products... I told you he'd be late. - I arranged backup. - Yes. We're not attached to a specific insurer, so we can access all insurance... ...varied. - Evening, gents. - Mrs Bernier. - Evening. - Richard. - Patrick. I hope you're hungry. I'll just move this. Here we go. To start, radish, cucumber and fennel salad with a tangy dressing, blinis, goats' cheese and prosciutto, melon. And some tomato and broccoli bites. I recognise your face. Have we met? I don't think so. As I was saying, we've negotiated a special... I know... - You were on Kitchen Stars. - Yes. That's me. I'll get the rest? Good idea! Can I do a photo? Maybe we can... - Mrs Bernier, is it... - Yes. Yes, of course. OK. With pleasure. Cool! When I tell my girl, she'll go crazy. Cheers, guys. - Thanks. - Enjoy the food. I've got more to bring out. OK for you, Ricky? Yes. He's great. - You were saying? - Yes. - So, what was I saying? - I was talking. OK, thanks. He'll do the floor for 20 dollars an hour. He did the floors in our restaurant. Yeah? What time's he here? In a month. You're in deep trouble. Your mother was right when she said we should both be on Ritalin. I gotta get back to the gym. But there's holes all over! My receptionist resigned without warning. I must find someone. What you doing tomorrow? I can help you out. It's not as if I'm doing anything. - What about the wiring? - See you tomorrow at 6.30am. OK? My wiring... Great success. Your mum's so happy and Richard's so vexed. I'm so pleased for you, but was it a good idea doing a luxury buffet? We're skint. It cost nothing. I called Claudio. All the food's from bins. All of it! Cool. - I beg your pardon? - I'll call you back. OK? If you still want to be able to have kids, tell me you didn't make the canapés from binned food. Monique, as I told you earlier, best before dates are just... Monique, come on! Don't get upset. Monique, everyone loves my canapés. Don't panic. Eh? - Right... - What was in those? Only the finest ingredients. Why? Are you alright? Patrick, bring Mr Dupré some water. Let's discuss the contract. As regards public liability, you're covered in case of error, omission, negligence... - Oh shit! - Oh fuck! Here's the water. Shit, he's not well! He poisoned them! He poisoned our clients! My food didn't cause this! You OK, Mr Dupré? We shouldn't have trusted him! Richard, shut up! Call an ambulance! Mr Dupré, it's going to be OK. What're you doing? You feed him rat then you pick his pockets! - No, Patrick! - I've got it! It's OK, Mr Dupré. It'll be OK. Richard, is the ambulance coming? Or we'll take him ourselves! You saved his life. I'm allergic to wasp stings. I've been doing this since I was 5. Breathe. Breathe. Stay with us. We're here. See? At least I've got a job. Receptionist at a gym. 1 dollar more than minimum wage. So... hooray! I've got a job. Nothing to say? Well done, Karine. You have a job. Don't be too enthusiastic. - You shock me sometimes. - What? You shock me. Is that it?! Receptionist at a gym? A dirty towels attendant? Answering the phone? - It's a stopgap! - Stopgap... Karine! You're 34 years old. Sorry, but if you want to do what you love in life, then get on with it. I'm a chip off the old block. Forget all that! You're a brilliant girl, you have such a big heart. You're much more sophisticated than you make out. And you have tons of energy. But you get discouraged at the 1st obstacle you meet. When Patrick got into trouble with the restaurant, you moved heaven and earth to help him. You never gave up until you hit a brick wall. Why can't you give the same energy when it's about you? Because... it's not that simple. You want it to be "simple"? What do you want, Karine? That's the question. The only one. I can't have what I want. I thought you might find a reason to drop this, but not so quickly. I'll say, but you won't like it. Ah, OK. Try me. Well... Even if all my food had come from a shop, he'd still have had that reaction: he's allergic. It's your job as a chef to ask about that! Er... no. It's not my job to ask about it. You think we ask everyone at every table who's allergic to what? - Don't dare... - But for your information, I asked your assistant to ask that question. Dupré's allergic to seafood: there's none in my canapés. Then your face caused his anaphylactic shock! Enough, guys! What? Rummaging through bins again, is he?! What? "Nam pla"! Here, "nam pla"! Sorry, I don't understand morons. There's nam pla in the nibbles you bought. Right here!! Who's the moron now?! So what? Richard, nam pla is Thai fish sauce. Perhaps "I'm sorry, Pat" might be in order. Pigs will fly before... - Richard. - Richard... I'm not asking you to kneel before me. I'm listening. - We have to take risks. - Exactly. To dare. Hey, Mum! Why? Look, the plan changed as we went along. Yes. It's going to be a big, multifunctional smart room. "A big smart room" that I'll control from my iPhone. All the wiring will be in the walls. - Yes. It's... - Eventually. We've worked really hard. Look at it. We've opened it right up. Is this... all you've done the entire day? Ah no. Not just this. No. We made some big decisions. Really big. "Really big". Bigger than this? Oh yes. Dad helped me see the light. I've decided what I'm gonna do. - No? - Yep. I'm going back to university! No? Wow! What great news! Yes! - Alright! - Oh, my God! I'm so happy! Yes, ma'am! Our daughter's going to university! You'll kick ass! The solution was so obvious. It was obvious, but Dad made me see it when he said: "To have what you want in life, "you have to know "what you want." It's "knowledge". Spot on, father-in-law! That was the trigger. - "University"? - Yes. Fine. Oh, my God! I hope I won't be too old. Never. Let's do it! Doing what? Eh? What will you study? What department, what course, what qualification? I haven't decided yet. One thing at a time. Let's take it a day at a time, eh? But you're going to university. Karine rules! I was like... "That's it!" Karine! Karine! Karine! Karine! I'm the only adult here. I'm so lonely... I know someone who needs a group hug! No! Patrick! Group hug! Look, it's not complicated, you're a groper. Understand? You like feeling people up. You probably come from a family of touchy-feely gropers. I hate that. Subtitles: Eclair Media
