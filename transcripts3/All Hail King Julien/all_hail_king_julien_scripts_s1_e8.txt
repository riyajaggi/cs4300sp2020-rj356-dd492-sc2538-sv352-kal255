 Oh, very nimble for so much junk in his trunk. ♪ {\i1} Groove now, everybody{\i0} ♪ Hey! ♪ {\i1}Everybody {\i0} ♪ [screams] [laughter] Uh, how long have y'all been there? Maurice, why do you sound so mopey? Do you not see how many fanboys you have made today by letting your freaky flag fly? It's not funny! I agree. It's not funny. It's hilarious! [laughs] Hey, look! I'm Maurice! I'm smacking my butt cheek! [laughter] [growls] [both gasp] I wonder what has gotten into him. Mmm? {\i1}♪ Everybody ♪{\i0} {\i1}♪ Everybody ♪{\i0} {\i1}♪ Everybody groove, now ♪{\i0} Hmm? In memory of our fallen leader, Banana Guy Mike, we will liberate all of the lemurs from the tyranny of King Julien, and continue to spread the good word, "LALA." Right! What's that stand for again? You remember! It's just like what Banana Guy Mike said... The Lemur Alliance Liberation Army. Or LALA for short. [both sigh] - Hello! - [both yell] If we stay real still, he might think we're statues. Whatcha doing? Being a statue. Shut up, Abner. I like your art. Oh... yeah... art! Right. We're, uh, beautifyin' the kingdom. And definitely not trying to brainwash anyone into overthrowing the government with us. Ugh! Can I help? Sidebar, Abner? Sidebar, Becca. What do you think? You mean like my musings about this crazy thing called life or you talking more specific? What the H-E-double C-K is that? You painted that? Yeah, you know. Just a little doodle. I think I feel a plan forming. Sidebar, Abner? Sidebar, Becca. You see how great that painting he just did was? I don't know about great. Kinda gave me a lazy eye. I'm thinking we could use an artsy fartsy type like him, to help us spread our message of peace, love, and destroying the corrupt monarchy. It would be nice to have a few more members to join our noble rebellion. We'd like to invite you to check out our... art club. Next meeting's this afternoon. Snacks will be served. Wow. Snacks are my favorite food! JULIEN: I still do not understand why you have the angries, Maurice. I "have the angries," because now everybody in the kingdom is talking and laughing about my dancing. What is the problem? You're famous and everyone thinks you're funny. [clank] Can't be that bad. [laughter] This is happening everywhere I go. I can't even leave the plane, and it's your fault! - [clank] - Eh? Maurice? Mo-mo? If we're going to be fighting like this, I should really be standing in first class and you in coach, but... what can I do to make whatever this is better? You can apologize. Eh, besides that. One of the first lessons Uncle King Julien taught me is that a king must never apologize. Really? He never apologized? He attacked the wrong kingdom once, did he apologize? N-O. Because that would be like recognizing he made a mistake. Fell better now? Mm? Masikura, back me up. [yells] It is true, your uncle did not apologize, howev... [stammers] Thank you, Masikura. You may disappear. You're saying because you're the king, now you can't apologize to your best friends? Yes, exactly. [laughs] I was so worried I was not getting through to you. [grunts] It would be wise to tell him you're sorry. Apologies are the manure that fertilizes the flower of friendship. Wow. Uh, way to sell it, Masikura. You know what, you can keep your poopy flowers I will come up with a better plan. Ugh. I already do not like where this is going. What is this thing supposed to be again? I call it my "Shame Spiral." I know what you are thinking. How does he do it? [laughs, snorts] How do you create shame? Well, taking a cue from my mother, who was the shame ninja of ten rec guilt... Cut to the chase, Schizard. What? Oh, uh, long story short, I use humiliating experiences from my own childhood to build a state of the art apparatus that will run King Julien through a gauntlet of classic slapstick pratfalls, inducing laughter among observers. Making me, King Julien, look like a big dumb idiot so Maurice will forgive me. Heh, I'd love to see how this turns out, but I should go, um... secure the perimeter. Not 'cause I'm trying to get away from... whatever this is. But because duty and... service... On it! So glad you could make it. Here, come talk with me, while I stand on this completely random spot. What's everybody doing here? [laughs] You're so funny. Who's to say? Maybe they are here to see me embarrassed in front of the whole kingdom. [clicking] Ahem. I said, embarrassed in front of the whole kingdom! Uh, King Julien? Ah, here's the problem. Huh? Huh? [yells] [groans, grunting] Come on! [grunting continues] [yells] [screams] [yelps] - [Maurice grunting] - [crowd laughing] [groans] [laughter] Shh. No! Everyone stop laughing right now. Maurice is very sensitive... [stifled laughter] This is not funny! [laughs] Okay, it's a little funny. [laughs] Oh, man! I'm glad that wasn't me! Look at his face! Look at... He's a clown! He's a lemur clown! [laughter] JULIEN: And the honey! It's a sweet mess. [grunts] Vandalism. Yes! Something to investigate! I mean, sure, I'd prefer aggravated assault, but beggars can't be choosers. BECCA: Hmm. Dang, that's pretty good! A fist raised in defiance of tyranny. How'd ya come up with such a powerful image? I have funny fruit dreams. That's a banana hand. I just wish Banana Guy Mike were here to see this. Yeah, RIP, BGM. SMH. S-M-H. Ahem. I was promised snacks. Right on. Almost forgot. [grunts] Ah. Ooh! [loud eating] You guys don't have fruit? [gulps] You want fruit? We're up to our ears in these stupid pok-pok berries. Got a big tree outside that provides all the nutrition we'd ever need. It's awful! Ew! Nutrition! Gross. Unfortunately, they're delicious. Mmm! That don't mean we shouldn't be free to eat random garbage food that washes up on the beach. The man wants to mind control us by making us eat food the government says is safe and probably won't kill us. Uh-uh. That ain't right! No, it ain't. We eat what we want. And what we want is, well, looks like it's either dog food or food made out of dog. Either way, it's our sky-god's given right to eat it. And we're sticking it to the government by shoving it in our pie holes. Yay! Fight the power! [gobbles] Mmm! Savory. Complex. With a smoky finish. [loud eating] That little fella's hungry for freedom. And possibly dog meat. I think he's ready for the truth. Mm-hmm. Mort? - Mort! - [yells] We gotta come clean. Despite our worldly sophistication, we ain't really an art club. We're revolutionaries. Fighting the man, over throwing the government. You interested? Yes! I hate the man already. Then welcome aboard, son. You know, Abner? I'm feeling a big ol' brainstorm a-brewing. Swirling like a dang tornado. Well, let it out before you hurt yourself! We take this... Mm, I like where this is headed. Mm-hmm. And make it bigger! Big enough for everybody to see and be motivated to action. Heck, I'm motivated already just hearing about it. What do you think, Mort? I've always wanted to share my beauty with the... [vomits] Oh, I ate too much dog meat. JULIEN: I do not know what I should do about Maurice. It would be easy to tell him I'm sorry. But would it be kingly? C'mon, drop some knowledge on me. I really miss hanging with my best bud. I thought of a funny noise today and didn't have anyone to annoy with it. You want to hear it? Here it go... [loud noises] Maybe I should just tell him I'm sorry... No, you're right. A great king cannot let his squishy inner feelings get in the way. Oh, Amelia, so glad we had this talk before I did something stupid, like make things right with my best friend. Clover! Great timing. I just wrapped up a meeting. I found this on perimeter duty. Someone's been using it to deface government property. "Deface?" It means vandalize. - Vande... - They're painting on stuff. Painting on stuff? That sounds... illegal? Okay, yeah. I'm outraged! I don't know what it all means yet, but I've been seeing "LALA" everywhere. "LALA"? LALA! Huh, that's pretty fun to say! - Your majesty, I... - LALA! Try it, Clover. Rolls off the tongue. LALA. LALA. Come with me. I think this may be part of something larger... LALA! What was that? [crowd chanting] LALA! LALA! CLOVER: Stop right there! [yells] - Run away! - Hi, Clover! [yells] [all yelling] [grunts] [all panting] We ain't gonna lose her. Into those bushes! Quick! [yells] [moans] [stifled yell] [both yelling] Ow! Ow! Ow! LALA! LALA! LALA! LALA! MORT: LALA! [gasps] [laughs] That was fun. Let's do it again. [sniffs] Mmm... [grunts] Maurice? What're you doing here? It was the only place I could go without being laughed at. Oh, my, wow, it's the silly dancing man again. So this is where you've been hiding. [laughs] - [grunts] - [gasps] And I'm wrong. Look, I know I have a reputation as someone who's not always warm or easy to talk to. But if you ever need someone to open up to, release all those feelings bottled up inside, you can talk to me. Really? Thanks, Clover. Y'know, dealing with this situation has brought up some painful memories... Oh, man up, Maurice! - I think I've found a clue. - [groans] I don't know what these brown smudges are. [shudders] Or if I even want to know. But these seem to be... - Pok-pok! - Huh? There's a pok-pok tree a little deeper in the jungle not too far from here. On it! [laughs] - [growls] - [moans] You sure this will do the trick? If the trick is sting the king with the most poisonous scorpion in the jungle, then... yep. - [scorpion chitters] - [Abner shudders] Now we just need to figure out who's gonna deliver this to the tyrant. {\i1}♪ Everybody groove, now {\i0}E{\i1}verybody ♪{\i0} Hello! Oooh! Is that a present for me? Nope, for the king. I'll give it to him. You sure about this, Mort? Yeah, I'm really gonna give it to him. [laughs] 'Cause there ain't no turning back. [laughs] He'll never see it coming. It'll be a big surprise. [giggles] Masikura, What would you... [gasps] Apologize. You did not even let me finish my question. - Apologize! - Bup, bup, bup. Shut it up. Now, Masikura, what would you do if you were me to make things right with Maurice, other than... Apologize! Ah! Masikura! Ah! I... I... Ah! All over you! Why does such a simple concept escape you? It may come as a surprise to you, but I have not yet perfected this whole being king thing. I had not noticed. Sometimes I do not even know what I am doing. I try to ask myself. "What would Uncle King Julien do in this particular situation?" Or you know, W.W.U.K.J.D.I.T.P.S. for short. You think because your uncle did not ever tell anyone he was sorry, that must be the right thing to do? Uncle King Julien left me with big socks to fill, baby. Sometimes I think I'll never be as great as he was. Your uncle was not great. In fact, he was a very bad king. Possibly the worst ever. But no one ever complained about him. They were afraid to. He got rid of any lemur who dared cross him. Well, he was pretty good at the exiling. Oh, he had the funniest catchphrase, uh, "Go die alone in the jungle!" If I remember correctly. I will miss his wit most of all. Your Majesty, the measure of a king is that he does what he thinks is right. Do not try to be your uncle. Strive to be better than him. Ok, so you are saying if I choose my own path, I could be the greatest king ever! Oh, Masikura, you are a very wise tree frog. [Masikura grunts] I am a chameleon. Yes, yes, you can be anything you want to if you dream hard enough. No, I am definitely a... I will tell Maurice I am sorry. And that unselfish act will prove to him and everyone else that I am the best king of all times! [loud banging] Got you a little something. Surprise! A present? Even though it is not my birthday, my half-birthday or my bi-monthly birthday anniversary? Wait. My brain is making an idea. While I am proving I am the greatest, most humble king ever, I could give this gift to Maurice. Yes. A peace offering would be a nice touch. - [stammers] - [scorpion chitters] Whoa. Sounds like something really good. I'm jealous. BECCA: I think we have some really solid ideas for what to do after we've overthrown King Julien. Yep. Next order of business. Who's gonna be the new king? The whole thing of this revolution was that we don't need a king. Well, yeah, but that was before we figured one of us could be king. Then I vote for myself. Now hold on. At least give me a chance to win your vote. Hate to break it to you. You two are so busted. Busted for what now? I found pok-pok residue at a crime scene today. The residue was on a mural that looked exactly like that one. Add that to the fact that your clubhouse is under the biggest pok-pok tree on this side of the island. Not to mention your little calling card in the middle of the jungle. Boom. So busted. [stammers] What're you doing? Destroying the evidence. Uh, there's other evidence in here, you idiot. [grunts] You're gonna tell me everything. No, I ain't! [Yells] We're liberating all the lemurs in the kingdom from the tyranny of King Julien. Well, golly! Why don't you just give her your life story, Abner! It ain't right to hit a lady. [both growl] [battle cry] [grunts] Now, tell me everything. We sent King Julien a special package that will be the last special package he ever receives because our special package has a poisonous scorpion in it. It's real dang special. I can stop this. Then I think you've got a decision to make. Save the king or put an end to our revolution. Tick-tock. Then I choose save the king. I think. Yeah, yeah. I choose save the king. Although... No, no, no. Saving King Julien is definitely the right call. It would be pretty cool to stop a rebellion though. Though it's not really a rebellion, is it? Oh, yes it is. Well, no, not really. It is too. - Not. - [both] Is! - Not. - [both] Is! - Is! - [both] Not! Is not a rebellion, precisely. [both] Huh? That settles it then. I'm off to save King Julien. [both] Uh... Hyah! Oh. She's good. You wanna make fun of me some more? No, I want to tell you with my own mouth, that I am very, very... bad at apologizing. [grunts, groans] But you have been my best buddy for many years. And I know it must be difficult to live in the shadow of a truly great lemur like me. Difficult is a good word here. I should have listened to you and thought of your feelings. And for that, I am s... [stammers] I am s... [stammers] Uh, I am s... [stammers] Sorry! I'm sorry. And I will do whatever I can to make it better. Just hearing you say it was all I needed, your majesty. Thanks. And to help us bury the axe, I offer you this gift. Picked it out myself, very special, hope you like it. Hyah! [Grunting] Is this another prank? Stomping on my present? No. Maurice, I promise you. I would never do that even though it sounds pretty fun. [shouting] Clover! Stop mashing my peace offering! It's... empty. Huh. [scorpion chitters] Uh... false alarm. Crisis over. It's a good thing nothing was damaged. Maurice, I hope you like it. Remember, it's my thoughts that count. - Carry on. - Wait. Why would you give me a... - [shrieks] - [chitters] [yelling] Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Ah! Ah! [shrieks] My back! Your Majesty, you're safe now. [yelling] Hmm? Freaking out over nothing? Really? [all laughing] [laughing] Y'all see that? All that screaming over an itty-bitty nothing. [laughter] Yeah, that was my big surprise twist ending of my apology. Hey, everybody, remember that time I pretended I was so scared of that stupid little nothing bug? Ah! [screaming] [laughter] MAURICE: Y'all see that? JULIEN: So let me get this straight: There's a guy out there called The Man who is keeping everybody down? MORT: Mm-hmm! JULIEN: We should find this The Man and overthrow him. Your Majesty, are we sure that you're not The Man? Uh, I think I would know if I was The Man. [laughs] Okay, no. You need to go. Nobody is laughing at my friend any more. Uh, King Julien, I think he was laughing at you. Me? Don't be ridiculous. The tone of that laugh was clearly directed at you. Yeah... I don't know. Of course you do. Scene over. Hit me with that dope beat, Mort! [dance music plays] {\i1}♪ Everybody ♪{\i0} {\i1}♪ Everybody{\i0} {\i1}Everybody groove now ♪{\i0}
