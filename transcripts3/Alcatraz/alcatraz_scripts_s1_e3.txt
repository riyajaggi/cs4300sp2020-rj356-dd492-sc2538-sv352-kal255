 Alcatraz (2012): Season 1, Episode 3 - Kit Nelson - full transcript 
 The third monster returning from Alcatraz is the most despised yet: threefold convicted child murderer Kit Nelson kidnapped young Dylan Callahan from his bed, terrifying kid brother Liam to silence. Diego 'Doc' Soto realizes his MO is to spend the weekend with him and return the corpse home and breaks emotionally when Emerson Hauser heartlessly sets up a trap there, but finds them himself, although that doesn't go well either. In 1960, Warden Edwin James heaped his cruelty on top of customary abuse by fellow inmates and prison doctor Milton Beauregard.

 Scream... and I'll kill your brother. Hey, child killer. - Teach him a lesson. - That's right. I'm talking to you. Nowhere to run now, son. Time to skin this skinner. - Gonna get worse. Hey, child killer. Where you going, skinner? Filthy lag. Hold up, you sicko. - How long has it been? - Not long. Third dance they took him on since the weather turned? Could be the fourth. Could be his last. We'd all be better off.

 Take that. INMATE 2: How you like it, freak? Just get him inside before they kill him. Robert-Yankee-David-281. Car 6 stand by. Dispatch to sector one patrol sergeant. You have the best life ever. Smoking hot partner. Secret task force. Comic book guru. And you don't have to go to school ever again. So what you're saying is I'm a 16-year-old's wet dream? Here's one for you: Chrysanthemum. I'm not even sure if I'm saying it right. Chrysanthemum? You planting a garden, Vic? Filling out a report. Eleven-year-old boy went missing last night. His mom says all she found in his bed this morning was a flower. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - You okay, Doc? Any change? Sinoatrial node. You ever heard of it? It's a group of cells in the walls of the right atrium. Supposed to generate electrical impulses. It's a... Well, there's... still every chance that she could come out of it, right? Hey. Um... Guys? I know it's Saturday and all, but there's a boy missing in Walnut Creek. And they found a flower on his bed. A chrysanthemum. Which might just sound creepy and not like a clue... except the same thing happened in 1958... three different times with an Alcatraz inmate. And since some of those guys are, you know, back... I think... I mean, I know it's him. Kit Nelson, AZ-2046, who stole the kid from his bed. - Where'd you hear about this? - I heard on my police scanner. - You have a police scanner? - Not the point. We need to go. I mean, I know what this guy does. - I know what happens next. - What exactly is that, Soto? He kills them. Steals them on a Friday. Brings their bodies back home Sunday night. If we don't find this kid in 48 hours, he's gonna be dead. On March 21st, 1963, Alcatraz officially closed... All the prisoners were transferred off the island. Only, that's not what happened. Not at all. So tell me about Kit Nelson. Does he have any family that might still be alive? No. His mother died while he was in Alcatraz. His dad, in the early '80s. He had a kid brother who died of scarlet fever when he was 11. Hm. Eleven? Same age as our victim. This is it. I found it on Dylan's bed this morning. I don't know where it came from. But Dylan wouldn't run away, he's a good kid. - Did Dylan's brother see anything? - No, Liam was asleep the whole time. You recognize this man? Yeah, that's Warren, from Keller's Hardware. He knocked on our door looking for work. I didn't think... Why do you have his picture? Does he have something to do with Dylan? - Did he take my son? - He's a suspect in another case. - A case? A kidnapping? - What about you, Liam? Do you remember this man working at your house? Did you talk to him? He gave me rock candy. Okay. When's the last time you saw him? Was he in your bedroom last night? I pretended to be asleep because I was scared. You know what, Liam? You helped us out a lot. I really appreciate it, thank you. - The address for the hardware store? - Yes. Remember the rules. One hour or two? Give me two hours. And a pail of worms. This ought to do you. I'd set your nose, but given your popularity around here... I don't think it'll hold. You got anything stronger? - How about a cigarette? - No, not my brand. Suit yourself. I got an 8 and 10-year-old... so if you're looking for something stronger... you're crap outta luck. Hey, what's so damn funny? You don't wanna mess with Dr. Beauregard... or you'll end up on this side of the screen... giving enough blood to put the Red Cross out of business. You know, your situation might improve... if you made pals with some of your fellow lags. But you don't like grown-ups, do you? No friends your own age, as far as I can tell. Shut the hell up and get off my back, will you? What does make a grown man pick on kids? You really hate them that much? That's it for today, Madsen. Wow, they really did a number on you, didn't they? Damn prison pecking order. Is it rapists, robbers, thieves? Or thieves, rapists, robbers? Robbers, murderers, rapists. And child killers. Didn't beat you because of what you did, they beat you because of what you are. Never seen him before in my life. Said his name was Warren and that he worked here. Hey, Warren. - That's Warren. - Where's his uniform? We had a break-in last week, they took it. Take anything else? A couple of kids' fishing poles. It stood to reason it was kids did the stealing so I didn't report it. Where do people fish around here? Well, there's really only one place. Lafayette Recreation Area. Okay. I need you to get into the water now. What do you mean? Into the water. Now. Okay. Now I want you to hold me under for as long as you can. - I can't. You're bigger than me. - Just do it. And don't let me up. Do it. Do it! Ah! Your turn. So he took the kid fishing. Rental guy said they were wet when they left. I guess they went swimming too. So he wants a buddy now? Someone to play with? You know, a teenager in '58 said he saw Nelson playing miniature golf... with one of his victims the day before he killed him. No one believed the kid. They thought it was too creepy to be true. Didn't make it into any of the crime reports. I dug it up doing research for my book. But if he did take that kid to miniature golf, and he took this kid fishing... Maybe he lets the kids pick things they like to do. Like some kind of sick last hurrah. Lures them in. Makes them have fun before he... you know. You okay? What? Yeah. No, totally fine. Okay. Let's go find out what else Dylan likes to do. Eat your popcorn. - I don't want it. - Eat it. All of it. Let's you and me take a ride. I'd rather stay in my bed if it's the same to you, warden. Get in the chair. I take no offense off your hostile tone... since it's me responsible... for the inmates who wrought on you this beating. But know this. Dusk till dawn, I've wracked my brains and still can't fathom... what in heck to do with the likes of you. So I've decided to separate you from the pack. Meals in your cell. Ten minutes private time in the yard. Once you're back on your feet, of course. That's not what brings me here to speak to you today. I received a letter from your father. He'd like to visit. - Well, he's not on my list. - He's your father. And served two tours in the war, as did I. Well, he's still not on my list. Well, that puts me in a bona fide conundrum. Lord only knows what kind of family business... he needs to speak to you about so urgently. But if he's willing to travel all this way... he's earned the right to see your ugly mug. You leave it to me to amend your list myself. Now get up. What? - Hey. How am I supposed to get back? - Walk. The amber alert for Dylan Callahan, you need to cancel it immediately. I already cancelled on a national level. Walnut Creek's all that's left. No, no, you're not listening to me. I don't have time to get down there. She's still in the hospital. That's why I'm calling. We need to know some of Dylan's hobbies. - Are there places he likes to go? - Anything he likes to do? Um, he goes to the comic-book store every Wednesday. And he likes to watch cartoons. The Simpsons, South Park. King of the Hill sometimes. Okay. Does he like to do anything outside? Boating? Fishing? Swimming maybe? No, he's not athletic. He likes to be indoors. Wait. Wait, I got it wrong. - Doc, that's okay. - No, it's not okay. - We gotta figure it out. - Doc? The other case this man is wanted in. I want you to tell me this time. - Did they get their kid back? - Cherry pie. - Cherry pie? What? - Doc? Why don't you go wait out front for me? Yeah, good idea. I'll wait out front. - Thank you. All units responding to amber alert... Where you guys going? Amber alert's been cancelled. Wait. What? Probably has to do with the mom divorcing the kid's dad. The dad? Do you think the dad has any idea what a chrysanthemum even looks like? You're not going. The alert, it's uncanceled. I'll take care of this. You did this? You cancelled the amber alert? - Yup, I did. For the greater good. - What's more important than this kid? What's important is that the house doesn't look like a crime scene. How are we gonna find out where he's going? We know exactly where he's going. Right back here. So that's how you're gonna catch him? Great idea. The only problem, Dr. Strangelove, is the kid will already be dead. - Lower your voice, Soto. - You don't get it. We can save this kid. We need the alert to get Nelson's photo out there. That's exactly what we can't do. Put out photos of a '63. God forbid someone figures out your little secret. Did you just cancel the amber alert while the kid's still missing? - It's complicated. - No, it's not complicated. It's simple. I know this because I'm a human being. I'm not like you. Doc, calm down. Just let him walk it off. The kid. Lucy. He's emotional. What if the mother had heard? - These situations need to be handled. - You should have told us about the alert. He's just not cut out for this job. He's a comic-book writer. In the past three days, he's seen 10 dead bodies... and he watched Lucy get shot 5 feet away from him. - Look, we're a man down. We need him. - You need him. You know what? You're right. Just get rid of him. I'm out of here. You're free to go. But you can forget about finding your grandfather. My God, this isn't about my grandfather. There's 302 men, right? And they're all coming back. And they're all as evil as that sick freak that took Dylan. Yes, I need Doc, but I need you too. I know how upset you are about Lucy. Unless you have a better idea, you're gonna have to trust me. Us. If you don't, you're gonna end up alone in this. Hey, you got any cherry pie? Best in the county. This guy order any? Might've been with an 11-year-old kid. No. If he had tried my cherry pie, he wouldn't look so damn unhappy. You've reached Doc, Dr. Soto, Doc's Comics... your doc in shining armor. Take your pick. Come on, Doc. Where are you? I was thinking about what you said. The cherry pie thing. Okay. I don't know. If Nelson isn't doing what the boys like to do... is he doing what he likes to do? Is that what you meant by cherry pie? Is that something Nelson likes? Just call me, please. He's not picking up. You think he's out searching for cherry pie? He has a theory, which is more than anyone in this room can say. Look at Nelson's box. Nail clippers, cigarettes, soap. To you and me, it means nothing. To Doc, it's a life story. And that's why we need him. Get him back. - Another round? - Make it a double. Hey, miss, give us two slices of cherry pie, would you? A couple waters with that, thanks. Oh, hey, honey. How are you? Doc, what's going on? Are you okay? Yeah. I mean, no. I'm at the Hillcrest Diner on Pacific Drive. Just, you know, hanging out. Kit Nelson there with you? - Yes. - Is Dylan with him? Yes. Huh? Doc, stay put. I'm on my way. There you go. Thank you, ma'am. All right. Dig in. No. Hold your fork in your left hand. Do it. I'm glad to see they're treating you like you deserve. Say what you came for and leave. Your mama died. She left you something. A dried chrysanthemum. Your mama told me how she went to her daddy's funeral for the weekend... and left you boys alone. How when she came back... Elliott was dead... his body burning from scarlet fever. But that wasn't the truth, was it? You hated your brother because he was different than you. He loved life. Swimming in lakes, miniature golf, cherry pie. But not you. Your mama knew what you did. She wasn't prepared to lose two babies on one day. So she protected you. She told everyone a lie and buried the body before they could look. But your little plan backfired. You got rid of him and your mama ignored you even worse. She was scared of you. Of what's inside you. So tell me, son. Did you kill your brother? It was scarlet fever, just like mama said. You know... I thank God for Alcatraz. When I die, it'll be in peace... knowing you will be a rotting corpse before they let you out of here. Let's go. Come on. No, this way. Honey, let me get that for you. Excuse me. Do you have change for a dollar? No. Hey. What are you guys up to? Beat it, fatso. Kit Nelson. Let him go. Dylan, don't give up. Police. Let the boy go. No! REBECCA: Take it easy. Toss your gun on the ground. Over there. Now! Now your phone and your keys. Get over there. Now you're gonna handcuff yourselves to that dumpster. We just want Dylan. Do it! Okay. Get in the car. Now, if I see any headlights, anyone's, this kid dies. Ohh! I just got that kid killed, didn't I? Doc, wait up. Doc. Doc. - Comb. - Take it easy. Padlock. Nail clippers. Soap. A guy that evil uses soap. - Same as us. - It's not your fault. We're gonna catch this guy. Twelve hours. That's all we got. Ottoman's. Look, there's gotta be... - eight, ten packs in here. - Okay, didn't they all smoke? Yeah, prison-issued cigarettes, not name brands. These went for 5 bucks a pack. Only Al Capone or Machine Gun Kelly could afford these. So how'd a guy like Nelson get the money to buy them? Okay. I went through every check that came in while Nelson was there. And I found this. A check from C&C; Cement Company for $148.28. Ten days later... a deposit in the same amount made to Kit Nelson's commissary account. - So Nelson worked for C&C;? - It must've been back pay. - Only one check made out to cash. - No paper trail. C&C; went belly-up in the early '60s... but when they were in business, they built bomb shelters. A hundred and fifty in the western U.S. Including the towns where Nelson's three victims from 1958 lived. Bomb shelters. Yeah. That's the perfect place to hide in if he worked there. - He'd know where they were. - Including one in Walnut Creek. Fifty years ago there was a house there. Now it's just woods. No. No. No! That was the wrong move. I wanna go home. When can I go home? Soon. Where you taking me, huh? I didn't do nothing. Where you taking me? - Where are you taking me? - The best Alcatraz has to offer. Two impermeable layers of steel encasement... guaranteed not to bother you with light or sound. Get him inside. KIT: No! It's thin rations, you'd be wise to conserve your strength. No! No! This conversation's four matches long, son. Phillumeny. Word describes the collecting of match-related items... such as matchbox labels and matchboxes. This matchbox is a Swedish safety match... from the Jönköping match factory. Manufactured in 1858. Just in time for the American Civil War. I like it very much. I guess that makes me something of a phillumenist. That's number two. Now... tell me what you did to your brother. - My brother died of scarlet fever. - That's a lie, son. Your father would like to know the truth. It'll give me great pleasure to be able to tell it to him. I think you killed your brother. I think your daddy was off to war and your mama left you alone and... you killed him. Maybe you didn't mean to at first, but once you got a taste... indulged your dirty appetite three times further before they finally caught you. How's your math skills? I believe that's number three. You're doing this out of loyalty for another vet? No, son. I'm doing this... because I'm a father too. Is it your intention to remain in this dark casket... for the remainder of your time or are you gonna say what you did? Last match, son. Okay. It's like you said. Yes? I liked it. I liked it. We were in a bomb shelter out back... and I squeezed his neck as hard as I could. And I gotta tell you, it was not... difficult. He was kicking and screaming, he was trying to get my hands off him but... And then he just looked up at me. His eyes were red with little specks of blood in them... where the blood vessels broke. The pressure from all that screaming and nothing coming out. Not even air. And then his body just went soft and heavy. And that's when I knew. That he was dead? That I had to do it again. Bonus match. And the flower? - Oh, I put that on my mama's bed. - Consolation prize. Yeah. It was her favorite. Him too. Good boy. - I'm gonna do something for you now. - Mm-hm? I'm gonna let you keep your clothes. What? No. No. I told you the truth, just like you said. You're gonna leave me here? That's not fair. Fair. Interesting choice of words for someone who outweighs his victims... by a hundred pounds. Make them last. I'm hungry. Is there any food? You'll get food. It's cold down here. Could I at least get a blanket? Hey! Doc, there it is. Stop! DYLAN: Help! Please, help me! Please! Help! Help! Please, please! Don't move! You know, you didn't shoot before, you're not gonna shoot now. You don't have a weapon. Let the kid go. I think I'm gonna take my chances. Dylan. Even if we were allowed to tell people what we did... I doubt they'd believe us. You're probably right. I need a word. - With me? - Yeah. I'd like to stay. It's up to Soto. Arrested development. It's what happens when we're traumatized as children. We get stuck at the age we were when the trauma occurred. For our entire lives. And you were, what, 11? Do you know why I allow you to be here, Soto? Ten thousand hours. That's the time it takes for a person to become an expert on something. And I'm guessing you spent twice that studying Alcatraz. But I need the adult Soto. Not the 11-year-old. Yes, Mr. Hauser. Sir. Uh... That thing he was talking about... When I was 11, uh... It's okay, Doc. Whatever it is, I bet you've got a pretty good origin story yourself. Oh. The cherry pie thing? Read that in your book. Nice call. Wait for me. I'll only be a minute. Saw you're missing 12, 27 and 35. No way, this is awesome. So you okay? I'm fine. Well, let me know if you need any others. I'm still scared. When I was a kid... about your age... something happened... where someone took me. Just like that guy who took you, right? And it wasn't easy, but... I got away too. And once that happens... once you know that you can do that... it sort of gives you a superpower. Like theirs, but real. I didn't give up, like you said. I know you didn't. Dr. Beauregard, I got one for you. Roger that. I... may need your help with something. Depending on how things turn. It's for a friend of mine. Armed and ready, sir. Wine Well, I'm feeling kind of good now 'Cause I'm in my wine Sometimes I'm laughing And then again I'm crying I don't mean you no harm I'm just having fun I'm in my wine OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
