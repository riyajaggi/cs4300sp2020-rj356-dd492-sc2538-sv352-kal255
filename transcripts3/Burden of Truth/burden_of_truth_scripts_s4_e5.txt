 We need to cease all activity at the drill site immediately. You have 30 days. - Take the plea. - Luna. Take responsibility for what you did. My child could grow up without her mother. You mean the child you almost left behind? It is my decision to refer you to the bar association's disciplinary committee. They can decide if you deserve to continue to practice law. Okay, what am I looking at here? It's your truck following a client's car.

 Weed farm, Hank? But they've got cameras everywhere. So, if they passed us, we'll know. The sign-out sheet shows the driver was Farrell Jackson. Well, this will be enough to bring him in. Give me a name, and I'll go to bat for you. Crystal. Don't you get it? Crystal Chartrand. Missing person Millwood. Her name isn't Samantha Graham, it's Roy. Samantha Roy. I have to find her, Billy. I'm worried you might be suffering from some postpartum anxiety. I am not going down without a fight.

 And if you aren't willing to do what it takes, then stay out of my way. I think we're in trouble. Who starts? I can start if you'd like. But I would like to hear from you. It's all in the questionnaire. Yes. You've already put in a diagnosis. I'm a very good researcher. It's postpartum anxiety, if it's anything. Right? We don't have to draw the conclusion today. I would like to take care of this as soon as possible, if there are pills I can take or something? For what? To feel better. It doesn't quite work like that. We're in the middle of a case. It can wait for an hour. A lot of new mothers experience postpartum mood disorders. They are hormonal imbalances. It's a medical condition, not a weakness. Let's talk about your support systems. Are you close with your families? My father is um, he's deceased, and I don't see my mother much. But mostly just busy. And Billy? Oh, it's only my dad. He's fine. I'm just here for her. You're here together. Men have postpartum issues, too, and it's common for couples to both be suffering. What was your mom like? She was amazing. A rockstar. She passed away when I was 12. And how have you been feeling since Cassidy was born? Oh, we're not sure we're going to call her that. I just didn't know what to put on the form. Okay. We haven't settled on a name yet, it's not a thing. Okay. How about sleep? Yeah, there isn't much. She's not a very good sleeper. And we've both been working. Joanna went back to work right after she was born. As did you. But yeah, I'm just saying that you didn't take any time. I was asked to help out on a case, and I couldn't say no. Did you have a problem with it? No. Not at all. You do mention it a lot. Billy, any changes in routines or behavior? He's drinking more than usual. I'm drinking about the same. You switched from beer to whiskey. Do you find it's an issue, the drinking? No. No, not at all, and it hasn't changed. It might just seem like it has because you weren't... She wasn't drinking, obviously during the pregnancy, and then not really until you gave up breastfeeding. I couldn't breastfeed. I didn't give up. Okay. I didn't mean it like that. I... she's not herself, and I'm worried- don't tell me. You tell her. You're not yourself, and I worry about you. Now, is there a feeling between the two of you that you'd like to get back to? Yes. Okay. So, let's start there. Was that supposed to make me feel better? She said it herself, it takes time. We don't have time. The mine's closing in on Helen's farm, I'm facing disbarment. We can't afford to sit around and talk. We can't afford not to. For the record, I'm not drinking more than usual. Okay. Is that, "okay," like you agree or, "okay," like you don't feel like talking about it? - I'm not a bad mother, Billy. - I never said that. You didn't say I wasn't. Mining trucks. We have an injunction. Looks like not anymore. Kip, you can't be out here. It's the back yard. I don't care. No one can even see me. Relax. Just because Hatcher's in jail doesn't mean you're safe. Am I supposed to just sit inside all day? For now. They're going to figure out you took those pictures. I don't think I have to tell you what they do to snitches. Come on. I have to go to work. Stay inside. Don't open the door for anyone. You got it? This could be a really nice place. Coat of paint, maybe some more furniture. Yeah. Yeah. I am going to miss the luxuries of the Millwood motel, though. The paper-thin walls and stale coffee. Mmm. I'm working on a box marked Taylor's keepsakes. Is that cool? Yeah, yeah. That's just old yearbooks and cheerleading trophies. Have you talked to Joanna yet? It couldn't have been that bad. She's probably back on the mine case. The lady in the coma, the one where the mining trucks ran off the road? Helen Graham. Yeah. Yeah. Joanna has me looking into her missing daughter, a runaway. Hey, Tay. It's okay to be nervous. You should call her. Joanna knows where to find me. - Luna. - It's going to be fine. - Hey, you must be Taylor. - Yes, I am. First guest of my new place, and it's not even for me. Stevie. - You found it okay? - Yeah. - Sweet pad. - Thank you. It's all boxes, but I'm just moving in. Let me guess, your mover is more interested in her law books. Yeah. It's really nice to meet you, I just have to go. Meth house isn't going to raid itself. Bye. She's cool. Did she say meth house? Welcome to Millwood. I can't help you. We had 30 days on that injunction. The mine appealed. Another judge found the process was lawful and fair. The mine has savvy lawyers, too. Why weren't we told? I'm sure you'll receive notice soon. Courts aren't known for their efficiency. They don't have to wait for you to get notice before they start working. There's not much you could've done to stop it. Influential people in this town want this mine to happen. A mine employee ran my client off the road and put her in a coma. That's a substantial accusation. We have proof. Ms. Chang, gold star has a valid mining license. Oro north mine is going to open whether you want it to or not. Excuse me. It's not your fault. You were fighting federal charges on no sleep with a baby. I looked away. Why did you tell him we have proof? Because we do. We have persuasive evidence. We have video of a mining truck following Helen's car. On the road to the mine. I know they did it. You know they did it. That's not proof. We need to figure something out, fast. It's daycare. Told you she felt warm. We took a chance. You don't have to answer it. Hello? Yes, this is Billy. A fever, huh? Ugh, no, we'll be right there. Looks like we're going to have company today. The injunction was overturned. There's nothing you can do if their license is valid. So, how do we invalidate it? Thanks for the coffee. You got to be sharp when you're executing your arrest warrant. Yeah. Pretty sure I'm not going to fall asleep. You nervous? Nope. Good morning, mayor Freeman. Oh, good morning. Don't get up. Mayor Freeman. Chief. Am I interrupting anything? We're preparing to execute an arrest warrant. Huh. The judge sign off on this? Right at the bottom, wouldn't be an arrest warrant without it. Crystal Chartrand. Is she one of the Chartrands? Yeah. But she's operating independent now. Oh, any Chartrand behind bars is good for Millwood. Law and order was the centerpiece of my campaign, and I intend to deliver, no expenses spared. I want to help you make Millwood safe again. Was there anything I can help you with today? I saw that you arrested one of the Oro north men. We did. Farrell Jackson. I would've appreciated a heads-up. We make a lot of arrests. I was golfing with some of the executives yesterday. Look, we're all trying to make this work. Right? Hmm. He hit an innocent woman with his truck. Mm-hmm. - Helen... - Graham. Helen Graham, yes, I heard. I should reach out. She won't reach back. She's in a coma. Ah. That is terrible. Really. But this mine is going to revitalize the town, and we don't want to do anything to scare them away. People break the law and they get charged, no matter how deep their pockets. Make Millwood safe again. I would just prefer not to be blindsided again. I need to execute this warrant. And I need to leave you to it. Chief. Mining lease agreement, subsection 16, assignments and subletting. They're leasing a space to a truck company called nebulous transport. Could that be a breach of the motor vehicle insurance policy? It looks like nebulous is a subsidiary of gold star. That's maybe a fine, it's not enough to revoke a mining license. You want to switch? No, I'm good. If we're going to revoke an entire license, we're going to need something bigger. Here. Section 2.1, conflict of law. Maybe we could challenge the right of provinces to grant mining licenses period. That's black letter law. Separation of powers. It's in the charter. I'm willing to challenge the charter. Here, she's not even close to sleeping. Let me try. No. I've got it. I got it. The mine goes into production tomorrow. Do you really want to mount a supreme court challenge? Well, it might be enough to get us an injunction. We're not going to the supreme court. We can't even get our daughter to sleep. Everybody stay calm, eyes wide. Be smart. Move. This is chief Owen Beckbie of the Millwood pd. Open up. Crystal! Hit it. Freeze. Down to the ground. Clear. Clear. Hands where I can see them. Clear. Clear. Clear. Get up. You're under arrest. Do you understand? Clear the basement. Thorpe. We need a medic. Could you turn that down? That's as low as it goes before being on mute. Well, this contract is airtight which is impressive for government lawyers. I can't think. We can't keep rocking her to sleep. It gets the job done. We need to work. She has to learn to do things on her own, it's not just about results. You want to invalidate the mining license. So, choose the results you want and then work backwards. If the mine commits a felony like running a woman off the road, they can't just continue to operate business as usual. Like a morals clause in a celebrity contract. Yeah. Yeah, like that. Acting in good faith? No. - Best efforts. - No. Oh, here, they use this phrase a lot. Must adhere to good mining practices. It's capitalized, so it's a defined term. Good mining practices are defined as reasonable and appropriate in the industry and in conformity with the requirements of all applicable laws. The criminal code is an applicable law, and ramming an innocent woman with a truck doesn't conform. Therefore, they are not adhering to good mining practices. It could work. It's a foothold. It's something. But we have to prove that the mine ran her off the road. Then we can flip the driver. Farrell Jackson's jail cost hearing is today. She just quieted down. She falls asleep in the car. I'll stay with her, you go. No. I need you. We're a team. He should be in courtroom B. Farrell. I should've guessed. These are the two ambulance chasers that put the fix on Matheson steel. Are you his lawyer? No, union rep. Lawyer hasn't shown. Good. Then listen to me closely. You fled the scene of an accident, which is a criminal offense, and you left our client, Helen Graham, in a ditch. She may never wake up again. I got nothing to say to you. Gold star is forcing union members to do its dirty work, threatening to fire them if they refuse. Is that what happened to you, Farrell? You're in a lot of trouble unless this is the company's fault. If somebody told you to do this, we can make all of this go away for you. If the mine is making union members do things like that, I got to know. If they're threatening your livelihood, your ability to provide for your family, we will fight for you. No one was supposed to get hurt. Okay? And they didn't actually tell us to, they made it really clear that she was the reason why the mine wasn't open. So they told you to come after her. Yeah. Yeah. It was just stupid stuff at first. Okay? Blocking her driveway, harassing her. They wanted her out of the picture. Did someone use those words? Out of the picture? We all knew what they wanted. Who told you to do this? We want to help you. But we're going to need a name. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but he needs to confirm with his own lawyer. We'll figure out how to handle this best and get back to you. Now, you seriously sold Millwood short. This place is adorable. Adorable was never the word that came to mind. Don't be sucked in by the cliché small-town main street. There's the real Millwood. I'll be happy to get out of here and back to school. Well, moving sucks. You're a good friend. Next stop, Lucy's café. Basically my home office in high school, where I first met Joanna. It is so crazy your sister let you work cases in high school. When do I get to meet her? She's pretty busy. Yeah, but I'm sure she'd make time for you. Can we not, right now? - Okay. - Okay. Oh! - Miss Evans, it's just me. - Kip. What are you doing here? I'm crashing here with chief Beckbie. I thought he told you. Give me the bat. Hey. How come you have to fill these out? You said we weren't in trouble. You were found at a known gang hangout. We just need to make sure that everyone is who they say they are, just name, birthdate. It's not going on file. - Maylin. - Hey, do you remember me? Sure. Do you know where Dee is? I've just been trying to reach her by text. She's not in trouble, I just want to make sure that she's okay. I heard she ran away, or she tried. Anyway, she ain't here. How did you get these women? What was your recruiting process? Recruiting process. Any partners? I'm single at the moment, if you know anyone. What about Wesley? Name mean anything to you? Oh, honour amongst thieves. Call it what you want. In your house today, wasn't much honour in there. Oh, but your life's so honourable, right? Because this made-up country says you have the right to lock people up, shoot them and keep what they call law and order. I know what I did, and it's business. Maybe it's not the best business, maybe not the cleanest, but at least I'm honest with myself about who I work for and what I do. It's just business is the lamest lowlife excuse. What you do in this world is who you are. So, when you arrest innocent people or people who commit crimes because they're poor or trapped in the system, is that who you are in the world? I uphold the rule of law in a democratic country. Rule of law. Do you even hear yourself? The only laws I know are eat or be eaten, dominate or be dominated. Those are the lessons I learned in this democracy. You want to make yourself out to be a Nora Bernard, go ahead. But you're no freedom fighter. You're a drug dealer who trafficks women, our women, for money. Better than being a victim. You know study group's falling apart without you. The other day, we spent two hours explaining vested remainder to Jenya. I'd say we should kick her out, but she bakes good cookies. I'm sorry about before. - It's okay. - No, it's not. It's just Joanna and I. We're not really talking. Why didn't you tell me that? Is it cool if we don't really talk about that right now? Yeah. Of course. Seriously, I'm so glad you're here. Tay, you home already? Who the hell are you? Where's Taylor? We get Farrell to sign an affidavit and we go straight back to judge Williams. The show cause hearing should be done by now. These things always run late. And he hasn't agreed to anything. You heard him. We were right. If he takes the blame without implicating the mine, we've got nothing. Where's Farrell? He's meeting with the lawyer. As union rep, shouldn't you be there? Spoke to the lawyer. She says it's a mine problem, not a union issue. Oh no. Farrell. Farrell, don't do this. This way. From now on, if you want to talk to my client, please do it through me. He was this close to spilling. I'm sorry. Well, we must've been onto something if they brought Elise in that fast. They're scared, Billy. I don't know about scared, but you definitely got their attention. I won't then. It is fine, just do what you want. You have to go right back at them. They won't be expecting it. Maybe someone else heard the order. Just have the drink, Billy. I'm not judging you. Someone gave that order. We need to go higher. We need Farrell's boss. - We find him, we flip him. - We have no idea who that is. The whole place is a mystery. Which is by design, to maintain control. Okay, you're... You're being ridiculous. Just have the drink. I don't want it now. Somewhere, there's a list of mine employees, payroll, health insurance. We have to get our hands on that. Tax credits. Millwood gives municipal tax credits for employees. Tax credits are public record. And they're filed at city hall. Do you want some? Is Owen even feeding you? We order in. Burgers, pizza. You tasted his cooking? Umm... Yes, once. And I will never eat chicken a la king again. Your auntie get better? He told me she was sick in Guyana. Yes. A lot better. Thanks. How's school? Are you still at east Millwood? Dropped out last year after Kokum died. Oh, kip. I'm so sorry to hear about your Kokum. As a principal, I do have to encourage you to go back to school. You need an education. What kind of trouble you in? Kip, you're in my house. I need to know. Some people are kind of mad at me. Dangerous people? I can find somewhere else to stay. No. No, you won't be safe anywhere else. Dee. Hey. I really hope it's okay that I came. I scared the crap out of your friends. They're still outside. - Your neck, what happened? - It's nothing. Was it Wesley? Said something I shouldn't have. But when we stopped for gas, I ran. Good for you. I'm so sorry I left the way I did. No, you don't need to apologize to me, Dee. No one's talked to me like I'm a person in a while, so I guess it just kind of freaked me out. I know. I get it. I'm just so glad that you're here. We raided the Chartrand house today, rescued some more girls, and they're safe. We arrested a bunch of people. Wesley? No. I'm sorry. We will, though. I promise you. You can stay here if you want. I'd like that. I think we're going to order some food. You can come out if you're hungry. - Diane. - Owen. You're a day early. Came to surprise you, but you beat me to it. Anything big happen while I was away? Uh... Dee, are you... Are you coming? The fire's still warm, but the pizza is definitely getting cold. Dee? I got to get out of here. Dee, please don't go. This was a mistake. You're safe here with us. Wesley's going to be pissed when he finds out about the raid. He'll find me. No. No, he won't. You've been so good to me. I'm not putting you and your friends in danger. Dee, I am a cop. I can handle him. I'm not taking that risk. Dee, wait. Please. I can't let you go. I won't. I'll be okay. No, Dee. You won't. He could kill you. He gets crazy sometimes, sure. But he also bought me this. And he bought me these, too. And sometimes he takes me for nice dinners, but money doesn't grow on trees, Taylor. Is that what he tells you? He's got some financial issues. He needs me to help him out. No, Dee, it is not helping him out if you don't have a choice. It's trafficking, it's exploitation by coercion or force. You know nothing about me or my life. - Please. - She might not. But I do. - Really? - Yeah. All the nice presents, fancy restaurants. Dee, I know you've heard it before, but it's called grooming. Not everyone gets the fairytale romance. Yeah, tell me about it. My mom worked at a fancy country club when she was a teenager. An older guy bought her presents, too. Made her feel special, made her feel loved. When she got pregnant with me, he couldn't drop her fast enough. When you're gaslit, groomed, and lied to, you're not really choosing. Dee... My last hit was yesterday, okay? You really want to watch withdrawal kill me? You need methadone for a few weeks. What? My girlfriend's parents are both doctors. They could call in a prescription to a local pharmacy, if you want. Hey. There you are. How's the medication going? It's good. Taylor's administering it now. Is there anything that girl can't do? Unpack. Look Stevie, if you want to go back to Winnipeg, I get it. This is more than you bargained for. No. Wait. I'm good. It's never a dull moment in Millwood. How come you never told me that stuff about your mom? You heard. The sound travels in this place. I just wish you had told me. I'm just sick of people believing all my history, you know? Yeah, but I’m not people, Luna. I'm your girlfriend. I know. But that's not what I meant. You just... You got to tell me things. Especially the hard stuff. Okay. These tax records should give us the lead we've been waiting for. We find his boss, we find our guy. Well, how are we supposed to do that? These forms have names but no job titles. This box. There's a letter and a number. Yeah. C08, D04. They all have them, so it must mean something. Could it be a job code? Farrell Jackson is D12. There are four letters, a through D. Maybe they're departments. Farrell's a truck driver so D could be the transport department. Okay, pull all the Ds. The numbers go up in increments, four, eight, 12. That's the corporate structure. So, D08 would be Farrell's boss. Okay. D... D08. D08. Scott Ballinchuck. That's our guy. Hey. Hey. Where'd you get that coffee? I found some instant in the cupboard. Oh, I don't think Taylor's gone shopping yet. Must've belonged to the old tenants. It tastes that way. But caffeine's the only drug I got left. How'd you sleep? I didn't. But at least I wasn't sick. So, thanks. So you don't think I'm a total airhead, I know what I am. Okay? And I know what Wes is. I just wasn't sure about you guys. Your dad sounds awful. He was. He's gone. Sorry. Don't be. When I was a kid, my family used to leave me at a drug dealer's house for collateral. I was the perfect prey. Guys look for that stuff. And by the time Wes came around, no one even noticed I was gone. If it hadn't been him, it would've been someone else. At least at the start, Wes was a Romeo. Types of pimps. Okay. There are romeos, and gorillas. Now that I'm out of pocket, Wes has turned into a gorilla. You thought about running before? I don't think about running. Well, most of us have nowhere to go and no money to get there. I know he'll find me one day. Stevie and I are law students. We'll get you a restraining order. Pimps don't care about court orders. My friend, Annie, she got a restraining order against her man and now she's got a cut throat. What I really need is cash, at least enough of it to get proper treatment, get clean, the hell away from here, fresh start. Okay. Then let's get you a fresh start. It's a genuine offer, Dee. Let me help you. Okay. And with Beckbie as police chief, Mr. Tillman, in this town and your mine has never been safer. Well, I don't know about that. Oh, come on. He's just being modest. Just yesterday he headed a major operation bringing down a notorious crime lord. - Oh. - Yeah. Congratulations. And if any protestors try and show up, your people will nip it in the bud. Absolutely. I'm pretty sure they're entitled to exercise their freedom of speech. Of course they are. Just not here. That's good. Hi. Ah. Good afternoon, Millwood. Now, the rebirth of a town is made up of many ingredients. A healthy economy... Do you see him? Not yet. So, we find Balinchek, tell him we got a witness who says he ordered him to target Helen. Yeah, we just need him to give us a name. Then if we prove conspiracy, we implicate the corporation. Do you think he'll talk? It's a criminal charge. His only way out of this is to expose the mine's management and then get legal protection as a whistleblower. ...and with a substantial financial contribution, Millwood is now a partner in future prosperity. Huh? Is that him? Third from the left. Could be, yeah. So happy to see you both here. Change your tune about the mine? Heard you went searching for the tax records. But your friend Farrell Jackson, he just confessed to everything. He ran your client off the road, completely on his own. The mine had nothing to do with it. Why don't you leave these poor people alone and let them do their jobs? Hi. You too, chief. All right. Team Millwood. To the future. She's finally down. Determined little thing, just like her mother. You did everything you could. And it didn't matter. I lost. I let Helen down. And law was the thing I was supposed to be good at. Joanna... I can't compete with your mother, Billy. I know that she was a rockstar mom, but she didn't have to fight a mine and try and save Millwood. It's unfair. I never said you had to be her. I feel your disappointment. You... You have no idea what it's like to not be able to feed your own baby. I feel like enough of a failure on my own. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way. I know. But you did. When we're working together, I always feel like you have my back. I feel supported. We're a great... We're great legal partners. But as parents, I just never felt that from you. I'll do better. It's Taylor. Any sign of Wesley? No. They're still looking. Maybe he left town. Maybe. My guess is he won't leave until he ties up loose ends. - Dee. - Yeah. So, we need to figure out a way to help her. What can we do? Just like at the legal clinic, we take her case. We can't take on a client. We have exams at the end of this term, and we're not lawyers. Stevie, if she gets sucked back in, I don't know if she'll survive. It's just a couple days, and then we're back in class. Luna, that's crazy. She needs us. This is more important than school. A couple days. I promise. Apology pizza. I had pizza yesterday. It's Joanna. Is that your girlfriend? Yeah. Okay, well, I'll just leave this with you. It's good for breakfast, too. Hot or cold. Joanna, wait! How is she? Your client. There's no change. She's still in a coma. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, and I just lost the fight to save her farm. I let her down. Millwood too. Come on, you did your best. And you played by the rules. And lost. There's this woman I'm trying to help. She's been trafficked. She was forced into the sex trade, and I'm searching for a way that the law can protect her, something better than just a restraining order. I'm on a bit of a losing streak right now, I'm not sure I'd be of any help. I don't believe that. Our father always said that the law isn't very good at protecting people. It's better at compensating them once the damage has been done, reallocating assets from one party to another. I'm not sure that helps. It does. Thanks. Yeah. I've missed you. Hey. I was going to come see you. - Me? - Yeah. We raided a house yesterday and found someone you were looking for. Here's her file. It's your client's daughter. Samantha Roy.
