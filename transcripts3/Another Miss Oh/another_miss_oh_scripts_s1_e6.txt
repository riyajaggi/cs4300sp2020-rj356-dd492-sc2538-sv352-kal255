 What was that? Can't you come home early for me? I don't expect you to love me back. I'm so bored. That's all! My goodness. Hey, what's wrong? Hello? What happened before the hyperventilation occurred? The sound of it is very elegant. Isn't it? This sound resembles you.

 Whenever I think of him, all the oppressed feelings that I've been bottling up burst out. All the grief that I could never DO-KYEONG talk about. Now, I want to tell him why I had to do that. But he doesn't want to listen to me. EPISODE 6 Why would Hae-young go on a blind date with such a loser? Is she so old and worthless that she has to meet a loser like that? It's not like I need someone to take care of her because we're dying. Instead of punching the jerk in the mouth, you said you'll ask her about it?

 That son of a bitch. Tell him not to worry. Hae-young doesn't have to get married. She can live alone! -She should get married, though. -No, she doesn't have to. -She should. -I said, she doesn't have to. Yes, she does. Why? For what? She should get married. Look at me. If I didn't have you in my life... I would be nothing. You wench, I would have killed you if you were home today. Your room is a pigsty. I'll set the place on fire if I see it like this again. Both my husband and daughter, they're such pitiful souls. It's far too early for this. Are you not going to go to work? I need some rest. Keep it down. Don't come in when I'm not home. What has she been doing? Don't even mention it. They were shouting at each other to leave. It was a mess. It was originally one big house. The landlord rented out each floor separately, then he rented out the storage room on the second floor. He just blocked the doorway with furniture. The doorway should be blocked by now. I heard that they were sealing it off. Why? Does your daughter want to leave? No, not at all. I was just curious about her neighbors. You need nice neighbors. You couldn't find better neighbors. The woman is a director in a large company, and her brother on the second floor owns his own business. They've been living there since they were children. Everyone in this neighborhood knows that they are good people. Their mother is a different story, but the kids turned out well. Their mother lost the house because of bad business dealings, but they rented it and want to buy it back. They're good kids. Honey, kicking Hae-young out of the house was the best choice ever. You met both Oh Hae-youngs at the same place? I got the chills again. Gosh, I need to pee. Oh, gosh. Move overseas. Moving to a different house won't be enough. There's no other choice. What did Hae-young say? Why did she disappear? Why? I don't know. I didn't ask. Isn't that what she wanted to talk about when she asked to meet? We didn't get a chance to talk. I just left. You should've asked her, dumbass. Why would I? Because I'm curious. I know you are too. She was fine the night before, then disappeared without a word. There's no plausible reason why she would do that. Also, what's the matter with the Hae-young upstairs? She's thoughtless. Why does she suddenly want to pretend that you're dating? They're both crazy. Are all Oh Hae-youngs that crazy? Does the name have bad karma? They work together, so they must talk about stuff. If the one upstairs finds out that her marriage was ruined by mistake because of the other Oh Hae-young... Gosh. Soo-kyeong must be insane. -Why did she bring Oh Hae-young in? -Do you think she wanted to? -It was probably a directorate decision. -She should have prevented it! There she is. Perfect timing. Keep your mouth shut. It's so amazing that she always finds her way home while she's drunk. Did you get her microchipped? She'd be perfect in a circus. Let me ask you one thing. Go to your room and sleep. Will the aliens come or not? I asked you a question. Will the aliens come or not? They'll be here. They will come to get you. When are they coming? I'm sorry, Soo-kyeong. I don't have any alien friends yet. I'll ask them for you if I ever meet them. When you meet them, make sure you ask them to crush this planet. -I want to die heroically at war. -Okay. Can you die alone? I still have a lot of women I want to be with. I don't want to go alone! We'll all die together heroically. Every single one of us! Jin-sang, can I have just one more shot with an alien? Unbelievable. Ever since you left, I drink every night. I sit alone at the bar we used to drink together at, and wait for you. Cheers. I love you passionately. Even though I miss you like crazy... Welcome. ...I'm scared you might see what a mess I am. So I untie my hair and cover my face again. I miss you, but I don't want to see you at the same time. I'm sitting here every night, with this crazy thought in my head. My darling, where are you and what are you doing? Do you ever think about me? Run! The aliens are finally here. It's over for Earth. I don't ever have to suffer because of you. We'll just simply die. I'll die and you'll die. -Excuse me. -Soo-kyeong? Knock, knock. Before we die, let's have one more go. -Soo-kyeong. -Just once more. Please, no. Aliens must come. Earth needs to be shattered into pieces. Hello. I think we met before. The window guard... -Oh, yes. -We are very grateful. -Sure. -It's my daughter's birthday today. She's 32, but she doesn't have a man to celebrate her birthday with, so I should congratulate her, at least. Bye for now. Hold on. Gosh. Isn't this too much for breakfast? It's your birthday, this isn't too much. Come and sit down. -Hey, over here. -Hey. I'm sorry, but I'm going out of town later. We're hunting for filming locations. Those jerks told me at the last minute. Don't worry about me, it's okay. Hey, we're too old to get excited over birthdays. Forget it. Does Do-kyeong know that it's your birthday? How would he know that? Do you want me to slip it to him? Don't do that. Seriously, don't! I should have never told you about him. Don't bother. I'm going to get over him. -You're lying. -I'm not. Why would you do that? He used to date Oh Hae-young. So what? Everyone has a past love or two. I don't want one that used to date Oh Hae-young. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR THE GIRL NEXT DOOR Who is it? I heard it was your birthday. We should celebrate with drinks. Set the table. I'll be over soon. How did you know it was my birthday? -Did Hee-ran tell you? -I saw your mom this morning. My goodness. Why would she go around telling people about my birthday? You thought buying a cake was too much, but you felt bad for not having one, didn't you? I can tell you've put a lot of thought into this. -What is this? -I found it at home. You should stop listening to that weird laughing toy. It's to pay you back for that soup you made me. Are you scared that I might take this the wrong way? I know what this is. It was just sitting at home, right? It's pretty, the sound. Yes. What? I already ate. Home. Where else would I be? Yes, I'm alone. PARK HUN What? Why do you need my car? Wait outside. I'll throw the key. Throw it. Thank you. I appreciate it. We're going on a drive. We won't do anything else. Let's go! Wow. This is so exciting! Go! How long are you going to block the way here? Are you scared I might throw myself at you? There's one good thing about having feelings for the guy next door. He makes me want to come home early. I'd never wanted to come home until I got wasted. Can't you come home early for me? I don't expect you to love me back. I'm so bored. That's all! My goodness. It's not even dusk. What am I going to do? Seriously... Have you been recording everything? It's a habit. Sound designers record anything. We want to know what sounds come out while we're away. Many of us turn the recorders on in the morning. -That's all. -You should have stopped after I moved in! I rarely listen to it after I come back home. How can I listen to a 12-hour audio file? I haven't listened to it once since you moved in. I was drunk that day. I tend to come on to people when I get drunk. That's what it was. Quit drinking. And don't come on to anybody. Don't come on to guys like me. Get a hold of yourself. Stop blaming yourself like a foolish woman, too. Why are you overreacting like that? You're not the only one I come on to. In my imagination, I come on to about four to five of my male colleagues. So don't get afraid and stop overreacting. It's offensive. I really enjoyed listening to sounds from your room while you were away. Grocers shouting and people fighting outside... They weren't anything significant, but I really liked them. It felt like I was rewinding time. -So I did it at home as well-- -Just make your point and leave. Then we'll be up all night. ONE YEAR AGO You look tired. Yes, a little. There's a lot I have to take care of. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning. It's okay. I can get there by myself. Let's just meet at the beauty salon. -Goodnight. -You too. That was the last time I saw you. So I kept thinking about the reason why you had disappeared. "Why did she leave?" I couldn't figure it out. But there was only one reason that I could forgive you for. That's if you had no choice but to hide from me because of a fatal illness. I could forgive you if that was the reason. Then I could talk about you to those around me. "She died. She disappeared because she was dying." I might have been able to save my face and remember you. Tell me. Was it a fatal illness? Did you miraculously get better and come back? No. You should have died. You showed up pretending as if nothing had happened. That drives me insane. Don't smile. I said, stop smiling like that. You know it's my habit. I smile while crying. You said you hate seeing women crying. Didn't you know that I smiled even when I wanted to cry so that you won't hate me? You always blame others. Don't ever come here again. It'll make me hate you even more. Why does it have to be her? Why Hae-young? Are you attracted to her because -we have the same name? -Don't you dare say that. We have the same name and went to the same school. Is it still a coincidence? Do you think I'm seeing someone similar to you because I didn't get over you? That happened a lot when I was in school. Many boys tried to get to me through her. -Hey! -You can't do this to Hae-young. Why are you here this late at night? I'm sorry. I should have called you first. -I'll leave. -No, it's okay. Wait here. Goodbye. Are you a kid? Why would you break the window? And why did you come out and leave them alone? If I were you, I would've opened the door and said, "Hi, we live together. What brings you here?" I would've stunned her. Seriously, you don't know how to win! You know I've always been intimidated by her. So stop being intimidated! I understand that you were young back then. But you're 32 years old. Why are you still like that? Does she bite you or something? And frankly speaking, you're in a more favorable position than she is. Do you think she can beat someone who lives literally next door to him? -I'm going to move out. -Gosh, you're so frustrating! Just go get him. It's as easy as that. He knows that I like him! He had been recording. He said he has a habit of turning on his recorder in the morning to hear what sounds it records. Without knowing that, I said, "Why aren't you home yet? When will you come home? I'm so bored. I like you." I rattled on like an idiot. I knew your talking to yourself would get you into trouble one day. I'm so embarrassed. I feel so ashamed and angry for liking him. I know you well enough, and you don't usually lose your head over someone like this. I sensed something from the moment you called off your wedding. I thought, "What's gotten into her? Is she out of her mind?" You were all over the place. It wasn't the Hae-young I once knew. I still feel like that, seeing you obsess over Do-kyeong. I really wonder what it is about him that you're so head over heels for. As soon as I met him for the first time, I poured out my heart to him. What did you tell him? Things I couldn't tell anyone. I... was dumped the day before my wedding. He told me he wasn't sure if he could love me for the rest of his life and... he said he couldn't stand seeing me eat. It's weird, but I could tell him everything. We had an election for class president. I eventually got a single vote. I voted for myself because I was worried that I wouldn't get a single vote. Did I keep telling him stuff because it got easier once I started talking to him? I guess you realized right away that he's the person you could lean on. That's what a relationship between a man and a woman is like. Although you can't tell your secrets to your ten-year-long friend, when you realize that he's the one to lean on, you can tell everything even when you've just met him. -Why is that so? -It's because he's a man. Anything can happen between a man and a woman. Although you're a good friend of mine, I also keep things from you. But I tell those things to men. I feel more comfortable with a guy I've known for less than a month than my ten-year-long friend at times. That's the way it is. Sleep at home. THE GUY NEXT DOOR I won't yell at you. Hey, just sleep here! It's so late! She really must have gone crazy. Gosh, I looked too excited. Just go to bed. What did Hae-young want? Will she come here again? No, she won't. There's no reason to. I'm telling you again. Don't mind what you heard from the recorder. I just fall for everyone. And one can say whatever one wants when alone. Don't take it seriously and feel uncomfortable. Then you'll make a fool of me. I got it. Just go to bed. And... don't ever turn the recorder on again. -I said, don't. -I won't. Gosh. I'll pay for a new window. -Forget it. -I will pay for it. It's warm. Your hand. Until we confess our love or mention marriage, don't we all put it that way? Until marriage is promised, I just consider them flings. Why does it have to be her? Why Hae-young? Are you attracted to her because we have the same name? Do you think I'm seeing someone similar to you because I didn't get over you? But there was only one reason that I could forgive you for. That's if you had no choice but to hide from me because of a fatal illness. You should have died. You showed up pretending as if nothing had happened. That drives me insane. My gosh, how can you get more beautiful every time? You have an actress's aura. Can we do this more often? It's so nice, the three of us, together like this. I thought it would be uncomfortable for you. No way. You should be. If my dad dies, all of his money comes to me. You're trying to suck up so that you can steal my money. If you're comfortable, that makes me mad. I'm not dead yet! Out of all the women he's married, you're the oldest and the most uncultured. Even your background is the lousiest. I'm curious as to how you seduced him. -You-- -Hold it in. It's not that easy to earn money. Why do you have to be like that every time? Ignore her. Why are you leaving already? I have a surgery. Don't get upset. She's harsh with words, but she's a nice girl inside. I can't live under the same roof as her. Oh, Yeong-ju. Long time, no see. It's nice to see you. I missed you. I was thinking of calling you. -Are you well? -Yes. And your dad? He's right there. I think he's getting married again. I didn't think my mom would be his last. Out of all the women he married, I think your mom was the most innocent. She didn't care for money. Is your mom doing okay? Yes, I assume so. -Relax. -Whatever. My goodness. Oh, dear. Yes? What? Look who it is. Hello. How have you been? I thought your mom was walking in. You're turning into your mother. What brings you here? I came to meet someone here, -and ran into Yeong-ju in the lobby. -I see. Hello. Right, say hello. This is my... How should I introduce you? Daughter. I was your daughter. She's my ex-wife's daughter. And this is... How should I introduce her? I heard from Yeong-ju that you'll be marrying her. We don't even have a date yet. Let's play golf with Yeong-ju some time. I guess he doesn't even drive you home. You told me that a daughter's fortune is determined by the mom and that I would switch men by the month. It's funny to see you being desperate for a man that my mom threw away. My mom was his fourth wife. If you marry him, you'll be his fifth. As a woman, isn't it humiliating to be the fifth? What's your point? Do you think you have the higher hand here? What is it? Do you want to break off my wedding? I want to. Just like you did to me. I want to break it off for you. You broke off your own wedding, not me! How dare you hang up on me? Is that what your parents taught you? Right. I forgot that they were never around. When I heard that both of your parents were professors, I thought, fine. But your father had an affair with a student, and your mother, with a fellow professor, all in the same college. And they were both fired because the scandal spread throughout. Do-kyeong knows everything. I don't hide anything from him. They're still professors at different colleges. Hey, there's more to it! Are they trying to compete and see who gets married more? How can they get married and divorced over and over again? Thanks to them, you have so many half-siblings! When was the last time you saw your parents? Do they even know you exist? Open the door! I know you're in there. Open up! Open up at once! I won't be at your wedding tomorrow. You don't have to come. You obnoxious wench. Hey, blood is thicker than water. I sent you a file. -Did you listen to it? -I don't plan to. You should. You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't. Do you think it's love? Do-kyeong doesn't love you. Hey, what's wrong? Don't make me feel so bad. Don't be like that. I have to go. Hae-young. Do you want to get a drink with me? I want to drink tonight. Actually, I want to drink a lot. I have plans. Really? Then I'll just drink alone. You should. You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't. VOICE MEMOS VOICE FILES VOICE RECORDING 1 Please pick it up. What a jerk. Darn it. That ingrate jerk. Hey. Ms. Heo. Come here. I said, come here! I told you never to show up in this neighborhood. What did I say will happen if you did? What is it? Are you to demand money from Do-kyeong again? Oh Hae-young showed up. So what? She is the daughter of Chairman Jang's ex-wife. Her mom was one of the women Chairman Jang was married to. Gosh. That stupid old man. Why did he get married so many times? He messed everything up. I had a feeling she would do something. If she opens her mouth, Chairman Jang won't marry me. Do-kyeong will turn his back on me too. Then, I'll be penniless for sure. Are you admitting that you're the one who made Hae-young leave Do-kyeong? I thought so. Hey. Go ask anyone passing by. What kind of a mother would let her son marry a girl like that? Her parents get married and divorced like it's their hobby. What would she have learned from them? What about you? If you marry Chairman Jang, it's your third time too. Three times is nothing compared to her mom. She wasn't picky at all. She married all sorts of guys. She didn't care about her kids. She acted like she didn't have any kids while she obsessed over man after man. She's insane. Don't blame it on her mom! You didn't break off Do-kyeong's wedding because of that. You know it, I know it, and so does the rest of the world! You were scared he wouldn't give you any more money. You needed him to marry a girl that would have no clue if you drained her husband's accounts. Oh Hae-young was too smart for you, right? You were scared she'd steal your piggy bank. You would turn your son into a lonely old bachelor if you had to, as long as he filled your pockets! You! Listen. Even dogs care for their offspring more than you do. Although she was terribly harassed by you, she didn't say a word to Do-kyeong. She didn't want to stir things up between you and Do-kyeong, so she didn't say a word. That's how much she loved him. What did you do to her to make her run away on her wedding day? What did you do? What did you do? Don't you dare show your face around here again! It's too fine. Sift some gravel and mix it in. I thought you wanted to do this the easy way. Making sounds for an adult film in the studio is easy. Do you call this easy? Hurry up before the sun sets. Oh, gosh! Do-kyeong, he's going to die. Let's take a break. Hoon. Hoon. -Are we done? -Here. Are we eating? Did you come here to sleep? Yes, good. That's good. Ready, set, go! -I won. -Good job. -Hurry up and get up. -My back hurts. -Don't lie. -It was a lie. I'm telling you again. Don't mind what you heard from the recorder. And don't ever turn the recorder on again. I said, don't. DELETE How is that possible? Gosh. Shit. Gosh, I didn't know this was so hard. I really have to go. Oh, no. -Who is it? -You have a package. Honey, we have a package. -Are you Oh Hae-young? -Yes. Thank you. Bye. Honey? Honey. It's finally here. It's just a door, but I feel so much safer. But the problem is, I can't go over should there be an emergency. He and I must have switched genders. Shouldn't I be the one to block the door? Why is he the one to do so? Gosh. What a day it was. My whole body aches. Dear all the deities above who are busy caring for every soul in this world... You must be busy looking after those in need... You must be busy visiting and comforting all of them, but if you have some time to spare, please visit me, Oh Hae-young... Be sure not to get confused with the pretty Oh Hae-young. Please come by the ordinary Hae-young who lives alone in Pyeongchang-dong, and energize... Energize me with your might. If you still have some time left, while you're at it, visit the man next door who has kind eyes, but is determined to live a miserable life. Please let him come to his senses. Can't you come home early for me? I don't expect you to love me back. I'm so bored. That's all! Can I taste it? Here. It's really delicious. My husband was wondering why you're not making any when the young skate is in season. Young radish kimchi is ready to eat too. Take some home. Thank you. By the way, is Hae-young coming to Seo-hui's wedding? Why? Shouldn't she go? No, I didn't mean that. Of course she should come. I'm just worried that Hae-young may feel awkward. It's the first time she'd see all the relatives after that. It can be awkward. Although they don't ask about it openly, there are many guesses regarding why she had to cancel the wedding. Marriage is one of the most important decisions in one's life. Obviously, there are wild guesses as it was canceled the day before. Who knows? Hae-young could have lied that she dumped him when she was dumped. Oh, dear. Honey. Oh, goodness. I don't mean that I'm the one who thinks that, but that's how others... Honey, don't. I'll stop here today. Hae-young may attend Seo-hui's wedding with a man. By the way, that man is quite handsome. He might put Seo-hui's husband in a bad light. What should I do? Should I tell him not to come? We'd better meet him as he will become our family soon, right? Is Hae-young seeing someone? He lives in Pyeongchang-dong. I heard that he runs his own business. Who is it? Pizza delivery. Yes. Honey, pizza is here. Come out and eat. -How much is it? -It's 22,000 won. Give me a second. Honey, pizza's here. Go on and pay. -Here. -Thank you. Bye. When did you get back? I didn't want to show that l live alone. That's why I acted like that. Please don't get me wrong. The furniture in the doorway. I'll push it aside. You should have a route to escape in case someone breaks in. You can install a door latch on this side. Do whatever you want. Put it by your bedside. Stop bumping into things after you turn the light off. It's noisy. I had that at home. You're not having any pizza? No, thanks. Okay. It's noisy. Do-kyeong plays cool. He says he had the music box and the lamp already at home. What if he finds out that you broke off his wedding and that you're even hitting on his ex-fiancée. She's been heartbroken already. Do I need to contribute too? I might end up cursing you too. So don't meet her. Do you call that love? Why is it so fucking beautiful? Do you like her? Do you think I'm a pervert? Dating one Oh Hae-young after another? I hope you do. One day, you'll cry because of me. Subtitle translation by
