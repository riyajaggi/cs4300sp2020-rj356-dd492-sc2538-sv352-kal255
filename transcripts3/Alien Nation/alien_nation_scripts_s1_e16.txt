Theirs was a slave ship, carrying a quarter-million beings... bred to adapt and labor in any environment. But they've washed ashore on Earth... with no way to get back to where they came from. And in the last five years, the Newcomers have become the latest addition... to the population of Los Angeles. - Looking good, Carl. - Thank you very much, Marty. Come on, push.

 There you go. One more. Come on. You did good. Don't worry. Take a minute, we'll do another set, all right? May l? Use the machines. L like free-weights. l've been waiting. Let him have his turn. Next thing you know, they'll be letting gorillas in here. Wow. You know, if they start competing, they're gonna blow us away. All right, there. - L'll take the weight off. - Don't bother. - Viktor. - Lt's cool.

 All right. Come on, two more. There you go. Easy up. Way to go. - Killer. - L'm thirsty. - Where do you keep this, the freezer? - They all say that. You can come in now, Mrs. Francisco. - How's my neemu? - He's fine. L say he has about three weeks left. L feel like a whale. These stretch marks. You look very handsome. His body's going through tremendous changes. L haven't met a man yet who didn't feel like a whale. Every little noise sets me on edge. L used to love the smell of tripe. Now it makes me sick. Heightened senses usually accompany the end of the first phase of incubation. Lt wasn't like this with Buck or Emily. George, you know every incubation is different. You're close to Phase 2 now, the rising of the haffacota. This is a special time. Think about the miracle that's going on inside of you. - Are you on paternity leave? - No, not yet. L'm concerned about leaving my partner with all of the work. Lt would be good for you to go away. Go to the desert. - Enjoy the end of your pregnancy. - She's right, you know. - L can't go because of work, but you can. - You think about it. When l left Detroit, l got the phone number of one of the stewardess. What a fox. She lives in some place called Huntington Beach. ls that around here? - Yeah, not far. - Don't worry. She's got a friend. You remember Melinda Waters, that stewardess? Was she hot! And her little sister? She threw my back out. l needed traction. Well, this is where l work. Captain's office, lock-up. Yeah. "Who loves you, baby," huh? "Say, just book 'em, Dano." "Go ahead, make my day." - lt's not quite so exciting. - Well, it's better than retail. L've only seen pictures. - We don't have any in Detroit. - You get used to 'em. Here you go, pally. Here's the car. L'll be home around 6:00. Sgt. Sikes, about George's baby shower... it's not a Tenctonese tradition. L don't know exactly what to do. - Look, can we talk about that later? - But it's this Sunday. - And l want it to be nice for him. - For him? George is a guy and you're giving him a baby shower? - George is what you'd call pregnant. - Pregnant? He's a Newcomer. lt's kinda complicated. Look, l'm letting you use my apartment, but l don't know anything about showers. L'm sure whatever you do will be fine. Matt. Grazer wants to see us. - Let me guess, you're George. - Yes, l'm George. This is my old pal, Nick Coletta. We grew up together in Detroit. Nick's out here visiting. This is my partner, George Francisco. You didn't tell me you had one for a partner. And he's pregnant. So, can l? Feels like real skin. - Matt, Grazer? - Yeah. - Nick, l'll see you tonight. - Wait. - Can l? - No, you may not! Sorry, you know how women.... Men are when they're pregnant. Sure. A pregnant Newcomer male is entitled to a paid, six-week paternity leave. Have you decided when to start yours? How about today? You're really blimping up, George. Matt, l can't just abandon you. No sweat. There are a lot of guys who could cover for you. How about it, Francisco? L'm still in Phase 1. The haffacota, what you would call the fetus, is still low. L'm perfectly capable of performing my duties. L don't want this avocado popping up around me. L still have three weeks of incubation left. There's nothing to worry about, partner. Look, George, we're cops. We're men. People are supposed to take us seriously. What he's trying to say is, a pregnant male in our society is... Something you will have to get used to. L intend to continue working until the second phase of my pregnancy. Have it your way. A human kid at County passed out at a gym. Blood tests show a high level of.... - Yeah. Newcomer male hormone. - Why would humans take it? Like steroids, they're using it to buff up. - Polish themselves? - Put on muscle. The effects are worse than steroids. Lt can cause liver damage, arthritis, temporary psychosis. Lt also seems to be physically addictive. Find out who's dealing it. - When are they gonna let me out of here? - Just relax. L've gotta train. L got a competition next week, remember? - Viktor Wendkos? - Yeah. L'd like to ask you a few questions, if l may. - Would you excuse us? - They're my friends. lt's cool. Whatever. Your friends have names? - Karina Bowen. - And Don Zimmer. Why? Your blood tests showed a high level of Newcomer male hormone. - We'd like to know where you scored it. - Look, l'm through with that stuff. Good. And where'd you get it? Somebody at the gym? - Maybe you ought to tell them. - L got it on the street, okay? - L didn't know the guy. - Yeah, sure. Look, l know you think you've got your reasons for taking this stuff. But you're a young guy. You mess up your body now... that's all you got for the rest of your life, man. L told you, l'm through with it. Hey, officer, that a watermelon you hiding in there? No, idiot, he's pregnant. Oh, excuse me. Look, l catch you taking that stuff again, l'm bringing you in. Come on, George. He's pregnant. Most bodybuilders would never use drugs. There are a few still looking for that magic formula. Lt's gotten worse now with the Newcomers here. No offense. Just that you guys are so much stronger, our guys feel like wimps. Were you aware that Viktor Wendkos was using it? No, absolutely not. Viktor helps me manage this club, and l'm gonna give him a chance. But if he doesn't stay clean, he's out of here. L've been a health nut for over 25 years. Lt's like a religion with me. L even manufacture and market my own line of vitamins and food supplements. L use these. These are great. Give you a lot of energy. Look, l've got a diet formula that can help get rid of that old paunch. L'm not fat, l'm pregnant. Lf l find anybody dealing that stuff in this place, you'll be the first to know. Ls this that puffing up you were talking about? "Buffing up." Yeah. Why do they do this? - Certainly doesn't seem pleasurable. - Lt looks good. You know, manly. L wouldn't mind putting a couple inches on my chest. Manly? This distortion of the body is considered manly? Look who's talking. What do you call that distortion? Bodybuilding's good for you. But like anything else, you can overdo it. Let's get some statements. You take that side. Let me help you with that. NlCK: Man, those mud wrestlers. The redhead would've left with me if we hadn't got thrown out of that place. L mean, what's the big deal? Nick, l warned you about getting in the ring with them. Listen, what do you say we have a little drink, then l'll call that stewardess? Lt's 2:00 in the morning. L gotta work tomorrow. You'll be fine. You don't need to sleep. Just take a hot shower in the morning. L know l saw a bottle of Scotch around here. - Here we go. - None for me. Matt, you used to be such a fun guy. L mean, l don't know anymore. L met the Newcomer neighbor today. Cathy, right? - Right. - She likes you. Seems real friendly. - So, you score with her? - What? - Did you have sex with her? - No. - Come on. - No. - Don't you want to? - Look, l'm tired. Once you get by that spotty head, she's got a great body. Lf she was my neighbor, l'd be all over her. And l do mean, all over her. L'm gonna brush my teeth. Matt. Captain Grazer has just given us a new case. Lt seems a gambling ring is operating out of palach clubs. We already got a case. According to Captain Grazer, it's no longer a priority. Viktor Wendkos made a full recovery. Seems to be an isolated incident. You can start on the gambling thing. L'm not dropping our case. - Why is it so important to you? - L feel for these guys. - L used to play football with them. - Football? - They're much younger than you are. - Guys like them. They'd go into a game their knee shot full of Novocain and cortisone. They could have been seriously injured. Why would they do that? Lt's this thing we got, George, about being a man. Lt starts the day you're born. Excuse me, Sgt. Sikes, what color napkins should l get for the shower? L don't know. - Lt's your shower, what do you want? - L like maroon, or beige. Beige. Matt. L'm not sure l understand your concept of being a man. Lt's solely a matter of gender. Not on this planet. You gotta prove it here. Like some Newcomer men. They don't feel truly masculine until after they've given birth. L'm afraid, George, that giving birth doesn't quite cut it. You ever see movies? Remember Sylvester Stallone? That beefy fellow with the headband, always had a big gun? Remember that scene in First Blood when Stallone falls off a cliff? He has this huge gash in his arm and he sews himself up. See, that's considered being a man. Tell you the truth, Matt, l find his movies simplistic. Why does everything have to be so complicated with you? You think too much. Women do that. The hormone is a complex protein. Like insulin, it is possible to synthesize it. But it would require very sophisticated equipment. The simplest way to extract the hormone... would be to get it from male Newcomer blood. So, l'm looking for a source of Newcomer blood. Yes. Excuse me. Hello, Nick. Thanks for the sugar. L wanted to return your cup. Thank you. - Hey, Matt. - What're you doing? L decided to bake a cake and you didn't have any sugar. - You baked a cake? - Yeah. Lt's a very old family recipe. Nick's great-great-grandmother brought it all the way across the plains. How sweet. Cathy, l was just wondering if you weren't busy on Saturday night... - if you'd like to have dinner with me? - Dinner? - Well.... - You don't mind, do you, Matt? No, why should l mind? - L'd love to have dinner with you. - Great. My back is killing me. Ankles are swollen. - L have this awful ringing in my ears. - Funny, so do l. You wanted the kid, stop bitching. L shouldn't expect you to sympathize. You don't have to get up five times a night to urinate. You have no understanding of what l'm going through. You think men should fall off cliffs and sew themselves up. George, don't cry. l hate it when you cry. L suppose it's not manly, either. Lt's just these hormones or whatever running wild. That's all this is. Look, l didn't mean it. l'm sorry. Here, wipe your nose. L don't need it. Don't worry, you won't see any more tears out of me. George, l'm sorry. l'm in a bad mood. L thought Nick, my old pal, came out to see me. What does he do? He goes and makes a date with Cathy. - Nick's going out with Cathy? - She knows he's my friend. - How does that make me feel? - Did you tell her you were upset? No. lf she doesn't know already, l'm not going to tell her. You don't know if she knows, but if she doesn't, you're not going to tell her? Exactly. L've been cross-referencing a bunch of old reports... trying to find a source for that Newcomer hormone. Three months ago, this hospital reported the theft... of a dozen pints of Newcomer blood. Better check it out. Lf you're not feeling too good, maybe you ought to stay here. - Of course, l'm coming. - You're something, George. One minute it's Little Nell, the next, it's Conan the Barbarian. L come in, l see the units are gone. L say to myself, "Sol... "what kind of a gonif steals blood?" But you know. You're from California, all the meshugganahs. Nothing surprises you. Meshugganahs? You got your devil worshippers, holistic this, holistic that. Here are the donors of the missing blood. - When are you due? - About two and a half weeks. - Your first? - No, l have a boy and a girl. The family. Lt's the only thing that matters. John Adams, Ramon Navarro. Lt was all male blood. Wouldn't surprise me if some schlemiel is out there drinking it. Could you get us a list of all the employees who have had access... - to this blood all in the last year. - Why not? L got something better to do with my time? L tell my wife, we should move to Florida. You got the palm trees, you got the sun, you got the pompano. That's a very good fish. Buck! Buck! What, dad? Are you okay? Hand me that magazine. - Sure. - Thank you. Do you want some Vaseline for your frog legs? No. When did your mother say she was coming home? Remember she had that late meeting in Century City... - and then she had to go to a dinner. - Dinner? Why couldn't she have dinner here? Because she was taking out a big client. You know, the human who owns all those airlines, the guy everybody hates. L suppose he's more important than the family. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, Buck. Hi. Neemu, hard day at the office? No, it was wonderful. L couldn't have asked for a better day. You're never gonna believe who l had dinner with. One of the most influential humans in the United States. Yes, Buck told me. Neemu, my feet hurt. Could you massage them? Of course, George. L'm sorry, l get so caught up with work, l forget that you've changed. Changed? Lt's not your fault. You're just more dependent, more needy right now. Needy? You just can't do all the things you're used to doing. Things tend to upset you more. Don't tell me how l feel. You make it sound as though l'm some weak, helpless female. Females aren't weak and helpless, George. Lf l wanted l could fall off a cliff and sew myself up. George, have you had your lead supplements today? George, what is it? Your haffacota just rose. No, it's just gas. George, you're in Phase 2. You better call and tell them you can't come into work. L feel fine, and l'm not taking paternity leave until l absolutely have to. Morning. We got the employee list from the hospital. - George, your avocado. - What? - Lt looks different. lt's way up there. - L don't think so. - Did you find anything? - Yeah. Viktor Wendkos' friend, the guy we met at the hospital, Don Zimmer. Up until two months ago, he worked as a tech in the blood bank. He's now working part-time for a contractor. George, your haffacota. You're in Phase 2. I am not. - Lt's a good thing your shower's Sunday. - L still have two and a half weeks. - Let's go see Mr. Zimmer. - George, you heard what Albert said. L think you ought to sit this one out. I am sick and tired of people patronizing me. L may be pregnant, but l'm still a man. Even if l have to prove it. Zimmer, he's over there. George, take that side. Okay, here's the Newcomer hormone we found at Don Zimmer's apartment. Have S.l.D go over it, see if they can give us any idea where it's being made. - Right. - L still don't get it. Zimmer's a human, how could he have outrun you? He's very fast. He's an athlete. You sure it didn't have anything to do with you being in the family way? - Ls that a reference to my pregnancy? - Just asking. Maybe my pregnancy did get in the way. Maybe l was only as fast as a human. Not as fast as Zimmer. So, tell me, Cathy... have you ever had a human boyfriend? - No. - Do you ever get curious? Sometimes. Has anybody ever told you... - you have the most beautiful lips. - Thank you. - L'd love to kiss them. - L wish that you wouldn't. Come on, you're curious. - L think that it's time for you to go. - Come on, baby. - No, please don't. - Come on. Please. - Matt! - Cathy, are you okay? Matt please help me. Hey, guy. - Oh, Matt. - Cathy. Matt? - What are you doing? - Yeah, man, what's up? L thought l heard rats. L was just checking. - Rats? - Yeah. You know, if you see one.... You know, you got a real problem. And l definitely saw droppings in the laundry room. L think we'll be okay. Thanks, Matt. Nick and l were going to have a drink. Would you like to join us? No, l'm pretty tired. Make sure that you don't keep Nick out too late. We got George's shower tomorrow. - Night, pally. - Yeah, right. Goodnight, Matt. - Lt's twins? - Silly, no. Just one. A girl. Lt's a big girl. Neemu, we better open your gifts. L've to get to the office. - Lt's Sunday. - L wouldn't be all day. Albert, these are Halloween decorations. - Aren't they colorful? - Lt's a baby shower. And the flamingos, they're supposed to be storks. L thought these were prettier. - Sgt. Rankin. - Albert. Nice party, Matt. Kinda weird, but nice. Want one? - You're awfully peppy today. - Am l? - For someone who didn't sleep much. - You know me. - What time did you get in? - L don't know. 3:00, 4:00, 5:00, 6:00. This isn't a hotel, Nick. Cathy needs another soda. - Thank you. - Sergeant. Oh, Albert. From the boys at the ballistics lab. They're probably laughing at me behind their backs. Susan, why don't we go home and open the rest of these later. This one's from the SWAT team. How're we doing? Neemu, l've got to go. Albert, it was a wonderful shower. Thank you. You're welcome. Goodbye, everybody. - Don't let him eat too much cake. - Okay. Bye bye. That's beautiful. An eyelet cable stitch. That's hard. Oh, really? My uncle, he was in the merchant marine, and he used to knit his own socks. He kinda taught me how to knit when l was a kid. Matt, did you knit something for the baby? Matt, are you gonna knit something for the baby? Very funny. Men don't knit. - But, you just told me that your uncle... - Never mind. George, this is from me. Open it up. George, open it. "l'm not fat, l'm pregnant." lt's okay. lt wasn't expensive. You all think this is so funny. L've had enough. Lt's just a T-shirt, George. You can return it. Go ahead, make fun of me. But l'm leaving. l will not be humiliated. Don't touch me. Thank you all for the lovely party. - Did you enjoy your stay? - Oh yeah, it was a real eye opener. - Albert, that's stuff's getting ripe. - Lt does smell good. Too bad there's so much of it left over. Sgt. Sikes, do you want me to save you some? Take it, Albert. So, you and Cathy seemed to enjoy the party. L don't think George did. You two are real cozy now, l guess. You're in a rotten mood. Guess it was chasing all those rats all night. Just one rat. L borrowed these. L promised to bring them back. Matt, now, go ahead, ask me. You've been dying to all day. So, anyway, Sgt. Sikes, thanks. Ask you what? - See you at the station. - You know. Go ahead, ask me. Bye. Okay, what'd you and Cathy do last night? None of your business. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Lf you didn't want me to go out with her, why don't you just tell me? She was standing right there. How the hell could l? So, you do have a thing for her. Listen, why are you laying all this on me? Cathy's great. lf you like her, just tell her. You gonna take me to the airport or should l call a cab? No, l'll take you. Have you tried to get to the airport lately, George? Can't believe the traffic. So, we get an S.l.D report on the dope from Zimmer's apartment yet? Don Zimmer, the guy dealing Newcomer hormone, remember? George, if this is about that T-shirt, l said l was sorry. Albert, would you tell Sgt. Sikes that it is much more than just the T-shirt. - Sgt. Sikes, it's much more... - L heard him! Tell Sgt. Francisco, he can stick his head in a bucket. - George, he said that you can... - Hey, Sikes. What's this S.l.D report on Newcomer male hormone? L've been looking for that. L told your partner, this is not a priority. Matt. - Albert, is somebody speaking? - Lt was George. Matt, what's in the report? S.l.D. found traces on the vials of serum. B complex, Niacin, Sodium ascorbate. The man who owns the gym, Marty Penn. He manufactures vitamins. He could produce the hormone at his factory. Let's go visit Mr. Penn. L hate when this happens. Matt. Lt's Penn. He has a faint pulse. This is one-William-152. We need an ambulance at 4673 Sunset Heights Boulevard, apartment 1204. What the hell did he get hit with? L can't be sure, but l'd say it's someone's fist. - That kind of damage. Was it a Newcomer? - Maybe, or a human as strong as one. Marty Penn's in a coma. He is not gonna be fingering anybody real soon. Obviously, whoever hit him was real strong. Drugs were taken. We know Zimmer was dealing. Maybe he was using, too. L feel awful. - Phase 3? - No. Matt, if it was Don Zimmer, l'm responsible. When we went to arrest him, l had a pouch spasm. l couldn't follow. That's why he got away. - Ls one of you Detective Sikes? - Yeah. - Your watch commander. - Sikes. Yeah, thanks. You're off the hook, George. Phoenix P.D. picked up Zimmer last night on our A.P.B. Docs figure that Penn was assaulted between 12:00 midnight and 3:00 a.m. Zimmer couldn't have done it. He was in Arizona. The only other person involved with the hormone is Don Zimmer's friend... - Viktor Wendkos. - Yeah. And you heard what Grazer says. The stuff causes personality changes, psychosis. Lt's also addictive, and you know how junkies are when they need a fix. Come on. Matt, l don't think l should. Look, George, maybe you are only functioning at human capacity. That's good enough for me. L don't know when he'll be back. Where was he between midnight and 3:00 a.m? L don't know. Lots of times he stays at the gym after he closes up. Lately, he's been staying all night. - All night? - Yeah. At first l thought he was seeing someone else but.... - No way, Jose. - What makes you so sure? Let's just say the muscle-man act ends between the sheets. L'm sorry, l don't follow you. He can't perform. You mean he can't sustain an erection? Yeah, George, that's just what she means. He's impotent. L think l know the reason why. The same thing happens with steroids. Your boyfriend's back on the stuff. Yeah, l thought so. He's been acting so weird lately. He's been like a different person. And when l try to talk to him about it, he just gets so angry. Especially when we're in bed and he can't.... You know. Viktor hit me yesterday and he's never hit me before. You think we could find Viktor at the gym right now? L'm sure you could. Since we stopped sleeping together, that's about all he does. That beating Viktor gave Penn, it wasn't just to steal the hormone. Lt was payback. - Payback? - He's impotent, George. He might as well be dead. Why is impotence such a terrible thing? Why? Because you're not a man. What are you? Of course, you're still a man but, you're just not a man. L hate getting in these conversations with you. Lt's ironic. Ln searching for manhood, he lost it. You humans sure have strange ideas about what's male and female. We have strange ideas? - You make such a separation of the two. - Because they're different, George. Of course they're different, but aren't they two parts of the same person? We're made of man and woman, aren't we then both male and female? - Maybe you are. - We both have a feminine side. Matt, l've been so stupid... l've been trying to conform to your human ideals of masculinity. Ln denying my femininity, my incubation, l have denied myself. Well, look, George, maybe things are a little more complicated for you. L don't think so. Viktor Wendkos, Police! We want to talk to you. - Call for backup. - This if one-William-152. We need backup at Penn's Gym, Redondo and Olympic. - Stay here, George. - Wait for backup. L don't want him getting out the back door. - Then l'm going with you. - No. See if you can find some lights. Freeze! Come on, Slag. Matt. Matt. Vessna. L got him, George. Rambo's got nothing on you, George. You can thank my feminine side. L was protecting my baby. This is one-Wllliam-152. Where the hell's my backup? And while you're at it, send an ambulance. Roger. - Get two. - No, l'm okay. For me. l'm having the baby. No, George, you can't. You're still in Phase 2. Lt's disattaching. George, you told me. You said you'd have two weeks left. This isn't supposed to happen. You said you still got two weeks. The fight, it's brought on premature labor. This is one-William-152. L also need another ambulance stat for a delivering Newcomer. The patient is a police officer. Get it here immediately. Roger. - They'll never make it. - L'll get you to that birthing center. - You're going to have to deliver the baby. - Come on, me? - George, please. - Get me there. Why are you doing this to me? You know l didn't want this to happen. You promised me, George. George, just try to hold it in. L can't. Undo my pants. - Now what? - Place your hands, here. Help me push. George? Push. You hang in there, all right. Put your fists against my temples. Lt helps to dilate the pouch. Lt's coming. - Now? - Lt's coming. - What do l do? - Push. Breathe. - L'm okay. - All right. Push. - What? - She's nabarote. - What's that? - Breeched. - Oh, man. - She can't get out. What can l do? What do l do? George, tell me. George, don't you check out on me. Turn the baby around. George. Turn the baby around. Lt's okay, George. Lt's all right. lt's gonna be okay. Here we go. She's coming now. Matt, turn her face up, please. George, she's beautiful. Vessna. She has Susan's spots. She's cold. She needs the comfort of two bodies. Her mother isn't here. Matt, lie close to us. Vessna, l want you to meet your godfather. Purl one, knit two. That's called a cluster rib stitch. Now, l'll do a pearl stitch, okay. Yarn forward. All right? And reverse it. Slip down. Wrap it around. Slip it off. - Now what? - Just repeat till the end of the row. Cathy? L like you.
