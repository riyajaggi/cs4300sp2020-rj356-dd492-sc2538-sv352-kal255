 Well guys, I'm really gonna miss you. Oh, Who's a good boy? Thanks for watching the pets while we're gone to the State Spelling Bee, Marsha. No problem. Well, uh, I hope it's not a problem. They are kind of hyperactive. You'll be fine, but watch out for Bunnicula. Sometimes I think he waits until you turn your back to cause trouble! Ha! I'm just messing with you.

 Okay, here's the list of all of Chester's allergies and medications. On Page 45, you'll find his emergency... And on Addendum D... Come on Mina, time to skedaddle. Skedaddle, S-K-E-D-A-D-L-E. Skedaddle. Now, now, now. Remember the rule. I before E, except after three. All right guys, wish me luck. Just kidding. I don't need it. Uh, okay. See you in a couple days. Oh, Mina! And Z after W, unless it's a leap year.

 Got it, Dad. Poor Bunnic. He's developed a nasty case of separation anxiety. Come on, you're overreacting. I mean, she might be the most important person in our lives but that's no reason to be upset. - Yeah. - Not like she's never coming back. Yeah. And it's not like the end of the world as we know it. Yeah. I miss her so much. Is it me? Do you guys not like me? I can change. I can change. I know what would cheer you guys up. Here you go, Harold. A nice helping of kibble. And for Chester, we have some Dandy Cat's Delight. And for Bunnicula, a nice juicy carrot. Well, two out of three ain't bad. - Oh man, Bunnicula's really taking this Mina thing bad. Hey buddy. You okay? She's only gonna be gone for the weekend. No reason to be upset. I know it's hard, Bunnic. But trust us, she's gonna be back. Yeah, she ain't absquatulating. Yeah, she's not... Wait, what does that mean? Oh, come on, Chester. Don't you start absquatulating. Well, no, I've just never heard that word before. I'm just not sure if it's like a workout for your abs or... Or are you talking about a vegetable? I... Look, Bunnic... Where'd he go? Maybe he needed some time to himself. Yeah, you're probably right. And I was the original owner of Lucy. I ran a cantaloupe farm out of Buffalo, New York. Back before you could say it was cool to do that. Lucy was featured in over seven films and documentaries. Oh, someday, I'll have the glamorous life of a TV cantaloupe. Huh? What is happening? Boy, sure is windy today huh, Chester? We're indoors, big guy. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Oh. Huh? Wait, what? Hey, why you absquatulating me? I really don't think that means what you think that means. Huh? Ah! Oh. Oh... This is not worth $20. Please don't be there. Please don't be there. Please don't be there. Woah! Whoa! - Huh? - Did she just absquatulate on us? Yup. Ah! Help! Run! Do you think it's still after us? Hello? Anybody in here? Any sign of the ghost? Harold, quit pushing. Well, I'm hungry. Been hiding for two whole days. Yeah, I'm hungry too. We need Bunnicula to protect us from the ghost. Where is Bunnicula anyway? Ah! Ugh. A rotten yam? With bite marks? Hmm. Bunny tracks? Hmm. Bunnicula? Are you down there? I've got a nice juicy carrot for you. Not so loud, Chester. The ghost might hear you. I told you, Harold. It's not a ghost. It's Bunnicula. Oh, that's right. I forgot. Ah! The ghost is attacking. It's Bunnicula, Harold. There is no ghost. Bunnicula, we found a dried up yam in the kitchen and I'm guessing it turned you invisible. - We can't hear you or see you. - Hmm. Just stand right here. Harold, get the flour. Okay, Chester. The ghost looks just like Bunnicula. Ahhh! It is Bunnicula, Harold. Oh yeah, I forgot. I figure if we flush out your system, we might be able to reverse the effects of the yam. Then, hopefully you can help us get rid of this ghost. In just a few minutes, you should be as good as new. There you are, a whole box of farm fresh carrots. Eat up. Uh, what was that? No more! I've had enough of you! Ha! Get back here! Be gone! Why don't you leave me alone! Harold, quick! We gotta distract Marsha. You can only push a girl so far! Chester, what are you... Bunnicula, go for the carrots! Don't worry, guys. I'll protect you. Huh? Mina's home. Wait. Mina's home! Bunnicula, Mina's on her way. You have to get to those carrots now! Ahhh! I'm not sure what dictionary those judges were using, but back in my day, qualification was spelled with a K. That's okay, Dad. I got my trophy. It's not like I'm gonna be a speller when I grow up anyway. Well, time to get back to... - Uh... - Mina! Oh, Buns, I missed you so much. I would've spelled the heck out of that bee, had you been there. Whoa! Hey, guys, did you miss me? Well, little lady, the house looks great. Here's your $20. Your house is haunted. I was chased by a ghost. A ghost! Uh... $25! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
