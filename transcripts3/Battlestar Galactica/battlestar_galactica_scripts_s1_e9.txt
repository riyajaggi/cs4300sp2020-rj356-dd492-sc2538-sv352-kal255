 NARRATOR: PreviousIy on Battlestar Galactica. (DRAMATlC lNSTRUMENTAL MUSlC) l notice you're calling her Sharon now. NO. 6: She acts like one of them, thinks like them. She's one of them. But she's one of us. BOOMER: We gotta go. Now. We gotta travel fast. Even faster than before. ROSLlN: They found him in the starboard storage compartment. He's another copy of the Cylon you know as Leoben. l'll send a team over to destroy it.

 Anything it says cannot be trusted. Don't! Adama is a Cylon. (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) Commander? Here's Dr. Baltar's report. And the President is waiting for you up in the core. Thank you. ADAMA: Clear the deck. Madam President, we are the proud owners of the universe's first, bona-fide Cylon detector. That is great news. Yeah. So, when do we begin? Dr. Baltar would like to start

 widespread testing as soon as possible but there are some serious limitations. He can only do one person at a time, and verification takes hours. So who's going to go first? (SlGHlNG) The tests. Right. l think people in sensitive positions should go first. l completely agree. How about you? Excuse me? lf you're a Cylon, l'd like to know. (LAUGHS) lf l'm a Cylon, you're really screwed. (CHUCKLlNG) Seriously, l do think that you should go first. Show everyone in the fleet that they can trust the people at the top. Then maybe you should go first. All right, l'll go first. l think that's good. l do. PlLOT: Bank on my advice. (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) They always do that? No, they're just showing off. They know l'm in here. Oh ! You date a special assistant to the President, word gets out. So this is officially a date? Jury's still out. (CHUCKLES) MAN: Observation deck has two minutes remaining. You could pull rank. You could tell them you're on special business for the President of the Colonies. Your boss pulls more weight around here than mine. You can tell them Adama wants you to. . . Yeah, what? Wants me to what? l lost my train of thought. Mmm-hmm. How is he these days, by the way? The old man? He's fine, l guess. You guess? He's been acting kind of funny lately. Seems distracted or something. He's been making all these weird calls from his quarters. Super secret. Probably a security thing. They don't want me to log the calls, though. No trace file. Nothing. And this just started? A few days ago. Billy Keikeya, are you pumping me for information about the old man? DECK HAND: Time's up. No. Of course not. You are. You are. You're a spy, that's what you are. l was just asking a couple of questions. l hope you liked the answers. Because they're the last ones you're gonna get for a while. ROSLlN: What did you find out? Dualla couldn't put her finger on it but, yeah, she said he's been acting differently. l could see that myself. He was distracted and unfocused. What else? Some scrambled wireless calls he didn't want logged. She didn't know who he called or why. But none of this is damning evidence. The calls could be security-related and his odd behavior could be stress, pure and simple. Exhaustion, paranoia. . . All right. lt could be any of those things. But what if it's not? Madam President, with all due respect, l cannot believe we're actually entertaining the idea that Commander Adama has been somehow replaced by a Cylon duplicate. Oh, my Gods, Billy, l hope you're right. (THEME MUSlC) ls suicide really a sin? NO. 6: A mortal one, l'm afraid. But it's not that bad, is it, Gaius? 47,905 people in the fleet. 47,905 blood samples. BALTAR: 1 1 hours to test each one for Cylon indicators. That'll take awhile. 21 ,956 days. NO. 6: 60. 1 534 years. Now, let's figure in a few hours to sleep here and there. We'll call it an even 61 , shall we? Sure. l prefer to kill myself. (CLEARS THROAT) Commander Adama, are you a Cylon? Tune in tomorrow. No. lt's hard being a genius. Yes. There should be some perks. Yes. (BEEPlNG) (BALTAR LAUGHlNG) (BALTAR MOANS) (ZlPPER UNFASTENlNG) (NO. 6 MOANlNG) (BALTAR PANTlNG) (BALTAR MOANlNG) STARBUCK: What's up, Doc? Lieutenant Thrace, good to see you. l was just keeping up with the old exercises. That should do me for today. (CHUCKLlNG) l feel a lot better. What brings you to the lab at this time of the night? lt's the middle of the afternoon. Yeah, it is. Crazy workload. l totally lose track of time. So, what can l do for you? You can zip up your fly. So. . . My blood test. You're right about one thing, Gaius. There is something very intriguing about her. Very good. Very good. (SlGHS) At least l did that much. (BEEPlNG) Dradis, contact! Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005. Galactica, Apollo. Action stations. Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005. This is not a drill. Close with enemy, destroy. Acknowledge. APOLLO: We're on it, Galactica. He jumped right in front of us. His mistake. How many? Single Raider. Looks like a recon patrol. Apollo and Beehive have them in their sight. TlGH: Where's the old man? He's not aboard. Not aboard? Where the hell is he? He left in a Raptor about an hour ago. No flight plan. No flight plan? That's it, Beehive. You set him up, l'll knock him down. (FlRlNG) APOLLO: l winged him. Looks Iike I got his weapon systems. (STUTTERlNG) He jumped. He jumped away before we could zero him out. Damn it. Probably giving away our position to every Cylon base ship right now. Where in the hell is the old man? Order the fleet to execute emergency jump procedures. Everyone rendezvous at the stand-by coordinates. Contact! Single Raider bearing 881 carom 247. Apollo, Galactica, Cylon Raider detected at 881 carom 24. . . APOLLO: Wait, l see him! lt's the same Raider. What? lt's the same Raider. l can see the damage from before. It's behaving erraticaIIy. He jumped away again. Contact. Single Raider, same telltales. lt's like he's just flying around in circles. Wounded bird. Can't fly home. APOLLO: Galactica. We got him on Dradis, but he's pretty far out there. Take us three minutes to cIose to weapons range. No. This is our perfect chance to get some intel. Order Apollo to close with the Raider, but do not engage. Put a Raptor in the air. As long as that's flopping around out there, tell them l want to suck in every electronic signal it makes. Sir. Colonel, Commander Adama's Raptor is requesting permission to enter the landing pattern. Permission granted. Stand down to Condition Two. DUALLA: Permission granted. Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck. (MAN CHATTERlNG ON PA) Permission to come aboard, sir. TlGH: Granted. Mind telling me where the hell you've been? Colonel Tigh, allow me to present your wife. Ellen. (CYLONS WHlRRlNG) (HELO PANTlNG) HELO: That noise. l don't get it. l've blown Centurions away before. They've never sent an entire army after me. BOOMER: They're after me. Why you? While they were holding me, l overheard some things. What? Plans. Deployments. There's a big Cylon base at Delphi. A major hub. Delphi? Frakking bastards. The best place to try to grab a ship and get off this frakking planet. (BOTH PANTlNG) (PHONE BUZZlNG) Dr. Gaius Baltar, Department of Cylon Detection, how may l direct your call? ROSLlN: You're in a good mood. Madame President. . . l'm sorry. l was expecting someone else. We haven't spoken in ages. Doctor, l'd like you to call me the moment Commander Adama's test is complete. Will you do that? Commander Adama canceled his test a short time ago. Why? l don't know. He gave me another sample. He said it had priority. Whose? l'll just check. Some woman called Ellen. No surname. He dropped it off and left. ls there a problem? Dr. Baltar, l would like you to resume testing Commander Adama's blood sample immediately. Thank you. (PHONE CLlCKS) l can't believe you're alive. (CHUCKLlNG) l can't believe it myself. (CHUCKLlNG) Saul, l don't remember the last few weeks. lt's weeks, right? Right. You've been on the Rising Star all this time? l guess so. The last thing l remember is being on Picon. l was at the airport buying a ticket home and hearing something about the Cylons. And then just dreams, mostly dreams until a couple days ago. They tell me l was knocked out when the Cylons attacked the airport. And someone just picked me up and put me on the last flight out. Some savior. l don't even know who. lt's all right. You're here now. STARBUCK: lt's like we found a treasure chest. One of the major issues we've been having with the Raider we captured is trying to figure out the faster-than-light drive. This wounded bird is jumping all over the place out there. Yeah. And every time it jumps, it gives us more data that we can use. But what was it doing out there, and how long can he keep it up? The moment you have your FTL data, give me an update. Let's not let this thing linger out there longer than we have to. TYROL: Yes, sir. You wanted to see me, sir? Stay on it. You have dinner plans? What? Come on. ELLEN: l never thought l'd see your face again. Me neither. The things l said before, the things l did. . . (SHUSHlNG) ln the past. lt's all in the past. Start over? Start over. (PHONE BUZZlNG) l can't. Forget it. l can't. l'm on duty. (PHONE CONTlNUES BUZZlNG) XO. Now? Understood. All right. Tell her l'm on my way. Girlfriend? (LAUGHS) Official business. Feels like old times. l'd explain, but. . . lt's classified. l'll be back as soon as l can. Okay. l'll be here, waiting. As soon as l can. (DOOR OPENlNG) (DOOR CLOSES) You want to be very, very careful with what you just said. You're talking about a man l owe my life to, many times over. l know these are uncertain times and this has been a difficult transition for you. Excuse me, Colonel. l do appreciate how difficult this is for you to hear, believe me. But l would advise you right now not to say anything that you will regret. l need to know if you have seen anything suspicious about his recent behavior. No. What about the fact that he left the Galactica without telling anyone where he was going or when he would return, and at that very moment, a Cylon Raider jumped into view and started acting strangely? l know exactly where he was. You do? He was picking up my wife. Your wife? Turns out she's been unconscious aboard the Rising Star ever since the attack. Oh, my Gods! That's fantastic. That's amazing. Yes, it is. When Ellen stepped off that shuttle, l thought l was going to pass out. Ellen? Your wife's name is Ellen? Yes, it is. Ellen. Ellen Tigh. l'd very much like to meet your wife, Colonel. Resume the test on Ellen? No, it's no trouble at all. (DOOR CLANGS) Ellen? Did you shut the door? l already did. (BOTH MURMUR) Surprise. Ambrosia? Where did you get this? (LAUGHlNG) l have my ways. l thought it might be just the thing for a little celebration. We need to talk. First things first. There. Starting over. l'm technically still on duty. (EXCLAlMS) l think they can do without you for a day. lt doesn't really work that way. (BOTH BREATHlNG HARD) Starting over. (GlGGLlNG) Sure, there's whining and complaining like you would expect but the people l talked to are mostly hopeful and optimistic. That's good to hear. (EXCLAlMS) There are a few people who still might wonder if a kindergarten teacher is really the right person to be President but they're just a tiny, tiny minority. (ELLEN LAUGHS) Wonderful. Everyone is so truly grateful to all of you on Galactica. You literally are our saviors. We're just doing our jobs. You are so modest. (BOTH LAUGH) He's always been that way. (GLASSES CLlNKlNG) (EXCLAlMS) Lee, could l trouble you for a little bit more of this lovely Ambrosia? Sure. Thank you, dear. Bill, you must be so proud of your sons. Lee here has grown into such a handsome man. l can only imagine what Zak must look like now. You are the spitting image of your mother and l bet Zak takes just after his daddy. Zak passed away a couple of years ago. l'm sorry. How tragic, the death of a child. There's been so much death, so much pain. Sometimes it's completely overwhelming. l'm sure he was a beautiful boy. The Captain of the Rising Star was puzzled as to how you got on his ship. l know. l know some thoughtful soul just rescued me from almost certain death, and put me on the last flight out of Picon. How lucky for us all. Yes, indeed. The strange thing is no one can recall giving you any medical assistance until about a week ago. l know. lt's a miracle l'm alive. (EXCLAlMS) l think l better clear some of these dishes. You are so sweet. Very good. My compliments to the chef. So, Bill, now the question on everyone's mind, and l do mean everyone. . . APOLLO: Sorry. lt's okay. . . .is where is Earth and when do we get there? That's classified information. That word again. Leave the man alone. Come on, if there are no privileges of being an XO's wife, then what's the point? Bill, we're all family here. Come on. The need for secrecy is paramount, Ellen. l'm sorry. Perhaps you don't know that the Cylons look like us now. That, yes, l knew that. lt's recent news. Most people found out a few days ago. A thing like that would travel fast. Right? Any one of us could be a Cylon. Boo! (TlGH AND ELLEN LAUGHlNG) Did you see the looks on their faces? You are too easy. Thank you so much for coming. lt's been a wonderful evening. TlGH: Thought it would never end. l seemed to have lost one of my shoes. l think it's right here. Thank you. Here we are. You look very, very happy. That's because l am very happy. Thank you. (EXCLAlMlNG) (BOTH LAUGHlNG) lt was nice to see you again. The pleasure's all mine. Hope to see you soon. l'm sure you will. (BOTH LAUGHlNG) Hang on. Watch your step. Good night. Lovely evening. l've got her. Be careful. You actually think that woman is a Cylon? lf she's not, then we're all in a lot of trouble. When did Bill become such a stick-in-the-mud? The man's a carving. He's one of those faces on a totem pole. The scuttlebutt was that she slept with more than half the fleet while Saul was in space. Why the hell did he stay married to her? lt's obvious. He loves her deeply. Blindly. Ellen used to encourage the worst instincts in this guy, bring out this self-destructive streak in him. Used to? HELO: Sharon, stop! l can't keep up. (HELO COUGHlNG) BOOMER: Helo, come on. You can do it. You can. Please. You have to get up. There. Right there. (HELO PANTlNG) (HELO COUGHlNG) Turn your light off. (RUMBLlNG) We gotta find another way out of here. We're going. Why aren't you waiting? You keep going and going. You never get tired. lt's adrenaline. l'm not gonna die here. And l'm not gonna let you die here either. Okay, let's go! (HELO GRUNTlNG) TlGH: Don't worry, l'll get us home. Yeah, right. Just like Bill's getting us to Earth. Don't start on Bill. (GRUNTS) He doesn't have the slightest idea where Earth is. You don't have to yell it through the halls. Bill Adama doesn't know where Earth is! Colonel. Doctor. (WHOOPlNG) Actually, l don't believe l've had the pleasure. l'm Dr. Gaius. . . ELLEN: Baltar. l know exactly who you are. And the pleasure's all mine. Something here, isn't there? You're still holding my hand. That's funny. l thought you were still holding onto mine. l'm watching you. Both of you. And you should be watching her. Care to join us for a nightcap, Doctor? l'd love to. MAN ON PA: Dr. Baltar, pIease report to the Iab. The Commander is waiting for you. But l can't. Another time, perhaps. Count on it. Ta-ta! Oh, Saulie, are you jealous? You said we were starting over. We are, sweetheart, we are. That was just a little bit of harmless flirting. (MOANS) You should know something. What? ln the middle of dinner Bill put his hand on my leg. Ellen, l'm not falling for this. Did you know he came to see me on the Rising Star? What? He'd come into my room. l'd pretend to be asleep. Then he'd sit by the side of my bed and then he'd touch me. Why are you doing this? You're lying. l am not! He was on that ship. l'll prove it. Come on ! Look, it's not magic. lt's science. lf you want the right result, you have to wait a while. l gave you her sample this morning. l have started and stopped the test twice already now so l'm running a little behind. Twice? Twice? My fault. Long story. Your fault? l shouldn't have mentioned that. You shouldn't have. Did you tell him to stop Ellen's test? Yes, l did. Why? l had some concerns. About what? ln all honesty, l think it's fair to say that your behavior recently has been odd. My behavior? What do you think, l'm a Cylon? Me? You can't deny that you've been making these off-log calls, these mysterious trips off the ship. Where did you hear that? Have you been spying on me? On my own ship? Ladies and gentlemen, please. We're in a laboratory. There are hazardous chemical compounds everywhere. That's a thermo-nuclear bomb, for frak's sakes. What do you mean "un-logged"? "Mysterious trips"? What's going on? l had to go to the Rising Star and l didn't want Tigh to know. Why not? Because whether or not his wife is a Cylon, she's nothing but trouble and l wanted to keep her away from him as long as l could. Then why did you bring her aboard the ship? Because she's his wife. And l couldn't refuse her access to her own husband without causing suspicion. Besides, l wanted her close to me. l told you. l told you he wanted me. Lovely. TlGH: What the hell's going on? You have been secretly visiting my wife? No. Yes. But it's complicated. l told you. He's been after me for years. What? Now, boys, boys, don't fight over little old me. Ellen, be quiet! You don't tell me what to do. We should all take a deep breath. l will ! l was afraid that she might be a Cylon ! l brought her blood here to have it tested. That's why you canceled your test. How'd you know about that? You didn't tell me he was testing my wife. You met with the President? Yes. She thought you might be a Cylon. l know. MAN ON PA: Attention. Pass the word for the Commander, the XO and the CAG. Commander Adama, Colonel Tigh, and Captain Adama, please report to ClC. (WHlRRlNG SOUND) Mr. Gaeta. The Raider smoothed out its flight path about two minutes ago. lt seems to be under control. Yeah, but he's not jumping for home. No, sir, he isn't. Has our reconnaissance detected any outgoing communications since he straightened out his flight pattern? Yes, sir, but it's likely it's just another distress signal. Launch the alert fighters. This is the CAG. Launch the alert fighters. Sir, l hate to tell you this, but l think it's been playing with us the entire time, just waiting to see how we'd react. Playing with us? Yeah. Order the flight leader to destroy the target! Yes, sir. (WHOOPlNG) Galactica, Hot Dog. The Raider just took off! He doesn't look injured to me. He's heading back to the fleet! They're not going to catch him. Action Stations, set Condition One. This is not a drill. He doesn't have any weapons. He's on a suicide run. Did you launch the alert fighters? lt was the XO's call. l had a hunch. Good call. One question. Because l was worried. That she might be a Cylon. And if she wasn't? l know how you feel about her, Saul. She's been a negative force in your life. l'm sorry, but it's the truth. Maybe she was. Everything was different then. She was different. l was different. l've grown accustomed to seeing you without the cup in your hand. So l had a couple of drinks tonight. l was celebrating. l think l deserved to. . . Yes, you did. Launching those fighters on a hunch. You saved our ship. Just doing my job. You do your job good. That's why l need you, Saul. That, and that we're friends. l don't want anything to come between that, not even Ellen. lt won't. DORAL: We've searched every street, every building. They slipped through. How's that possible? She thinks she loves him now. That she can't live without him. Her passion is making her more resourceful. lt bothers you, doesn't it? We'll get them in the end. No, it bothers you that you've never experienced it. (CHUCKLlNG) You saw the way Helo was when we took her away? He was pathetic. l can't help wondering what it would be like to feel that intensely. Even in his anguish, he seemed so alive. Green. Green, everyone. Mrs. Tigh is definitely human. No hard feelings, l hope, Ellen. l completely understand. But let's be sure and test you next. Doctor? My pleasure. My job. You don't want to frak with me, Bill. Try to remember that. Don't frak with me either, Ellen. lf only they knew that everyone passes these days. Why, it's so much simpler that way. No muss, no fuss. What did her test really say? l'll never tell. (THEME MUSlC)
