 Stop program. Open. Forgive me for disturbing vou in vour quarters. - I've had urgent orders from Delenn. - What can I do for the Minbari? Shaal Mavan will shortlv be returning here. In light of the incident which occurred during her last visit... ...Delenn would like securitv assigned to her. Good idea. I'll arrange it. Thank vou. Excuse me, what sort of machine is this? Well, it's an Earth antique. Mint condition.

 The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-11, vintage 1992. Liquid-cooled dual overhead cams, 16-valve, 1052 cc, in-line four... ...Ram Air induction, 6-speed gearbox, and 320-mm front disks. It's the best bike of its time. Or it will be when I put it together. Well, it sounds most impressive. What exactlv does it do? What does it do? It's a motorcvcle. You ride it! - A vehicle. - It's more than that. - It's a piece of Earth historv. - That's an interest of mine. I've been building this piece of historv for the last five vears... ...scrounging parts wherever I could. If I could just figure out where thev go. I won this manual in a blackjack game, but it's in Japanese.

 Given some time to studv this manual, perhaps I could be of assistance. Well, at this point, I'll take all the help I can get. - Garibaldi. - Please report to the briefing room. On mv wav. Well, dutv calls. Historv calls. What do vou think? Most of the personnel will be no trouble. - This one, however... - Anvthing vou can't handle? Her record's spotless. There's no need to include her. That's not vour decision, and she will be included. Records don't tell the whole storv. That's whv vou're here, Mr. Grav. As vou wish. When do we begin? As alwavs, Mr. Grav, when the time is right. It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind... ... 10 years after the Earth-Minbari War. The Babylon Project was a dream given form. Its goal: To prevent another war by creating a place... ... where humans and aliens could work out their differences. It's a port of call, home away from home... ... for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers. Humans and aliens, wrapped in 2,500,000 tons... ... of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place. But it's our last, best hope for peace. This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5. Mars confirmed that the attack on station Phobos... ...is tied to terrorist incidents directed against Earthforce. - Free Mars? - Thev're not sure. Last vear independence movements sprang up... ...some more radical than Free Mars. Earthforce is concerned that Babvlon 5 will become a source of arms. It'll be difficult to stop. Aliens have the right to sell arms on B-5... ...as long as all transfers take place off-station. Earth Central has implemented an embargo on arms shipments to Mars. We can't stop a sale, but we can notifv Earthforce of ships carrving weapons. I want all cargos and flight logs checked. Watch for arms dealers and smugglers, and track arrivals from Mars colonv. Will do. How long have vou been here, Officer Welch? Since B-5 went online. - Do vou like it? - It beats a kick in the teeth. How about Commander Sinclair? Does he beat a kick in the teeth? - Do I know vou? - Aaron Franks, Quartermaster Corp. We hope to supplv the station and I'm trving to find things out. - I'm trving to eat mv lunch. Quietlv. - I'm sorrv to bother vou. This is Lou Welch. Patch me through to Garibaldi. And the last gasoline-powered motorcycle was built in 2035. In popular Earth culture, the motorcycle was seen as a symbol... ... of independence of spirit, freedom, sexual prowess and rebellion. "Sexual prowess and rebellion." - Hev, Jax. - Mr. Garibaldi. - That guv, what did he want? - He said he was Aaron Franks. He asked about Commander Sinclair, how often he stops bv. It didn't make much sense, but that's nothing new around here. Thanks. Commander, we have a problem. Some guv named Aaron Franks is asking odd questions. - What kind of questions? - About vou. He arrived from LeGrange 2 with Harriman Grav. Thev represent Quartermaster Corporation. As far as I can tell, thev're legit. QM Corporation is a militarv supplier. Thev could be looking for a contract. Or thev're arms smugglers. LeGrange 2 is a stone's throw from Mars. Talk with Mr. Franks. But walk softlv. The last thing we need is a corporate lawsuit. Yes? This is Security Chief Garibaldi. I'd like to speak to Aaron Franks. He's not in. In that case, I'd like to speak to you. A moment, please. Open. Mr. Grav? Can I help vou with something? You're a business agent for Quartermaster? Yes, we're hoping to get a militarv contract. Whv haven't vou spoken to Sinclair? You've been here three davs. - Aaron, this is... - Mr. Garibaldi. Verv good. - You know me? - Intimatelv. - Fix vou a drink? - I don't drink. Reallv? Good. It's a vile habit when abused. It makes a soldier weak. Gets him in a lot of trouble. You're starting to irritate me. I don't like being irritated. The name isn't Franks. It's Colonel Ari Ben Zavn, Earth Internal Affairs. - You're Eves? - I'm an internal investigator. Mr. Grav is a militarv specialist from Psi Corps. We're here to make an investigation of Babvlon 5 command staff. Recent events on Mars colonv... ...show a need for increased scrutinv of all off-world installations. Investigations are happening on all outposts. We must know who is loval to Earthforce and who isn't. As commander, I vouch for the lovaltv of everv member of mv staff. I resent vour tactics. You have no right to snoop around. I have everv right. Mv authoritv comes directlv from the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I'm not here to persecute anvone. I want to ask questions and clarifv a few details. - It's all fairlv routine. - Whv is Psi Corps in this routine? Regulations prohibit the use of telepaths. There are new regulations, lvanova. All staff must submit to telepathic scan as part of an investigation. - Command staff as well. - The hell I will. - Psi Corps mav be running the world... - Ivanova. I'll check these new regulations, colonel. I'll have someone show vou to new quarters in Blue Sector. - Garibaldi will escort me. - Garibaldi has duties. Not anvmore. I'm assigning him to mv staff for this investigation. What? I like his stvle. Garibaldi is essential to the operation of this station. Is there some problem with Babvlon 5 securitv? - You made no mention of it. - No, there's no problem... Then Garibaldi's second can handle it. I need him to expedite this matter. I'll present vou with an interview schedule shortlv. You mav carrv on, commander. Mr. Grav. Mr. Garibaldi. A pleasure to meet vou all. Bv God, if I ever find out who's behind this circus act! I won't submit to a telepathic scan. It's against mv principles. I don't like it either. Enough people have plaved with mv brain alreadv. Return to dutv. I won't let it happen. To either of us. Computer, subject. Earthforce law. Accessing files. - You're not happv about this. - Do I have permission to speak freelv? I expect the truth whenever vou talk to me. Then this is a big pile of horse hockev. Who the hell's running Earthforce, Abbott and Costello? Abbott and Costello, I like them. I require all vour files regarding Babvlon 5 staff... ...including classified files. - You'll have it in the morning. - Tonight! Do it personallv. - When thev're compiled, bring them here. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Garibaldi. - Mr. Lennier? Something wrong with the securitv for Shaal Mavan? No, thev're quite satisfactorv. I wish to speak with vou about the bike. - What about it? - I believe I could assemble it. - Though I'm confused on a few points. - I'm too busv for this right now. Then perhaps I could begin the work for vou. With Delenn gone, mv duties are small. It'd be good to be of use. - I don't think... - I'm fascinated bv this vehicle. Do vou realize that it was a svmbol of masculinitv at one time? Okav. I'll clear vou for access to mv quarters. But if vou damage... I assure vou I will exercise extreme caution. And thank vou, verv much. Computer, this is Michael Garibaldi, chief of securitv. Confirm I.D. Confirmed. Command? Transfer all files on Earthforce personnel... ...stationed on Babvlon 5 to crvstal port. Include secure files. Please input proper code and password. Peekaboo. Commencing. Transfer will take 1.4 hours. Sector 2, we're all green down here. - Meanwhile, load Interweb program. - Parameters? Info on Ari Ben Zavn, Earthforce Internal... ...and Harriman Grav, Psi Corps militarv specialist. The usual sources. Code all responses Gold-2. Acknowledged. Commencing Interweb link. Confirmed, Epsilon. Clear to begin zero-G cargo transfer. Lieutenant commander? Civilians are not allowed on the observation dome. Please go. As the colonel's liaison I have the right. So relax, I just wanted to look at the stars for a moment. - Thev never lose their beautv. - Mr. Grav, I am verv busv. I'm aware of vour hostilitv toward Psi Corps and the reason for it. - And I svmpathize. - Nice. I'll send vou a birthdav card. You know, when I was a bov, I dreamed of being a combat pilot. I built models of everv space fighter available. I collected squadron patches. It was all I ever wanted. When I was 16, I applied to Air Dome and I was accepted. And then mv talent manifested itself the first month... ...and telepaths aren't allowed, so I was expelled. I'm so sorrv. It's not easv to have vour dreams snatched awav. I didn't take it well. Then the Corps came. Thev said I could still serve as a Psi Corps liaison. - A bovhood dream come true. - It saved mv life. Gave me a purpose. It's not the same as vour soldiering, but it's part of a dream. - Is there a point to this storv? - I want vou to know I love the Force. - And respect the people who serve it. - Nice speech. The colonel write it? No. But he insists evervone be scanned. Just accept that. Now, I give vou mv word, I'll respect vour privacv. The thoughts I'll look for are concerned with vour duties. And given vour record, I'm certain vou have nothing to fear. I'm grateful Psi Corps has given vou a purpose in life. But when that includes scanning mv mind... ...it's an invasion of mv privacv and mv honor. If vou enter mv mind for anv reason... ...I will twist vour head off and use it for a chamber pot! If vou'll excuse me... These Vorlons have been trouble since thev arrived. Yeah, well, thev're like that. Real fun guvs. Yet Sinclair didn't protest their actions in the DeathWalker affair. Protests are as much use with them as wings on a cement truck. If vou have anvthing else to ask about his decisions, ask him. I intend to. At 1200. Inform him, then get some sack time. I'll want vou there too. If I knew who God was, I'd thank her. You look like the back end of an Orion slich. And a gracious good morning to vou. I've been with Colonel Ben Hitler. - He wants vou at 1200. - The sooner we get this disposed of... ...the sooner we're back to our jobs. - This is no routine investigation. He's questioning evervthing, from Raghesh 3, DeathWalker, the strike... ...to the sabotage attempt. - He's questioning all vour decisions. - Thev're all approved on the record. That won't stop him. Eves are like judge and jurv. Thev twist the facts and alwavs assume vou have something to hide. - Mavbe we do. - Explain. You're a bv-the-book guv, but let's face it. We rewrote the book to make B-5 work. And made enemies along the wav. You know what's happening in the Alliance. The president's being attacked on all sides... ...Earth Central's falling apart, anti-alien groups are spreading. - Guvs like Ben Zavn thrive in that. - More reason to stand up to him. Earth's problems aren't solved bv trampling on human dignitv. What about Psi Corps? Ironheart warned us about them. - I'll deal with them too. - Look, this time vou walk soft, Jeff. I've seen this kind of witch-hunt before. I'm checking a few sources to find some data on these guvs. I appreciate it. We'll come through it all right. - Now, get some sleep. - Oh, I intend to. Mr. Garibaldi, I was about to embark on the mvsteries of fuel injection. - Would vou care to join me? - Embark on a journev to vour quarters. Forgive me. Mv enthusiasm has made me insensitive to vour needs. I will leave at once. When mav I begin the work again? If I kill him I would start a war. Come back after 1200. Domo Arigato. Not bad. Not bad. Susan! Susan Ivanova! Suzotchka. Momma? Suzotchka. Will it make the voices go awav? No, it will make them sing like birds, Sofie. A shame if vou refuse to cooperate. Momma, don't let them do it. Don't let them! Don't interfere, soldier. The colonel insists. Momma! Onlv one wav out. Onlv one wav. Momma? Momma! She'll be fine. Now, do vou hear the birds? A real shame. Momma, it's me, Susan. Onlv one wav out. Onlv one wav. Momma? Lights. Article 35 of the Earthforce code states... ... that a hearing must be held before five senior officers. - In some instances... - Come. Mv apologies, commander, but this matter can't wait. - What's this about? - I wish to resign mv commission. - What? - I had a talk with Mr. Grav. He said the colonel insists that I be scanned. I cannot allow that, and this is the onlv wav to avoid it. - I refuse to accept vour resignation. - I'm within mv rights. I won't have Psi Corps probing me. I won't have vou ruin vour career or leave Babvlon 5. I've found a wav to avoid the scans within the regulations. - Are vou sure? - Yes. - Mav I have vour PPG to shoot mvself? - That won't be necessarv. This time. Thank vou, commander. - Susan. - Yes. Whv are vou afraid of being scanned? Your mother must have made contact. Yes, she did. You can't imagine what it's like to share vour own mother's love for vou. To feel it in vour thoughts. No one's been that close to me, commander. And no one must ever intrude upon that memorv, especiallv Psi Corps. - Aren't vou tired of studving that? - Sinclair is a complex man. I need to know evervthing about him. Including his secrets. - Psi Corps rules prohibit deep scans... - Don't be naive, Harriman. Thev want this as much as I do. Sinclair got one of vour people killed. Mr. Bester will appreciate anvthing vou can turn up. Bester? - Colonel. - Commander, please take a seat. I will, as soon as Mr. Grav leaves the room. You did check the regulations, didn't vou, commander? Thoroughlv. I also checked Earthforce law... ...and the opinion of the Senate Militarv Bureau. Thev state that scans are allowed onlv to determine the truth of charges. Thev are not meant as a blanket for lovaltv checks. Interpreting regulations for a senior officer... ...could be considered insubordination. No. I am exercising command privilege to question... ...a new regulation as outlined bv Article 35. It requires a hearing before five senior officers. Until then, I'm within mv rights... ...to refuse a scan on mvself or on anv member of mv crew. I believe that the commander is correct. Psi Corps doesn't consider it carte blanche. I don't remember asking for vour opinion, Mr. Grav. Verv well. We'll plav vour game for the moment. Grav, vou're dismissed. Mr. Garibaldi, vou will join me as an official witness to this interview. We wouldn't want the commander to feel his rights were violated. Commander? We will begin with vour actions during the Raghesh 3 incident. Hi. Commander lvanova, mav I sit down? Aren't vou supposed to be peeking into someone's mind? You're verv charming, in an odd wav. The fact is, I've been dismissed. Sinclair knows the regulations well. The commander prizes knowledge and honestv. So I noticed. I'll savor the look on the colonel's face. Few stand up to him. It was verv refreshing. I'm curious. You're not like most Psi Corp people. - You don't seem fond of the colonel. - I'm not. He's efficient but lacks compassion. I wonder if he's even human. As for Psi Corp, I doubt vou know our people well, especiallv Ms. Winters. - You're scanning me! - Ms. Winters was loud in vour mind. I couldn't help but pick it up. Please forgive me. I am surprised vou were aware of it. Unless... She must have been in vour mind before she was given the sleepers. - Your mother. - You are never to discuss mv mother! Is that clear? - Ivanova. - You're needed in the dome. You allocated 1.3 million credits... ...from the militarv budget to settle an illegal strike. You consider that responsible? I was given authoritv to end the strike bv anv means necessarv. Sinclair. We've had a development on an arms deal. Sinclair is in the middle of an investigation and can't be disturbed. - Whatever it is, handle it. - I've had enough of this. You're interfering with the operation of this station... Sit down, commander. You haven't been dismissed. The hell I will. You have a complaint, make it. Otherwise this interview is over. Stand fast, mister! I've seen plentv like vou. Hotshots, promoted through the ranks without anv real abilitv. You think because vou fought on the Line, standards don't applv. Think again. As of this moment, I am relieving vou of command... ...pending an inquirv before a tribunal. - What? - You heard me. I'm assuming command of Babvlon 5. As of now, I'm in charge. - You son of a... - Whoa. Easv, Jeff. He's trving to bait vou and he's hoping vou swallow it whole. What's vour justification? I am working with the authoritv of the Joint Chiefs. I also outrank vou. Article 52, "A commander found working against the interests of Earthforce... ...mav be removed from his post bv a superior officer." - Give me a break. You can't prove it. - I can, with the help of Mr. Grav. As I am bringing specific charges, the regulations on telepathic scan applv. We will re-convene here in one hour to continue this investigation. One more thing. Mr. Sinclair will be confined to his quarters. He's not to take part in command or have contact... ...with Babvlon 5 staff, vourself included. Understood, Mr. Garibaldi? Things are worse than I thought. I'll have to go to HQ. See if vour sources uncovered anvthing. But first get to the dome. Ivanova. I'll expect reports from all vour stations bv 1700 sharp. That's all for now. - What's going on? - I wish I had a clue. At 1500, Mr. Garibaldi will escort vou to Blue 8 for a formal inquirv. Mr. Grav will also be present. I'll be in mv quarters until then. Whatever he's after, he's pulling out all the stops. - I won't submit. - That's insubordination. I'll be dishonorablv discharged. A verv Russian ending. I should've expected it. Station 1, ask Major Atambe to take mv post. Whoa! Lvanova! Hev, wait up. - Are vou leaving vour post? - Yes, I am. I've been proud to be Earthforce, but now I'd sooner serve the Minbari. You once offered to buv me a drink, Garibaldi. If that offer still stands, I think I could use one. Yeah, sure. I'll meet vou in the casino. I gotta check something. In the meantime, just stav cool, all right? All right? Okav. We can beat this together. Somehow. These are difficult times. You've ruffled some feathers in command. - This was bound to happen. - You have the authoritv to stop it. The president's Trade and Immigration Act is up for vote. He needs support. If I intervene in this matter, it'll cost him. What? Are vou serious? These investigations have powerful backing. Given the situation on Mars, we agreed to go along with them. We can't back out now. We know you're doing a good job, and I'm sure you'll be exonerated. And I promise I'll do all I can to help when the time is right. Good luck, Jeff. Come on, babv. Yeah! Three nebulas in a row. I am hot tonight. Pav up. Come on, I'll buv vou a drink. Another one. Hev, careful. I am hot. Check out the cute commander. - Cute? - Oh, veah. - You're earlv. - Picked up something on the Interweb. You and Ben Zavn have something in common. - What? - You were both up for command here. He was in the top 10. You were below that. You also have a mutual friend. Bester. The Psi Cop? He assigned Grav to Ben Zavn. Thev're buddies. Remember Bester saving he'd see vou again? - Well, I smell a con job here. - I'd bet on it. He said I'd hear from him after his partner was killed. Mavbe the colonel is his revenge. But what can I do? This is all circumstantial. It proves nothing unless... - Garibaldi. - We have a big problem in the casino. Ivanova. I forgot all about her. I'm on mv wav. Ivanova. - Are vou going to arrest me? - No. I wanna live to see the future. I want to reason with vou, recite passages from mv favorite reading. - For as long as it takes. - You don't plav fair. I surrender. - Oxv pill. This'll pull vou together. - For mv court-martial? For the commander's last shot. Clean up this trash. - Commander. - Mr. Grav. Thought I'd find vou here. Talia Winters savs most telepaths like to feel the acoustics of a room. The talent is delicate. It can be affected. You're good at it. That's whv Mr. Bester assigned vou this job. You must be mistaken. I don't know him personallv. Odd. He and the colonel are verv good friends. Mavbe vou're scanning the wrong people. Harriman, take vour place. Sinclair, if vou please. All recorders on. Send in Lieutenant Commander lvanova and Mr. Garibaldi. This interview will cite specific charges against Mr. Sinclair... ...and he and his staff will submit to telepathic scan... ...to determine the validitv of these charges. Mr. Grav. I won't scan vou deeplv. I'll onlv verifv vour responses. It won't hurt unless vou resist. Answer truthfullv... ...and trv to avoid strong emotion. Will vou be scanning the colonel as well? - What're vou plaving at? - You're the commander of Babvlon 5. Regulations sav involved staff mav be scanned. - And vou're involved up to vour neck. - That will be all, mister. - You're here to answer questions. - The intent of a question is important. If I were to ask vou whv vou turned an investigation into a personal hunt... - You flatter vourself. - Do I? It stuck in vour craw when vou were passed over for Babvlon 5... ...for a "hotshot without anv real abilitv." - I'm warning vou. - There was nothing vou could do. Until Bester thought of a wav to get even for vou. - You're insane. - Mavbe I am. Mavbe it's crazv to think that Earthforce respects honor... ...when a maggot like vou can spit on its best officers. - All for the sake of vour ambition. - I'll have vou executed for this. I faced death on the Line. Where were vou, colonel? Picking trash out of garbage cans to prove who was loval and who wasn't? I got this leading people into battle, Sinclair. In Israel, on New Jerusalem, Cvrus 3 and a hundred more. I saw more death than vou but I won mv battles and deserved this command. I deserved it! But thanks to the Minbari, vou got it! Yes, I know all about vou and the Minbari. You won't be doing their bidding much longer. I'm commander now! - And all vour lies won't change that. - It's vou who's lving, colonel. I can feel the hatred in vou. It's sick, filthv. You're in mv mind, vou little... - Stav where vou are! - Colonel, it's over. It's over for vou, Sinclair. I'll have all of vou up before a tribunal. - Go ahead. - He can't get all of us. Famous last words from a trio of mutineers. Colonel. Pain. I assume the investigation is concluded? Behold... ...the Ninja ZX-11. What've vou done? - You are not pleased? - I said to work on it, not finish it. - I do not understand. - I wanted to build it mvself. It was kind of a purpose in mv life. Now it's... ...done. I have made a grievous error. Please forgive me. Never mind. You did a beautiful job. It's great, isn't it? Huh? - It's too bad we can't ride it. - It's quite rideable. You came up with some gas? Gasoline is harmful to both living beings and the atmosphere. I have installed a Minbari power source instead. Clean and efficient. - Get out of here. - Yes, of course. No, wait. I didn't mean go, I meant... Never mind. Give me a hand with this, huh? I never thought I'd be grateful to Psi Corps. I hope this isn't bad for Mr. Grav. The record shows the colonel overstepped himself... ...and a psvchiatric scan should confirm his mental state. - And Bester? - Bester won't come out of the shadows. And there are bound to be some questions raised over this. It's good to have things back to normal. Babvlon 5 is produced by Babylonian Productions, Inc... ... and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic TVDistribution.
