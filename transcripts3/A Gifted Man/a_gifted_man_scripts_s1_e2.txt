 Previously on A Gifted Man: - Anna? - Michael? It was fun being married. I was recruited by a clinic, Clinica Sanado. And you didn't call because...? I knew how you were. Brilliant, successful, rich... Clinica Sanando. Anna Paul, please. Dr. Paul passed away two weeks ago.

 Maybe her spirit came to you. I didn't even see the car. I'm a doctor. People put their lives in my hands. I can't be... irrational, like I... Oh. Sorry, Doctor. I thought you were talking to me. Good morning, Rita. Busy morning. Two microdiscectomy referrals, a consult for a trigeminal neuralgia decompression. And I worked in your interview for, uh, This Season NYC's "Top Ten Surgeons in Manhattan."

 Can't we put that off? Revenue shot up 18% after last year's list. Oh, and there's a new reporter. Uh... Liz Martin. Hey. Rita, you work miracles. If that were true, I would have made all of your walks-ins disappear. I don't take walk-ins. Apparently you do today. That or the Puerto Rican Day parade took a wrong left somewhere. You're the doctor, right? Please, my daughter has an earache. I heard you helped a boy at Clinica Sanando. The place your dead ex-wife ran? Excuse me. Push back my first appointment. What? You have patients waiting. With appointments. Stall 'em. I won't be long. Move on in, folks. - There's still some seats inside. - Hey. You're that social worker, right? And you're that really charming doctor. Yeah, don't send me any more patients. Excuse me? I got a reception area full of people who said this place referred 'em. It's not gonna work. No one "referred" anyone. But people h have been talking about what you did for Robert. Saying how nice it was you operated for free. So, now they want your help. Is that such a bad thing? Yeah. It's better when they have insurance. Wow. Seriously, wow. Excuse me. The service for Dr. Anna's inside? - Yes, it starts in a few minutes. - Service? Our clinical director was killed a couple weeks ago, so folks in the community wanted to honor her. Is there anything else I can help you with? Find you a puppy to kick? Uh, I had a... an ulcer, and Dr. Anna cured me. Then she roped me into working the front desk. Somehow made me think it was my idea. Best thing that ever happened to me. All right, uh, Lucy is gonna play one of Anna's favorite songs. Hey, man, how's it going? Uh, today, not so good. I hear that. How did you, uh... how did you know her? Uh... Anna and I go way back. Yeah, meet her once, she kind of sticks with you forever, huh? And you? Uh, same way everyone else does... from here. Yeah, Anna changed my life. I remember one time, she caught me outside smoking. I was expecting some health rap. You know, lung cancer, emphysema, that kind of crap. She said there was nothing compared to the rectal trauma I could expect. Rectal trauma from smoking? 'Cause she was gonna kick my ass if I didn't quit. She grabbed the cigarettes out of my hand, threw 'em into the gutter. There goes 20 bucks, right? Anna did have a way. Taught me a hell of a lot about the patients, too. You're a doctor? Uh, family physician. You know, kids with colds, pregnant ladies. Whatever comes through the door. Oh, man. Oh, I hate these things. Do me a favor. Anna's ghost shows up, don't tell her I went out for a smoke. That was beautiful, Lucy. Thank you. Folks, I'm Philip Romero. I'm president of the board that oversees this clinic, and Professor of Classics at Columbia University. But the role that I am most proud of is Dr. Anna's boyfriend. She was the love of my life. And that is why I am so proud to announce the Anna Paul Scholarship Fund for school-age patients here at Clinica Sanando in honor of the woman who did so much for all of us. And always keep Anna in your hearts. Thank you. Thank you. I hear you helped out last week. Thanks for coming. Sure, yeah. It was a nice service. It was the least we could do for Anna. Philip Romero. Michael Holt. How'd you know her? I'm her ex-husband. You're joking. I'm not sure which one of us should feel weirder. Is there a doctor? We need a doctor! He's a doctor! Patrice fell off the jungle gym and hurt his elbow, and he was crying, and screaming for his mother. Just slow down. What happened? The school nurse gave him something for the pain, and on the way over here, he just passed out in the car. For how long? About five minutes. I tried and tried to wake him up, but I couldn't. Okay, let's get him inside. Sorry. Sync and correction by Mlmlte www.addic7ed.com I met some doctor earlier. - Where is he? - Busy with another patient. It's just you and me. - How you feeling, Patrice? - Better. What happened to me? Well, you had a what we call a vasovagal reaction. Sorry. You fainted from the pain. Ow! Okay. My elbow hurts bad. You're lucky that nice teacher brought you in. She told me - you used to live in Haiti. - In Jacmel. I had a dog and two cats... until my mom died. Is that why you came to America? My dad came and got me. Is he coming to get me now? Teacher tried Dad's cell number, but he didn't answer. Patrice, we need your father's permission to treat your elbow. Do you know where he works? Not really. It's a different place every day. He helps make big buildings. Ow! Easy. Hey. You sure he got this falling off a jungle gym? 'Cause I don't see any scrapes or bruises anywhere. You think it's abuse? Yeah. Dad grabs him, wrenches his elbow. Teacher says she's met him; seems like a sweet guy. But I'll go call the school, see if they have other contact info on Dad. - Thank you. - Hey, okay, how we doing here? Oh. Wait. You're a doc? Michael Holt. The Michael Holt, Anna's ex? She mentioned me? You kidding? Get a couple shots in the girl after work, she wouldn't shut up. Zeke Barnes. Hey. So, who's our friend here? Patrice, ten years old. Says he hurt his elbow in a fall. You're not buying the story. Yeah, no history of trauma, but the elbow's edematous and warm. Looks septic. It's infected all right. - Ow. - Sorry, buddy. I'll treat him with antibiotics. No. Hold on. He just got here from Haiti. He's only been here three months. Could be dengue, could be malaria. You got to figure out what's causing this. And is we should quarantine him. I'll consult Dr. Google. I'll get started on the blood work. How quickly can your lab have it back? Our lab? You mean the one next to the gift shop? You send everything out? And it takes at least a couple days. You got a microscope? Wow. Patrice has sickle cell anemia. Mystery solved. But how has a ten-year-old go undiagnosed till now? He grew up in Haiti. Probably the first doctors he's ever seen. Give him IV antibiotics. I can't treat him without permission. You want him to lose his arm? Let's treat him. Wait, where you going? Back to my practice. Hey, man, I got a whacked-out old lady in Two could use a neuro workup. Nice to meet you, Zeke. Come on, do it for Anna! Jim? I'm confused. Are we supposed to talk about my taxes today? Oh, no, no, this is personal business. You remember my wife Rebecca, right? Uh, yes, of course. Hi. Hi. Everything okay? No. We were out riding our bikes in Riverside Park this morning, and right by the Joan of Arc statue... No, no, it was Grant's Tomb. Wherever it was, and she ran off the path and crashed into the bushes. Told you I didn't want to go. Jim thinks I'm fat. Okay, would you please tell him... you're a doctor... tell him that some women put on weight when they go through menopause? It can happen. There. Okay, but that's not what made you fall off the bike. Tell him. I saw an angel. An angel? We-we were coming around the corner, and there it was just floating right in front of me. You should have heard her scream. I thought I was gonna have a heart attack. This angel-- did it look like anyone you know? Well, maybe "angel" is the wrong word. I don't know. It was, it was a wavy light with twinkling all around the outside. Any headache? No. We can all relax. What you experienced is called an acephalgic migraine. She said she didn't have a headache. It's also called a silent migraine. You have the visual aura but no head pain. You know, I totally forgot. I used to get migraines in college. Just not the aura part of it. Well, your history seals the deal. I'll write you a script for sumatriptan, in case you have any more. Any pain from falling off the bike? Uh, just something up here in my ribs. Hmm. Yeah. Aah! Ay! Ooh! Uh, probably just a bruise, but let's get a CT just to make sure everything's okay. Gowns are in the cabinet. Change into one... not you... and I'll have the nurse take you to Imaging. Thank you. Whew. ...but if you have any more seizures, make sure you let me know right away so I can adjust your carbamazepine. Oh, thank you, Dr. Baxter. All right. Hey. Rita said you might have a patient for me. Your CPA's wife says she was touched by an angel? Nah. I already diagnosed it. Migraine-induced hallucination. Ooh, man, do I know those. Judith gets migraines every month with her period. Stay clear, don't make any eye contact. Bet it was fun when she was pregnant. Yeah. Rebecca's at Radiation. Colette, stop the test! - **** look at your abdomen? - Of course. Uh, I don't understand. That's an ultrasound machine, isn't it? Migraines might not have recurred out of the blue. Could be another reason. Like... that. Oh, my God. What? It's a baby. I'm pregnant? Explains the nausea, migraines, weight gain. And why I didn't want you getting zapped with the X rays. We're pregnant. See, I mean, we tried IVF a couple years ago, but it-it didn't work. We've given up on having a kid. I-I thought I was going through menopause. That's why you didn't know you were pregnant. We're gonna have a baby! Congratulations. Someone certainly has a big grin. I just diagnosed a pregnancy. First time in ten years. Well, take a gander at my face. Notice what I don't have. A big grin? Right. 'Cause my day went into the toilet when you disappeared this morning. What is going on with you, Michael? Nothing. You ran out on me today. You did that MRI on yourself last week. And who's left in the dark like a dummy? Me! Rita, relax. I was at a memorial service for Anna. You were? Not on purpose. Just bring in my next appointment. Shouldn't you wait till your sister's friend finishes fixing your desk? Your focus would improve if you turned this to face the river, but, um, it's beautiful craftsmanship. What are you doing here, Anton? I was building cabinets at this café. It's right across the street. Oh. You're actually a carpenter? Day job. I do the healing on the side. Well, that explains why you were across the street. Now what are you doing in my office? Your sister told me you weren't responding to her texts. She asked me to stop by, see how you were doing. Didn't know shamans make house calls. Normally, we don't, but, um, your sister's worried about you, friend. Well, tell her I'm fine. That little, uh, deal you performed to get rid of Anna's spirit? Yeah, the extraction? Yeah, it worked like a charm. She's gone. Thank you. Hmm. Everything's great. Look, even if I did extract her, which I didn't, sometimes spirits can slip back in, especially if the host has a lot of tears in his energetic body. Wow. Yeah. Okay. She's here... now, isn't she? - Tell him the truth, Michael. - Uh... no... Anton. She's gone. So... So... I guess we're done. Tell Christine I'll call her soon. You still don't believe I'm real. I don't know what to believe. I died, and now I'm back. So, that's it. So, now you're just gonna just pop in whenever? I can't control when and where I show up. This doesn't make any sense. Anton can help you understand me. Where was he 12 years ago? Why did you tell him I was gone? I don't need that guy in my life. I have never heard you tell a lie before. You were always so brutally honest. So tell me the truth. Does being a ghost make me look fat? Very funny. So did you enjoy your memorial? I did. Is that weird? Yeah. I wish everyone wasn't so sad, though. Though I guess I would have been kind of upset if they weren't. They missed you. People loved you. I loved them. Including that, uh, boyfriend of yours. Kind of stiff. I thought what Philip said was sweet. I liked what what's-his-name said... you know, the guy from the front desk. Tavo? Yeah, how you always managed to get everyone to do exactly what you wanted, and somehow made it seem like it was their idea. It's my clinic. Answer it. Uh, uh... I really can't deal with it. Answer it... for me. This is Dr. Holt. Dude, Zeke Barnes. The boy with sickle cell, Patrice... Autumn found his dad. He's on the way in. Wish him good luck for me. Well, his fever spiked. So, draw a blood culture. I did, but, uh, it takes two days. Ugh. To get the results back, yes. Um, listen, Zeke, I-I'd really love to help, but I'm pretty busy. Sorry to bother you. What? You know what. You are always gonna wonder what happened to that little boy. Anna, I'm not you. I... You're not who? You don't have time for them. Uh, sorry, Rita. Uh... uh... Michael Holt, Liz Martin, This Season NYC magazine. - Hi. - Top Ten Surgeons List four years running. I'm impressed. Uh, as am I. Oh, you're being interviewed for a top ten list. I didn't realize what you were doing was so important. Liz, I hate to do this to you, but I've got a patient emergency. Um, so Rita will have to, uh, reschedule. Thanks. Okay? Excuse me. Please, the lady said my son is here. I have to see my son! Sir, just relax and tell me his name. - You're Patrice's father? - Yes. Harold. The lady said Patrice hurt his arm. Where is he? Patrice! Sir, you can't come back here. - Please, sir, sir. - Take it easy. I'm Dr. Barnes. I've been treating your son. What is wrong with him? Patrice has sickle cell anemia, and it's caused a serious infection in his elbow. What? - You didn't know he had the disease? - No. I came here from Haiti five years ago to work. I send back money to him and my wife, Roselo. She was killed last year in the earthquake. It has not been easy, but he's-he's finally stopped crying for his mother. - He is a good boy. - And with treatment, he'll be back on his feet in no time. We've given him antibiotics, and he may need a transfusion. Then I will give him my blood. I have donated before. See? AB negative... that's rare. Please, I want to help my boy! Sir, can you excuse us for a moment? Dad's AB negative? I typed the kid's blood; he's O positive. Then there's no way they're related. Gets worse and worse for this kid. What, what are you not telling me? Uh, just, uh, about the transfusion... You're going to use my blood, right? You can't donate blood. Why not? Patrice is my son. You're not his biological father. Dr. Holt. I'm not? H-He's not my boy? Well, the blood type proves it. It's impossible. Sir, I know this is hard to hear, but Patrice has been asking for you. He's right down the hall here. It can't be true. All these years, a lie. Please, why don't you just come see Patrice? I don't know any Patrice. Sir... sir... What, were you absent the day they taught bedside manner? You just got rid of that kid's only parent. By telling him the truth. Now I have to tell him - that he has to go to County alone? - No. Now you got to tend to that infection. The next six hours are critical. Dude, we can't keep him here overnight. - We close at 9:00. - So send him to an ER. Find me one that's close. The city's shut down six in the last two years. Rita, I know, I'm sorry I ran out on you again. Rebecca's back, says she has the worst headache of her life. Could be preeclampsia. Nurse checked. BP's normal, no protein in her urine. Pregnant women are at risk for blood clots. Prep her for an MRI; I'll get there as fast as I can. Oh, Michael, thank God. It's okay, everything's gonna be fine. Just want to take a picture of your head and see what's causing the pain. This won't hurt the baby, will it? No, MRI has no radiation, so you and the baby will be fine. Okay. Okay? Son of a bitch. It's a brain tumor. Here is your MRI. And there it is... I-I have a brain tumor? I'm sorry. Based on your lymph node biopsy, we know it's a type of tumor called Burkitt's lymphoma. And that-that's bad, right? It's an aggressive cancer. Oh, God. Good news is, it responds very well to chemotherapy. You have to get started on it right away. Y-Y-You mean after the baby is born, right? It's a, it's a boy. Did Jim-- did you tell him? We saw our OB, we're going to have a boy. That's great. We're going to, we're going to name him Tommy after my dad. He passed away last year and, and he always wanted a grandchild. Of course we wouldn't want you to do chemo while you're still carrying the baby. What are you saying? You don't have time to go full-term. We have to induce labor. No, n-no, n-no, n-no, n-n-n-no, it's, it's too early. I'm only 26 weeks, it's, it's... he's too little. Okay, um, a baby tha-that small-- can they live? There's an 80% survival rate. 80%. That's good, 80 is a lot. He's not going to be born with cancer, is he? No, no... but I'm not going to lie. There could be complications. His lungs aren't fully formed, so he's going to need help breathing. He could have cerebral palsy, possibly be blind. No, no, I-I'm not doing that to my son. - Tell him, we're not doing that, tell him. - Okay... Let's-- and what happens if we wait? You can't wait. Honey... No, God, get me out of here. No, we're leaving - Right now! - Becca, will you listen to him? - He knows what he's talking about. - Rebecca, I can save you. No! I have a big problem with Rebecca Marks. Your patient that saw an angel? Yeah. Her migraines were caused by a brain tumor, and she won't let me treat her because she's pregnant. I'd give up everything for my daughter. Yeah, but I can save her, Bax, if she'll just do what I tell her. People make their own choices. Yeah, that's the problem. Heard you took a little field trip this morning. Yeah, just had to nip something in the bud. Anna's memorial service. Yeah... that, yeah. Well, it was nice. Everyone got up, talked about how much they loved her. What'd you say when you got up? Get out of my head, all right? Okay, I'm headed home. Got to tuck my kid into bed. Night. ♪ Honey, are you feeling kind? ♪ The Bronx? You don't have a bed closer than that? Kid's ten years old. Yeah, okay, it'll have to do. Right, right, no, he has sickle cell anemia; he can't take the bus. No, it's, it's not an emergency. Okay, thanks for nothing. Social Services won't send an ambulance? Slammed by budget cuts like all of us. Hey, couldn't stay away, huh? - Place is on my way home. - Whew! For a second there, I thought you were getting sweet on me. - Came to check on Patrice's infection. - He's stable. Antibiotics did the trick, swelling in his elbow is down. - That's good news. - Wish it was all good. Pops never came back. He'll have to go to the County Hospital in a taxi. Aren't you glad you don't have problems like this with your patients? If you want to say good-bye, you'd better hurry. Thank you. Hey, Dr. Zeke says you're feeling better. Kind of. Good, that's great. Where's my dad? I don't know, Patrice. Is he mad at me 'cause I'm sick? No, I'm sure he's not mad at you. Then why isn't he coming back? All right, kiddo, time to go. With my dad? I wish it was. No. I only want to go with my dad. I want... What? His heart was fine. Everything okay? Yeah, does it look like it? I only gave him IV fluid and vanco. That wouldn't cause an arrest. Wait, it's a sine wave. He's hyperkalemic; there's too much potassium in his blood. - You got a crash cart? - Code bag-- it's down the hall. Get me an amp of calcium! Supply closet... it's a blue duffel. Any idea what caused this? School nurse must have given him ibuprofen as a painkiller, pushed him into renal failure. We need a nurse in here. It's a good thing you came back. Come on, Patrice, come on. Got it. Come on, Patrice. Come on. I got a strong pulse. Okay. Going to be okay, buddy. Welcome back, Patrice. Michael, you're back. Uh, yeah. No big deal; I'm just going to make my rounds. Twice in one day? That usually means something's bothering you. Nothing is bothering me, Rita. Oh, not even that clinic you keep going to even though you don't work there? You are way off base. Oh, so I was just imagining it ten minutes ago when a Dr. Zeke called to make sure you knew that the boy you just saved was now stable and in a bed at County. I can't lie to you. But it's cute when you try. You know, Michael, when you hired me, you said first and foremost, my job was to be honest with you when nobody else was. Well, right now that means saying Dr. Michael Holt was not put on this Earth to squander his talents, curing tummy aches at some free clinic. It-It's my ex-wife's clinic. They... they need help and they're short-handed and she is... You know, Michael, I... I used to be a nurse. You did? Well, you. You say that every time I remind you. But if you... if you need help at that clinic... No, no, no, no. It's fine. I'm done with that. - Any fallout from blowing off that reporter? - Oh, yeah, yeah. She was so... impressed with your dedication, she's going to put you at the top of the list. Make sure to reschedule that interview. Oh. It's Jim Marks. Hey, Jim. What's going on? No, no, bring her here. That's good. That's good. Look, she vomited twice, and now this. Her brain tumor must be hemorrhaging. I'll prep the OR. Call Anesthesia and alert OB. Rebecca, I'm gonna take care of you and the baby. Michael, if anything happens during the operation, you save my baby. You promise me. Yeah. No, promise me, if you have to choose, you choose my baby, not me. I promise. Take her to Holt Neuro. There you go. Easy. Easy. Go. Go. Look, M-Michael, before you operate, I've known you for a long time... I know how you make your money, I know how you spend your money... but you don't really know me. Jim, of course I do... - You're the best CPA in town. - No, what I mean is, what's in my heart. I don't know what I would do if she weren't here. You want me to save Rebecca, even if it means losing your baby. She means everything to me. Jim... that's not what Rebecca wants. Michael, if anything happens in there, please save my wife. ****. ****, ****. Oh, Dr. Tattersall called... she said she got pulled into a placental abruption, but she'll be here. You ready to go? Remember your promise. You're gonna be fine. I'm gonna get scrubbed up. She's under and looking good. Marking the bone plate for drilling. She's ready. Drill with an acorn bit. Flap elevator. Skull fragment comes off. Now let's e where the tumor is. Okay, suction. Forceps. 40 cc's out. How you doing? I've got a visual of the tumor, but there's blood everywhere. Got to find the source. What's that beeping? Baby monitor. Fetal decelerations. Where the hell's the OB? Where the hell's the OB? I'll call. Baby's heart rate's trending down. Heart rate's at 50. Baby needs to come out now. - Where's the OB? - Dr. Tattersall just got out of her surgery. She'll be here in five minutes. That's about four-and-a-half too late, and I don't have an extra set of hands... if I stop, Rebecca'll be brain-dead. And if you don't, so will the baby. Fetal heart rate is still dropping. You got to make a choice. Mom or the baby? Michael. Found the bleeder. Clamp. Heart rate's down to 30. We're losing the baby. Victor, get over here. Hold this down right here, gently. Chlorhexidine. Scalpel. I'm through the peritoneum. Incising the uterus. Mom's BP is dropping. Her brain's bleeding again. I can see the baby. We're out of time. Yeah. Wait. She's bleeding out. Ready? I need you now. Get him to the NICU. How's Mom doing? Dr. Tattersall, sew her up. - Mom's lost a lot of blood. - Give me two units and an aneurysm clip. Time to plug this leak. Mom's going down. Got it. Her blood pressure is coming back up. Let's get this tumor out now. Free taxes for life. Come on. Another satisfied customer. Ah... Just... doing my job. - And now your day is done? - I like to go out on top. And not look crazy talking to myself. How's the little boy at the Clinica? Oh, Patrice? Uh... Zeke transferred him to County for dialysis. Oh, his dad doesn't have insurance, huh? - Well, his dad isn't with him. - Why? What happened? Blood types don't match... I had to tell the dad that he's not Patrice's father. You had to? What was I supposed to do, lie? I thought you liked my brutal honesty. Under certain circumstances. So that poor little boy's all by himself at County? Anna, don't start. Michael. I am not bringing him here. Bringing him here... that is a great idea. - Anna. - Michael, you always do the right thing for your patients. I've done everything I can for him! Everything you can? You have not even started. If he was my patient, first of all, I would bring him straight here. And I would find his father. I would do anything I had to. But I can't, Michael; I'm dead. I can't even pick up a phone or ask anyone for help. Except me. Harold. What do you want? You know, I was gonna come here and give you a big sentimental speech about how lucky you are to have Patrice as your son, what a great kid he is, and I was gonna tell you about a woman who I operated on yesterday who was willing to give up her life to save her child's, - a child that wasn't even born yet, but I knew - Leave me alone. You wouldn't hear me, so I'm just gonna be honest with you, Harold-- you're an idiot! - What did you just say? - You're punishing the wrong person. Don't take it out on Patrice if you're mad at your wife... tell her. She's dead. Tell her anyway. Just-just... yell it out. Say, "Hey, honey! You really screwed over my life!" You're crazy. Maybe. But I know one thing... that little boy never did anything but love you. ♪ ♪ Well... looks like he's getting stronger. The doctor says he's got to stay here for a while, but... he'll be okay. How's the chemo? Making me a little nauseous. But I'll live. Yes, you will. Thank you, Michael. Got my angel after all. Philip. Must seem strange, Anna's boyfriend dropping by. Don't usually take walk-ins. I saw you save that kid yesterday. You and Zeke helped. Our Clinica board could really use someone who practiced family medicine. Look around you. I got my hands full. Worth a try. But I do know some great docs, so... how about if I find the clinic a new medical director? Keeping the spirit alive. When can I go home? Well, um... things have changed, and... you're gonna go to a different home. Why? Look, we need to talk about your father. I want to go home with him. Why hasn't he come to see me? Doesn't he love me anymore? I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but... your dad... Is right here. Daddy! We're going home, son. I have missed you. Are you okay? I'm okay, Daddy.
