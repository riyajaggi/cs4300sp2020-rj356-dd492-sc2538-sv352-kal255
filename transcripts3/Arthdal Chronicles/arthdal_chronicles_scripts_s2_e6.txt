 Mubaek will be there, too. We'll be fine. Don't worry. Hurry. Blue lips... Is that... ARTHDAL CHRONICLES I do not wish to go. I understand. Wait. What happened... to our people? Most of them died. There are only five survivors, including myself. Why did you try to take me with you? Because you're one of us.

 I wanted you to join us and find yourself a decent young man. Although you might not find them so attractive. I guess I'm the only female Neanthal... that's alive. Yes. But we're not like the Sarams. We're not obligated to do or offer anything. We owe nothing to no one, and we choose our own paths. Your choice is always more important than anyone else's. That is how we live. So you don't need to leave your family because of us. If... If, by any chance, I want to meet you again... When the fox flower blooms... and the first crescent moon shines the night sky... Manteiv... See? I told you she won't come. Rottip, how can you smile? This will be the end of our blue blood. It won't necessarily be the end of us. Aren't you angry at the sarams? How many tigers and bears do you think are angry at us? However, they're dead now, and we're still alive. Mugwang! Mubaek, what are you doing here? Where's Tanya? Tanya was being chased by Yeobi. Chaeeun was trying to save her! Then where's Tanya? I told her to go first, but I think she got caught. Darn it. Then it has to be Yeobi's doing. Have you seen Mugwang? No. What's with the attitude? Show some respect for the leader of the guards. You little prick. Hey. Who's that? -You punks. -I mean, sir. Who are you? -I'm here to meet the union leader. -What? Is he your father or something? You think you can meet him so easily? Tell Tagon Niruha that his son is here! Tell him that Saya is here! What a psycho. Arrest him. How dare you talk nonsense. Niruha. You tailed me, didn't you? Where's Tanya? If you don't know where Tanya is, give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you. If anything happens to Tanya, I will not forgive you. -What son? What are you talking about? -You didn't know either? I thought he was some kind of a fool. But he's inside talking to Tagon Niruha. He can't be Asa Mot's son. Then is he Taealha's? He's too old to be her son. His son really came here? Did you really not know anything? He obviously has no clue. He doesn't seem startled, so he must have known. You knew? Seriously? You can at least nod your head! Hey, look at me in the eyes. Look at me. Mugwang! What happened? -Is Tagon Niruha inside? -Don't get startled. He's inside with his son right now. -What? -I know, right? He's here? Move. That means he knew. It seems like Gitoha was the only one who didn't know. He obviously knew. Gitoha, what do you know? All the Daekan soldiers knew. Was... Was I really... the only one? Just me? Don't lie to me! It's a lie! My gosh. Did you catch Tanya? No. The thing is... What do you mean, "no"? Mihol... took Tanya. Why aren't you telling Asa Ron Niruha about Tanya? This is complicated. She's the direct descendant of Asa Sin? Tagon. If you're excited, I'll gladly join you. Do you know a girl named Tanya? Tan... What? Tanya? You and Tagon are both very bad at lying. I can't believe you asked for a Sacred Trial and put yourself at risk because of her. I don't know how you found out, but you'll never be able to find her. She's already here. You don't believe me? Would you if you were in my shoes? Yeobi of the Hae Tribe caught me, and she brought me to the Great Shrine? Asa Ron is Tagon's enemy. Yeobi works for Mihol. Mihol is Taealha's father. Did Taealha betray him? Or does that mean Mihol and Taealha are enemies? I don't understand. If I become the High Priest, will I have power? Yes. Let's stay focused. Eunseom is alive. I need to save him. Great White Wolf, please... Please give me the wisdom of the star. Please give me the answer. I'm sorry. I was so angry that I thought wrong. I found a Daekan soldier's body near Tanya's hiding place. That means it wasn't a Daekan soldier that took her. It must've been Asa Ron. That means... Asa Ron knows everything. He could kill Tanya at any moment. We must attack the Great Shrine. I remember Taealha telling me that you're cool-headed and smart. I'm usually like that. But right now, we're in a serious situation. "Serious"? Is it because I tricked you? Or is it because you like Tanya? We have no time for this. If Asa Ron kills Tanya-- You're not going to forgive me? You'll have to forgive whatever you go through if you have no power. You have no idea how much I had to forgive until I gained enough power. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Why should I? Because it's such a waste. You saw everything that was in my room. I trained myself for you. I read every book in the Pilgyeonggwan and I thought of every possibility that could happen. We'll be useful to you. Both me... and Tanya. Okay. I will remember what you're capable of. But if you fool me behind my back again and ruin my plan by acting like a little kid, I'll show you what it really means to be unforgiving. Okay. I understand what you mean. We're already prepared to attack the Great Shrine. I want you to wait for my order. Asa Sin's direct descendant? Have you gone mad? How could you trust that dujeumsaeng and ask for a Sacred Trial? But fortunately, Asa Ron doesn't know about her. We still have time. Asa Ron doesn't know yet? We can win. Tagon will make a move. He can't do that anymore because we took her from him. Why did you... choose Sanung instead of Asa Ron? When we came to Arthdal, we melted rocks and turned them into bronze. People of Arthdal thought of that as a psychic and sacred ability. That's why Asa Ron feared us, hated us, and kept his distance from us. We were a threat to his sacredness. So why would Asa Ron choose to hold hands with you? It's only because of Tagon. What do you think will happen to us if we get rid of Tagon? It doesn't matter. We must stay alive. We have a mission to accomplish. We must take revenge on those who destroyed Remus-- I'm so sick of that mission. You really need to stop. They won't ever show up. More importantly, Tagon... cannot win this fight. Asa Sin's star bell. What if Tanya can find that? The totem that Asa Sin hid in the Great Shrine 200 years ago. Whoever finds that star bell will instantly become the High Priest. Are you... Are you saying... she knows where that is? It's the star bell that Saya told me about. Stay outside. Do you know where that star bell is? Just tell him that you know. Just do it. Please. No. But... I might know. How? How can you know? The byeoldaya. I need that. It's something that's been passed down from the Great White Wolf, the progenitor of our tribe. If the Great White Wolf really is Asa Sin, the byeoldaya will tell me the answer. Where is... that byeoldaya? It's at Iark. What should I do? Tagon has it. Don't lie to me. The skies must be on our side. Mubaek brought it from Iark. It has the mark of the White Peak Mountain's Hearts. Yes, that's the one. Of course, it is. That's how I found out that you're Asa Sin's direct descendant. If you don't trust me, make me drink the hallucinogen. Then you'll know the truth. If we find that, Tagon will win. I'd like to meet Tagon. If... that girl's able to find the star bell, I'll do as you say. But if she can't, you must... abandon Tagon immediately. Will you do it? Okay. I will. I wonder if I will... be able to find it. The Daekan Force is ready. Before we go, I want you to pick five of the most nimble Daekan soldiers. They'll be infiltrating the Great Shrine. Even if we attack the Great Shrine, we must rescue Taealha and Tanya first. Can you do that? Of course, Niruha. Niruha, Mihol is outside. I really don't understand. You even have Tanya now. There's really no reason for you to come and see me. Let's say I'm the only one who knows for now. You're the only one who knows? The High Priest doesn't know about this? So are you saying that you are going to be on my side? You're a man who even locked up his own daughter in prison. Things are different compared to back then. I didn't know you had Asa Sin's direct descendant with you. And I didn't know that direct descendant was capable of finding Asa Sin's star bell. Of course, she might fail to find it, and I might end up telling the High Priest about her. But I'm willing to give it a try if I'm able to gain something by standing on your side. What do you want? It's nothing much. I want you to abandon Asa Mot and marry Taealha. And I want the secret of the bronze to stay within the Hae Tribe. What if... I agree to those terms? Give me the byeoldaya. The byeoldaya? Taealha told me that Mubaek brought it home. Why do you need that? Tanya says she can find the star bell if she has the byeoldaya. Right now, you neither have the direct descendant of Asa Sin nor Taealha. So you don't really have another option. Fine. Instead, I want a handwritten geulbal from Taealha. I want Hae Tuak to witness her writing the geulbal, and bring Hae Tuak with you when you come. Then I'll give you the byeoldaya. Tagon... Tanya, hang in there. Please wait for me. Eunseom, will I be able to do it? I must. No, I will. I can do it. I don't want to regret anymore. I don't want to hate myself. I don't want to be amused. I miss you. I want to live. I want to live... and go to you. DOLDAMBUL What the hell? Hey! Are you nuts? -Shit. -Have you lost it? None? There are no jewels? You little bastards. Don't you want any food? Hey! Hey! Are you all planning to die? Damn. Are you all right down there? Are you good? Listen to how sweet he is. He sounds like my mother. I'm starving as it is. Don't make me laugh. How are you? Are you feeling better? No. Not at all. But I'll hang in there. I might be able to get out and see the ocean. I might be able to die there. I don't know your story, but you were dragged all the way here. Hey. I... I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I apologize. Hey. There's something I've always been dying to know. Is it true... that people of the Momo Tribe have fins? I hear you can breathe underwater. Let's see it. Come on. Let's see. Don't. I'm exhausted as it is. I didn't know you had that kind of tone. You have quite a temper. Why wouldn't I when I'm at the brink of death? You shouldn't mess with the Momo Tribe. Unbelievable. We're like brothers here. I feel like I'm actually living. So if Syoreujagin comes down according to plan, he'll poke me with his sword to see if I'm alive or not. So if I end up dying, place me at the very front. You won't die, you idiot. Here. Just drink your water. Right. If I do, though... I really don't want to die. I should at least see the sea one last time. All right. Let's get some more water then. What if they all caught a disease? Are you trying to curse us all? When did it rain last? Four days ago. What are you going to do if he dies? Mubaek wanted him alive! Shut it! Shouldn't you head back to Arthdal? We'll wait until... noon tomorrow. I will change Asa Ron Niruha's mind. What do you mean? At the Sacred Trial, testify that Taealha is White Peak Mountain's Heart. Taealha will also say that you're the White Peak Mountain's Heart. Asa Ron Niruha will ask the god, and one will be claimed as a liar. The god will say... that Taealha is lying. I will make sure that happens. Does Asa Ron really not know about Tanya? I only have one condition. At the tribal meeting, announce that you'll ask Asa Ron Niruha for the gods' guidance regarding... all union business. She's not lying. Asa Ron is clueless about Tanya. How's everything coming along? Good. Taealha will come to her senses again soon, so please don't worry. All right. I hear you captured a slave. Oh, that. She's a maid and is crucial in persuading my daughter. Is that so? My gosh, I was terrified for a second there. I thought he figured it out. Shut your trap. You'll ruin everything. Did you see Taealha write it herself? Yes, Niruha. She told you to trust her as well. So this is... What if she fails to find it? You, me, and Taealha. There's no need... for all of us to crash and burn together, is there? Hearing you say that makes me trust you even more. Will she be able to find the star bell with it? We'll know when she sees it. If this all works out, I hope you forget all the bad blood between us. Sure. Of course. -How did it go? -We have one, but I can't guarantee you anything. All right. You're dismissed. You heard everything, right? Yes. Make your move, then. All right. I asked for water to wash up ages ago! It'll be here soon. How did my life get like this? You. Are you sure you can find it with the Byeoldaya? I asked if you were certain. You want us to fight? Hey, why aren't you answering me? I risked everything by putting my faith in you. If you fail to locate it, I'll be losing the man I love and desire. Can you find it or not? I don't know. I only said that I might be able to find it. What? Say that again. I'm just as clueless! I'll only know when I see it. And you're saying that now? You should have told us that earlier. Are you insane? This is your way of getting back at us, isn't it? Come to think of it, that's not a bad idea. Whatever happens, Tagon is still the person who killed the Wahans. You bitch. Say that again. What did you just say? You filthy dujeumsaeng. How dare you. My lady, you should calm down. Why you... I will bring a fire, so please calm yourself down. I was really worried, but I'm glad you and Taealha are working together again. I should apologize for making you take the hallucinogen twice. That's nothing, sir. It's all right. Right. Good. Asa Ron's room? Why did he bring me here? Did you get it? Yes, Niruha. I finally got it. Mihol! On our way here, I already told you that I was... sorry. Are you betraying Taealha? She is the one... who betrayed me first. GGACHI CAVE Heads, we live. Tails, we die. It's time to test our luck, Tanya. Let me relay Momyeongjin's words. "The direct descendant of the Great Mother Asa Sin... has come... to Arthdal." -What? -Is that true? Where in Arthdal? -What... -In Arthdal? So this is what the Great Mother Asa Sin hid all those years ago. It's the key to finding the star bell. I don't know... if the star bell can be found with it, though. Why not? Are you worried that I might actually find it? Well, it's still not too late to take Tagon's side. No. Tagon can't give me what I want. But you can get it from me? Yes. What is it? The position as union leader. You, Niruha, no longer need to be in that position. If that Tanya locates the star bell, a Sacred Trial won't be needed anymore. You just have to discreetly obtain the star bell and kill the girl. The bloodline of the Asa Clan will no longer be questioned and Tagon won't ever be a match to you. You can drive him out of Arthdal. What if she doesn't know where the star bell is? Then you'll conduct a Sacred Trial. Taealha will testify against Tagon. He will be banished after having his feet cut off which means that his position will be vacant. That's true. And you're asking me to grant you that position? Whatever happens, you win both ways. You will be enjoying the victory, too. Niruha, I wish for nothing else than to protect the people of Hae Tribe and achieve scientific progress. In order to do so-- The position is yours. Niruha, please receive the honor of Isodunyong. Go. Go and find Asa Sin's star bell. Yes, Niruha. It doesn't matter if she finds it or not. Either way, Arthdal will be in my hands. What happened? Did you get it? It's right here. Is that the byeoldaya? I wonder if Tanya's all right. Mubaek's nowhere to be seen, either. Chaeeun, what will happen to the White Peak Mountain's Hearts? I heard that there's a meeting tonight. -Don't attend it for the time being. -Why not? Why would you go without me? It's the White Peak Mountain's Hearts! -What on earth? -How dare you come here? What is that? Those crazy bastards! -My gosh. -They must have lost their minds! Goodness. -Is something up? -Something must be going on. What are you staring at? Arrest them all! -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. The direct descendant of Great Mother Asa Sin is back! The direct descendant of Great Mother Asa Sin is back! The one who carries her sacred blood is at the Great Shrine. The one who carries her sacred blood is at the Great Shrine. The direct descendant of Great Mother Asa Sin is back! The direct descendant -is back! -The direct descendant... The one who carries her sacred blood is at the Great Shrine. The one who carries her sacred blood is at the Great Shrine. Mother, I need your help. Please help me save Eunseom. Find the totem with this symbol and keep it close to your heart. I don't know. What? I'm sorry. I don't know what it means. Yeobi, -bring me the hallucinogen. -Yes, sir. She has no reason to deceive us. So why... Tagon destroyed her hometown. She lost her home overnight and saw her people get brutally slaughtered. She might have concocted a plan to get back at him. Drink. Drink it. It's working. All right, then. What's your name? I... am Tanya of the Wahan Tribe. All right. Good. Asa Sin's star bell... Where is it? I don't know. I don't know where it is. I'll ask one last time. Do you... really not know... where it is? I really don't know where it is. Then it's been decided. It's now your turn to keep your promise. I kept my end of the bargain, but she doesn't know where it is. What now? Do you really not know where it is? Don't you know? You really don't know? I don't know... where it is. All right. It's all over, then. I'll do as you say. At the Sacred Trial, you will testify about Tagon's crimes. I will. Sit. The only issue now is Tagon. We just need him at the Sacred Trial. Here's what you'll write. "Tanya will find Asa Sin's star bell. So... make sure to attend the Sacred Trial. It's our chance to end Asa Ron." Then what about Tagon? Finally, he'll have both his feet cut off. Is the direct descendant of Great Mother Asa Sin at The Great Shrine? Please answer us. Please answer us. Asa Ron Niruha, please answer us. -Please answer us. -Please answer us. Is the direct descendant of Great Mother Asa Sin at The Great Shrine? Please answer us. -Please answer us. -Stay back! -Please answer us. -Please answer us! -Please answer us. -Please answer us. The direct descendant of Asa Sin? Yes, that's what they're asking. The White Peak Mountain's Hearts that were in hiding have all resurfaced? Why isn't Mihol back with more news? -Please answer us. -Please answer us! -Please answer us. -Please answer us! -Please answer us. -Please answer us! -Please answer us. -Please answer us. The direct descendant of Asa Sin! -Please answer us. -Please answer us. -Please answer us. -Please answer us. The direct descendant of Asa Sin! -Please answer us. -Please answer us. Tanya, please still be alive. Asa Sin, she carries your blood, so please protect Tanya. Please! The White Peak Mountain's Hearts are swarming outside the Great Shine claiming that the direct descendant of Asa Sin is here. We can't quietly get rid of that girl anymore! It's not just them. People of the union are also here. Niruha. You are being protected by the eight gods. This could work to your advantage. What? How so? You may not obtain the star bell, but you will banish Tagon and sweep the White Peak Mountain's Hearts. They've voluntarily come out of hiding. Does the girl not know where the star bell is? I'm afraid not. Yes, of course. The sun, the moon, and the star. About 100 years ago, these were carved on the Great Shrine's ceiling. However, new symbols were etched and placed upon them. Is that so? So even if this is a map, it won't be of any use. Could it be somewhere up on the ceiling, then? Niruha, once the Sacred Trial is over, find it and take it for yourself. Address the union and inform them of the Sacred Trial. -Please answer us. -Please answer us! -Please answer us. -Please answer us! -Please answer us. -Please answer us! Tomorrow, when the sun is above the Union Palace, the Sacred Trial of Taealha will commence. Is the direct descendant of Asa Sin at The Great Shrine? -Tell us! -Tell us! -Please tell us! -Please tell us! Yes, there's someone claiming to be Asa Sin's direct descendant. It's Tanya of Wahan Tribe. If she finds Asa Sin's star bell during the Sacred Trial, the old prophecy will come true. Are you sure? Yes. The guard outside the room heard Taealha shouting it. The girl doesn't know. -Then-- -All right. You're dismissed. Yes, Niruha. Does that mean there's no other way now? Mihol is here with his guard. Tanya doesn't know where the star bell is. He obviously didn't come here to tell us about it. This must be a trap. If you want to start a coup, you'll have to deal with Mihol first. Niruha, the entire Daekan Forces are ready to strike. Our warriors are lying in ambush in the forest and all over the square. The entire Daekan Forces, including Mubaek, will faithfully obey your orders, Niruha. So this is what's happening in the end? This is the result? I tried so hard to prevent bloodshed in the Union. I did everything I could. -Father. -When I spill my drink, kill... Mihol's guard. Yes, Niruha. You may come in. I come bearing good news, Niruha. Asa Ron is finished now. Tanya said she knows where Asa Sin's star bell is. Did she? This is clearly a trap. So the gods are abandoning Asa Ron, after all. Yes, Niruha. This is Taealha's letter to you. Tanya knows where the sacred object is. Put your worries to rest and just trust my father. We won! I miss you, Tagon. I'd be elated if I could see you again. Taealha... Yes, that's the kind of person you are. I delivered the news to you with a delighted heart. Then I will see you tomorrow at the Sacred Trial, Niruha. Yes. I'll see you then. Niruha, why... Why did you let him go? Niruha, we mustn't let this opportunity slide. Give orders to-- Here is my order. All Daekan warriors... should wait at their current positions. Yes, Niruha. -The Great Mother, Asa Sin! -Our Great Mother! -Isodunyong! -Return her to us! Return our Great Mother to us! -Asa Sin's direct descendant! -Return her to us! Asa Sin's direct descendant! -Return her to us. -Return her to us. -Our Great Mother! -Asa Sin's direct descendant. -Return her to us. -Return her to us. Return our Great Mother, Asa Sin's direct descendant, to us. -Return her to us. -Return her to us. Mother... -Our Great Mother. -Return Asa Sin's direct descendant... Eunseom. Eunseom. Hey, Dung Bug. Hey! Hang in there, okay? You can get out of here tomorrow. You have to see the cold sea before you die. Yes, you're right. I wanted to show all of you what the sea looks like. I'm sorry. What are you talking about? We'll get out of here together. "Together"? It's such a nice word. Keep it together, Dung Bug. My name is not Dung Bug. I'm... Sateunik. When you... get out of here... and climb over the Hasi Mountain, you'll get to a place... called Jubinol on the hillside. My wife... is probably still waiting for me there. Take this... to her. Tell her that she can leave that place now. And tell her... that I died as Sateunik of the Momo Tribe. Okay, we will. My wife... will return the favor. She also belongs to the Momo Tribe. I, Olmadae of the White Mountain Tribe. I, Badoru of the Kaeran Tribe. I, Chanaragi of the Mulgil Tribe. I, Ipsaeng of the Ago Tribe. I, Eunseom of the Wahan Tribe. We promise you, Sateunik of the Momo Tribe. I will never let go of another hand. Everyone here will hold hands together. Together, we will deliver the news to Sateunik's wife on his behalf... and go see his ocean. -You rat. Move it! -Go! Nothing came up, even today? Nothing came up, sir. I'm certain that another plague has broken out. God damn it, these rats... What should we do? Not me. I can't go down there. I know that, you prick. -All right. -Remove the log! Now send it down! Syoreujagin is going down. Careful with it! Harder! Shit, these rats... Damn it! Are they really all dead? How many jewels would this cost me? Hey! Send it down. What's going on? What are you guys doing? Syoreujagin went down, but a plague must have broken out. What? A plague? See? I told you. Damn it. -God damn it. -I can't believe it. Are you enjoying yourselves? All of you, get back to work! -Get back to work! -Move it! Do your work! God damn it. Jeez. Shit. Get off me! You son of a bitch. It's good to see you. Good to see you indeed. I thought I'd never see you again. You crazy bastards. Listen. Do you actually think you can get out of here by doing this? If we can kill you, that will make us happy enough. If you help us get out of here, we'll give you all of this. What the hell are you talking about? Who says you can do that? We were going to hold him hostage and escape this place. Now, I know that both we and this bastard are like worthless vermin here on the Great Black Cliff. And there's no point in holding him hostage. They'll kill him first. Then what? How are we going to escape this place? All of us are dead. We'll be able to get out of here if we play dead. And if this prick helps us. So what? Are you saying we'll give him all of my jewels? Got another idea? Damn it... Fine. But... I'll kill you if we can't escape. What do you say? Do you want these jewels? Or shall we just die together? You see, I liked you from the get-go, Purple. Let's do it. -Miruhisha. -Miruhisha. -Miruhisha. -Miruhisha. There they come! The descendant of Asa Sin! Let curses come upon the one who blasphemed against our gods! -The descendant of Asa Sin! -The descendant of Asa Sin! -Blasphemy must be punished! -Punish Taealha! -The descendant of Asa Sin! -Let curses come upon Taealha! Punish her! -Let curses come upon... -Send it down! All right. Pull it up! How can we trust this sly jerk, though? I'm putting my life on the line as well. That sly swine won't betray us because he wants the jewels so much. Pull it up! -What are you doing? -We need to be able to see. I see. You're very clever. Lie down. Pull it up! The swamp by the mine where dead bodies are discarded. Just take us there. -Niruha. -Niruha. Haramahamen! Haramahamen. Haramahamen. -Haramahamen. -Haramahamen. Just now, -Asa Ron Niruha entered the shrine. -Asa Ron Niruha entered the shrine. The Sacred Trial is beginning. The trial is beginning! -Punish blasphemy! -Asa Ron Niruha! -Yes! -The direct descendant of Asa Sin! Arthdal... I can go to Arthdal with all these jewels. Pull it up! Can we trust this jerk? My precious jewels... If he tries anything funny, we'll all get up and shout. Tell them there are jewels hanging from his foot, which he's trying to steal. If I can't get my hands on those jewels, I'm going to kill you all. The head of the Hae Tribe, Taealha, who is also the Minister of bang of Bronze Affiliation, one of the eight governing agencies of the Union. You instigated your servants to question the sacredness of the Asa clan and spread false, blasphemous rumors throughout the Union. That is why you are here today, in front of Isodunyong, the god who never sleeps, and other gods of Arthdal. Correct? It is true that I committed such an act without thinking whether it's right or wrong to spread the rumors. However, since everyone has heard the rumors, the one who spread them first should give us answers. And who is that? The leader of the Union, Tagon Niruha. -What? -Tagon? -My gosh. -Tagon Niruha? Tagon Niruha, answer to the gods' summons. I, Tagon, a child of the Saenyeok Tribe of the Black Land and the leader of the Union, answer to the name of Isodunyong and to the powers of Airuju. Tagon Niruha, you are here to respond to the allegations about instigating White Peak Mountain's Hearts and Taealha to spread false rumors as well as blaspheming and standing up against the gods' powers. Am I correct? I saw a tribe from Iark speaking our language. Also, Mubaek of the Mulgil Tribe saw Kanmoreu as well as Asa Sin's byeoldaya. Hence, I never spread any false rumors. I was only delivering the gods' will. "The gods' will"? What might that be? "The Great Mother Asa Sin's direct descendant came to Arthdal. Protect and worship her." He took the bait. What a shame. He is putting his life on the line for that wench. The prophecy said, "Our Great Mother Asa Sin's descendant will return. The gods will recognize the one who finds Asa Sin's star bell." And the next line goes like this. "Those who insult the gods will have their feet cut off, and they will have to crawl on all fours." If this woman isn't Asa Sin's direct descendant, you basically insulted our gods by making such a false claim. Do you realize that, Niruha? Ishillobu seguma. ISHILLOBU SEGUMA: IT IS GOD'S WILL AND CANNOT BE HELPED So this woman is a direct descendant of our Great Mother. Is that what you're saying? That's correct. I, Asa Ron, the head of the White Mountain Tribe, who is also the High Priest of the Union will determine whether or not this woman is truly of the sacred bloodline in front of all people of Arthdal, the Union founded by Aramun Haesulla and protected by the eight gods. -Yes! -Haramahamen! -Haramahamen! -Haramahamen! -Haramahamen! -Haramahamen! -Haramahamen! -Haramahamen! If she finds the star bell in the Great Shrine, she is a true heir. If she fails, she'll be banished on all fours with the blasphemous one. -The direct descendant of Asa Sin! -The direct descendant of Asa Sin! The woman who claims to be a direct descendant of our Great Mother. Our Great Mother's star bell is somewhere in this shrine. Find it and prove yourself. Here, try. Father, why did you let him go? According to Taealha's letter, Tanya... knows. Don't trust Father. Just say you don't know. Bite your lips if you know. I really don't know where it is. She knows? She knows where it is? When I gave her the hallucinogen, she said she didn't know. What is going on? What do you think is going on? I really don't know where the star bell is. Even at this very moment, I have no clue. I've never even seen this place before. But... Is there some sort of fire in that place? Yes, the kind of fire that can't be put out. The shrine was built there because of it. This is fire. And there are three feet here. Three steps away from the fire. Three steps away from the fire. Your stride width is too wide. That was too narrow. The Spirit Dance must look the same every time, even if you do it 100 times. Great White Wolf, did you really foresee this far? Did all those years in the past exist for this moment? Will I find the answer when this dance stops? Lift your chin up. Your left eye should be in line with your left shoulder. Gosh, I'm exhausted. Must I practice this hard? Will the Spirit not come if I don't practice this hard? I'm not sure. I'm just teaching you the knowledge that's been passed down from mothers to mothers. Could it be there? Is it there? If not... It's bleeding! -Did it die? -What just happened? -What is that? -What's going on? The shell! "The one who breaks the shell shall appear... with the Azure Comet along with death." "The one who breaks the shell." This was what it meant. No, we must stop her. But it's way too high. How can I... My gosh... Why must I learn to fling stones with a sling? I'll be the Great Mother of our tribe. I'm not sure. This is just how it's always been done. All other Great Mothers had to learn this too. -Asa Sin! -Our Great Mother, Asa Sin! -Asa Sin! -She is Asa Sin's direct descendant! -Asa Sin! -Asa Sin! -It was true! -Our Great Mother, Asa Sin! -She really is a direct descendant! -Asa Sin! -Asa Sin! -Asa Sin! Tanya. -Asa Sin! -Asa Sin! Eunseom. -I'm coming for you. -I'm coming for you. Subtitle translation by Ja-won Lee ARTHDAL CHRONICLES What is the land you'll stand on? The hearts. -The hearts of the people. -Run! It's a coup. Tonight, Arthdal will be remembered for a long time. We will repay his kindness! We will repay his kindness! Their limbs will be ripped to pieces and thrown away separately. Who's the crazy bastard? Goodbye. I, Eunseom of Wahan Tribe, promise... to take you all in. Ripped and synced by gabbyu's Subs
