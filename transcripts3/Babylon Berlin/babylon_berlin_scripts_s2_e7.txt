 Let's bring some original Prussian spirit to this matter. The President of the Reich has ordered that the train be sent back to the Soviet Union immediately. Without delay. Without further investigation. - Fritz! - Gretchen. - Let me go. - We were ratted out. - Freeze. - Gretchen, run! Run! Fritz! No! They shot him! Your Benda here. The guys who shot down Fritz, they were his men. Tell me what to do, and I'll do it. Do you have to go? Not yet.

 Our hotel affair is beginning to feel as secret as it was at home. We have to get a flat. Is that the boy already? Impossible, he's taking the circle line. Charlotte! Where did you come from all of a sudden? - Has the train left Berlin? - What? It's going back to the Soviet Union. - Where have you been? - When exactly is it going back? Wait downstairs. I'll be down in five. Who was that? A colleague. It's urgent. I have to take care of it. Have the children packed yet? Greta? - Have the children packed yet? - I packed. You're to speak when you are asked and not interrupt Miss Greta. Jakob has packed and I'll help Margot after lunch. That's how we'll do it. When is your train? In two hours, from Stettiner Station. I'll take you there and go to the office afterwards. Why are you crying? I'll be right back. Greta? Come on. You're such a good girl. And pretty. There you go. We'll keep our chin up. - I'll go finish the packing. - Good. You do that. Charlotte? I've been looking for you everywhere. I read Jänicke's notes. You were right. His target was Wolter. - Where have you been all this time? - I'll tell you later. Come on, we have to go straight away. -But where? - To see Benda. - On a Sunday? - Yes. Get in. Wolter meets State Secretary Wendt and Alfred Nyssen, accompanied by a woman whom Nyssen introduces as the Countess Sorokina. - Svetlana Sorokina. - Yes, exactly. Listen closely. They are talking about robbing the train while it is being sent back to Russia, and it says here where exactly. Here. Milestone 127. But why would Wolter want 20 tons of poison gas? This is not about gas. It's about a hidden freight in one of the wagons. The Sorokins' gold? How do you know about the gold? Sorokina talked about it. You met Svetlana Sorokina? Yes, but I... I didn't take it seriously. About the gold. Yes. Sorokina swapped the wagon numbers. AB 3221 was the wagon which was opened in the engine shed, and TY 2305 is the wagon which now contains the gold. And they'll all try to stop the train before the border. Who do you mean, all? Well, Wolter. And Nyssen. - Shall I pack Marie's evening dress? - You don't need to. We'll be in the garden the whole time. When Mama does her exercises, with Dr. Hutten. Are you getting ill? With Mama alone it's so boring. I don't want to go without you. Please, children. Why did you cry earlier? Because I was sad. Because... I won't see you for so long. Then little Marie will stay with you. Thank you. - Charlotte. - Greta. What are you doing here? - This is Inspector... - Gereon Rath. - Is the Councillor in? - Come in. - What's the matter? - I'm sorry, but it's very important. Come on in, I don't have much time. Miss Overbeck, please offer the lady a drink, thank you. What would you like? - I can make some tea... - Nothing, thanks. I need an experienced task force, about 12 men. It's too late for that, Inspector. - But if we catch Wolter in the act... - Do you really think we'll mess with anybody because of that damned train again? Wolter is small fry. We'll catch him sooner or later... He killed Stefan Jänicke. Can you prove that? Not yet. But we both know he did it. Lotte? Lotte? Can we meet? I need to talk to someone. Your guy? - No... - Oh. Tell the bastard to go to hell. Greta, no guy in the world is worth it. I'm sure Mr. Gennat will take all the necessary steps should your suspicion be confirmed. And please let that damned train go. Please excuse me now, I have to take care of my family. With all respect, you can't be serious. You put Jänicke on Wolter's tail. You put this boy at an extremely high risk and now you don't even want to try... This is not your responsibility, Inspector! This is possibly about a whole wagon full of gold. We need to clean up this mess. We gambled and lost. In a few weeks, none of us will likely be sitting in our chairs. We'll deal with Wolter and his gang in due time. And if someone wants to steal precious metals, it's none of our business. Councillor, I beg you. - With just a dozen men we could... - You still don't get it. Today, State Secretary Wendt will release the train on behalf of the President. At exactly 3 p.m. Please excuse me. What will we do now? Milestone 127. We need to find it. Here. We need to go... towards Wünsdorf. And then to that lake, and all along the water. Milestone 127 must be around here. Alright. Let's go now. Very well. Hello? It's me. They're gone now. You can come. CONFISCATED! KEEP DISTANCE! - Is everything ready? - Yes. Listen, Henning. Take the fastest car you can get and take the same route. Milestone 127. Full gear, yes. Security level four. With all the frills. Yes, dammit, gas masks, too. Hurry up. They're on their way. Good. So, where? - The study. Where is the study? - This way. There. Here, hold this. - Otto, I don't know... - It's too late for that now. - This won't get Fritz back to life. - Be quiet and hold this. - I'm scared. - Careful now. Otto. The other way round. Right. Check my jacket, right-hand side pocket. Who signed this? URGENTLY WANTED FOR INCITEMENT OF THE PEOPLE AND DEFAMATION - Benda. - Well then. This here is the ignition mechanism. You'll prime it later. Here, you'll twist these wires together and put them back in the hole. But only shortly before the old guy comes back, yeah? Don't wait too long. When he opens the drawer, the bomb will explode. - You have to be gone then. Got it? - Yes. You better disappear altogether. Get out of the city. Here. We're doing this for Fritz. Can I call you? We'll call you. - Operator. - Please give me police headquarters. One moment, please. Police headquarters, how may I help you? Excuse me, I'm trying to reach a female inspector, assistant Ritter. - Which department? - Homicide department. Homicide squad. - Department A, homicid e. - Yes. - One moment, please. - I'll hold. There is no deputy inspector of that name here. - Are you sure? - Yes. I can't help you. OK. Thank you. Charlotte. Where have you been? If there is a time where you have to tell me everything, it is now. What does he want? Gereon! Gereon, wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! I'm stuck. IN ETERNAL MEMORY OF OUR WORLD WAR VICTIMS The brave men we've come here to honor today... were ready to give something... no one can ever give them back. Their youth... their future... their lives. They gave it to us. To our German Fatherland. - Who is that man? - Pardon? From the trust. They supported us when Dad didn't come home. They want to pay for your studies. I don't want to study. I thank you. I would now like to ask Mrs. Helga Rath from Cologne, the widow of infantry lieutenant Anno Rath, to come forward. Leave me out this time, OK? I thank the Annemarie Nyssen Trust for this invitation. Thank you for the opportunity to speak here. I came to Berlin with my son, Moritz. Moritz who never got to meet his father. When I learned of the loss of my husband, Moritz hadn't been born yet. My husband was deemed missing at the time when... when our early happiness as a twosome was supposed to become "us". Us three. Loss, loneliness... gloom. Excuse me. I always say that I'm grateful. But today I see for the first time... a member of the Nyssen family in person. Your company, Nyssen AG, is the biggest arms manufacturer of the German Reich. Someone who is responsible for producing the weapons used to kill our husbands... can't then give us any solace for the losses we have sustained. Mr. Nyssen, you and your family, I'm grateful for your help. But I also despise what you do. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Mrs. Rath. How about I invite you for lunch afterwards and we talk in peace? Good evening, Miss Overbeck. Going out? I wanted to go get some beer... before you come back. - Is there no beer left in the basement? - There is. Yes, there is. I thought it wasn't cold enough. You're all confused. Don't worry, we'll do it differently tonight. I'll take care of the drinks, you prepare dinner and keep me company. Are you ready, Miss Overbeck? A '15 Petrus. You've never had anything like it. We investigate the suppliers of the city hospital. Sold off to those Sklarek Brothers four years ago, approved by Lord Mayor Böß. So far, so good. But... a company which deals with hospital textiles can hardly invoice for fur coats, right? Who needs mink coats in hospital? Or at the police station? Miss Overbeck, I paid one sixth of my monthly salary for this wine. And then there's the wife of the Lord Mayor. Anna Böß. You must be suffering terribly. That guy should be ashamed. Such a lovely girl like you. Will you still need me, Councillor? No. Oh, Greta? Councillor? Give me the lad's name, I'll have him arrested and thrown in jail for meanness. Get out of the car, we're home. Greta? What a surprise! - Did something happen? - Jakob has a temperature. Where is the girl? I gave her the evening off. Heartache. When it rains, it pours. I'll take the children to bed. Mum will make some tea for you, so you'll sleep well. No, Mum, I'll go straight to bed. - A ticket to Usedom Island, please. - Return? - Single. - Eight fifty. It's this platform here. That's the one. Bribery! Extrablatt! - Sorry, I was too hasty. - Mayor's wife gets mink coat paid for by the city! Extrablatt! Bribery in hospital supplies. Sklarek Brothers are suspects. Extrablatt! Bribery! Scandal! Böß, you pig, your wife's got what? Fur and mink on her Jewish bod! Böß, you pig, your wife's got what? Of course I'll go out there. Jewish sow! Böß, you pig, your wife's got what? Daddy? Can I be with you, Daddy? I can't sleep. Where is your mum? She's with Jakob. Come here, then. Do you want to help me work? Look here, then. So, please sign... here. Gentlemen! Please be reasonable. I... I give you my word. This is no way to talk to each other. This is no way to solve problems. This is... This is no way to deal with one another. I will have this station cleared! How dare you talk to me like this! -I won't stand for this! Fritz! What? What are you doing here? Fritz... - Fritz, what are you doing here? - You're mistaking me for someone else. Tell me, what are you doing here, Fritz? You're mistaken. Fritz, what are you doing here? Police, let's go! Quickly! Back up! Get back! STETTINER STATION Right. My darling, we've done enough work. Now it's time to go to bed. Daddy? What's this? What, my little angel? August?
