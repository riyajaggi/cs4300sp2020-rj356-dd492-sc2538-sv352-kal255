 Previously on Babylon Berlin. You owe me a report for the first of May. I'm working on it. They only ever made one copy of each of König's films. You know I guaranteed that we would solve this problem before the elections. Bruno? I need your help. I have to find Krajewski. He's the key. If you need anything... Look, this is what I have for you when you sing. I need something stronger.

 I thought it was just the thing for you shaking chickens. Also, Kardakov was still there last night. - Where, in Berlin? - In Sorokina's flat. They killed them all because of you. They are all dead! At Wormsstrasse. There's some kind of basement. It's the headquarter of the Red Fortress. Let the train pass. According to our... It runs by order of the Reichswehr. Someone needs to sign off the freight papers. That is Major General Seegers. One of the wagons contains a different freight. We can't examine them here.

 There must be somewhere where they can be opened. You have the necessary staff? Were you at the front line? I've seen this a thousand times. Looks much like a gas attack. Gas! Did the paper get wet? Please iron it. CHEMICAL ACCIDENT AT ANHALTER FREIGHT YEARD - Greta, the coffee, please. - Right away, Mrs. Benda. Thank you. Yes, thank you. No. Here. Greta, and the eggs... go there. And five minutes, please. Mr. Councillor? Madam? Yes? I wanted to say thank you for employing me. Yes, no problem. And the children? I'll go right away. We shouldn't be waiting for them, but the other way around. Greta? The door, please. Good morning. Schwarz is my name, from pathology. I urgently need to talk to the councillor. - Do come in. - Thank you. Today I speak about the phenomenon of war neuroses. In common parlance also known as 'shell shock' or 'bombshell disease.' External characteristics are an extensive loss of physical control, muscle spasms in all extremities. Uncontrollable convulsions in the head and face area. The symptoms of those former front line soldiers, who have the gruesome fate of their generation written into their bodies, are witness of the most disturbing experiences in the field. The body punishes the soul for all the impositions of the war by rebelling. Experts also insinuate that the majority of those cases are simulators or cowards who use some sort of medical fringe phenomenon to evade their responsibility to society, though we must object to that vehemently. My studies from the past seven years show that those affected actually suffer with a mental disorder. Let me give you a concrete example. Private Krajewski, 32 years of age on arrival. PRIVATE KRAJEWSKI. AGE 32 YEARS BURIED UNDER GRENADE SHOWER At my institute, we use a new three-step procedure I have developed. The first step is sedation of the patient with barbituric acid derivative, and put into a hypnotic state by means of suggestion. Hypnosis! In hypnosis, we take the patient back... to the source of his trauma. To the horrors of war. The images of his memory go as deep as what we call the subconscious. We? Who is 'we'? Is there an above-conscious, too? In the second step of the treatment we conduct projective tests according to the method of Professor Rohrschach... - Rohrschach? Poppycock. - Yes. With their help we localize the disorder exactly and very slowly approach the patient's consciousness. Only now, the third and decisive phase of our treatment begins. The patient's trauma is directly addressed. When he is fully conscious. A conversational therapy can make the treatment a lasting success. That's humbug! - What do you mean, success? - Where will this lead to? Electricity, mister. Muscle spindles. Heard of that? INSTITUTE FOR SUGGESTIVE THERAPY 1929 Dr. Schmidt, the way I see it, the problem is long solved since those affected have either died or the symptoms disappeared over the years. - That's true! - Stop this! Yes, but the closed institutions are bursting with those ill-fated comrades. I'm talking of a thousand, 10,000 men. But it's good if they're all gone! Gentlemen! The brain is an organ, not a poetry book. Many of them are war heroes. Heroes? - What heroes are you talking about? - Systematically removed from our midst, from our everyday life, because they remind us of a disaster which is being glorified by certain circles in our country! They are washouts! They sully the reputation of our army! - Cowards and shirkers! - Enough of this! Dr. Schmidt, you're a disgrace for our profession. - Pseudo science! - You are untenable! Strange methods! What a quack! SEVERIN PHARMACY the construction sites, millions of visitors, the Jews, the hacks. And the prices! And all the broads are ugly. The bad food. The worst food ever. The worst beer, and the poverty. And rashes and scabies and... Am I right or am I right? I actually quite like it here. You're crazy my child You must go to Berlin Where the crazies are That's where you belong. Thank you. HOMEOPATHY ALLOPATHY Reverend, how can I help you? Dr. Schmidt sends me. From now on, this is the medicine for the patient who just left. Barbituric acid derivative. For the first step of the procedure. Ready, set, go. So Kardakov just pretended to be a musician? No, I don't think so, but right now he's mainly doing revolution. Lights off, knife out. Right. Here. Thank you. Because of the black lungs you think he's a railway worker? That's right. - Well deduced, Toni. - Let me see. - Where did you get the stamp from? - Borrowed it. Looks genuine, doesn't it? It says "police". No one will look closely. As long as it's official. Press police officer Ritter. Use your clever head in school, missy. You're daft. - Can't I come along? - To the freight yard? Have you lost your mind or something? What? "RED CASTLE," DETENTION CELL WING MITTE, BERLIN Give me a little bit, yeah? I can't go on any longer. First the negative and the copy, everything. They'll do the same with me as with König. - König shot himself. - But not of his own accord. We'll be back. In the meantime, think about it. - But I can't think anymore! - Yeah, yeah. ANHALTER FREIGHT YARD, KREUZBERG, BERLIN Vessel AB-32-21, positive for phosgene. OK, let's pack up and go over to 64. - Hello. - Hi. You look like someone who could help me. Well then, I'll help you. See? I said that. - Yes, me too. - Good. Here's my all-important question. Go on then. How many trains per week arrive here from Russia? I'd say two or three. When did the last one arrive? Three days ago, the one with the big bang yesterday. Big bang. That's right. Hey, Werner. - Who's she? - Madam here is... With the press. - The juicy press? - So to speak. Berliner Illustrierte. Check it out! My wife reads that. - Do you have ID? - Yes. Alright. I heard one of the wagons exploded. Oh, don't. That's just what I needed. Thank you, Fuchse. Got a light, too? Some moron opened the hatch and... Lick my kettle. That was some whistle. Took out some of our boys. And ever since... you can see for yourself. And inside? There are some experts from Nyssen AG, examining the wagons. Who are the coats? They're all Russians. Secret service or I don't know. They've been here since that thing exploded. It was a Soviet train. Can I take a look inside? Miss. You're something else. That's why I'm here. So that no one takes a look. What? Yesterday? I don't believe it. How could that have happened? This should never have happened. Are you sure the Russians weren't involved? Yes, I read about it. A chemical accident. Alright. I agree. Let's do that. Alright. Let them examine the wagons, and... Let them examine the wagons, and if they find something they want, be my guest. Yes. I'll calm down. Yes. I agree. Excellent, yes. Excellent. Yes. Goodbye, Wegner. Good morning. And what happens in your life after five o'clock? Nothing special. We could see about that. I'll think about it. Who dares wins. I'll think long and hard about it. Careful, miss. That boy is dangerous. Doesn't have his nickname for nothing. Which is? Stick-it-in Fox. Come on now. Nice guys. The two of us, that would have been something. Yes. What a pity. Well, then. Dismount! - Spread out! - On the double. Move it! Faster, faster! - Open the gate. - Yes, but... Open the gate! Stop. No admittance. Search him! Search everyone! Line up, everyone! Search those two. Go on, faster. Everyone at the table, stand up. On the double! Move. Form a line here. Search everyone. Hand over your guns. What is this? I'm guessing you're responsible for this? What makes you think that? Benda, Berlin police, first division. Left pocket. My diplomat's ID. Disarm everyone. That's all of them. Are these registered? Very well. You can collect them tomorrow at police headquarters, on presentation of an owner's card. Right, gentlemen. How kind of you to do our work for us. Let's see your analyses. What's in the wagons? Rath. - It's me. - What is it? I'm at Anhalter freight yard. You should come here. I told you I won't get you out again. - No, this is different. - Different how? I found a trace. The dead Russian. What? That's it for now, Mr. Trokhin. Then we will both find out if this is still a Soviet domestic matter. This matter will surely, how do the Germans say... create some internal waves. That will be unavoidable. Mr. Councillor, the chemists did spot checks. So far only on three wagons. Let us inside. How did you get here? How did you know about this? I'll tell you later. How many wagons are there? - In total, 13. - Stop. - No admittance. - I'm with the club. Still. Restricted area. Sorry. Rath? Rath! Mr. Councillor. - What are you doing here? - We followed a trace. The driver of this train was probably murdered. - Pardon? - His body was found in the Spree river. - In the Landwehrkanal. - Right. Who is she? This is Miss Ritter, typist. Mr. Councillor? Could you come here? I want to know more. Ride in my car? Yes, sure. All samples tested positive for phosphene. - Do I come along? - That's enough for us. - Cordon everything off. - No. Come along. Early evening, at Aschinger? - Half past six should be OK. - Fine. Juicy press. What I'm telling you now is highly confidential. In those sheds there are 13 cases of treason, due to the illegal import of warfare agents. Contraband from the Soviet Union. It's been increasing for years. What exactly are they smuggling? At first, it was conventional weapons in small numbers. Then it became bigger and bigger. Anti-aircraft guns, tanks, heavy guns. And now... poison gas. That's new. Who is importing all of that? Have you heard of the Black Reichswehr? Just some rumors. Secret military. Irregular combat units. They are using a network of stooges for their camouflaged weapon transports. At least two dozens, always different. But the Black Reichswehr is always behind them. But it's hard to prove since that group doesn't officially exist. Well, the body of the railway worker does exist. Maybe that's a clue that will help us. This case could be of the highest importance for us. You must stay on it, Rath. I need any clue that can help me narrow down the suspects. - Who ordered this delivery from Russia? - Alfred Nyssen. - The steel corporation? - Yes. One of their puppets, I guess. We'll take a closer look at him next. The aim of these people is nothing less than the destruction of our democracy. So? Like I said, the Willi Schulze case has priority. You two go round the neighbors, Norbert, you go to Rote Katze. Oh, and at the El Dorado, there's a new gambling team. We'll plant Johannes there. Clear as mud? Off you go, vice squaddies. Just in time, my friend. Are you busy tonight? We're having a little party. I want to introduce you to someone. Guest of honor. We start at seven. - That's nice, Bruno. But... - No. You have to mingle a bit. You'll go mad in here. There you are, finally. We have a date. Would you? Thanks. Didn't Wolter tell you that you can bring me? Thank you. Well then? Wormsstrasse, Köpenick. Where is he? What now, is someone else coming? - I don't know, actually... - I need the table. Oh, there he is. Stefan. Charlotte, what are you doing here, all alone? I was waiting for you. We've got something planned. Are you free? The two of us? Yes. The bill! A little excursion, to Köpenick. Gentlemen, excuse me. Major Scheer asked for absolute darkness for his demonstration. Mauser K-97, officially banned. Comrades, Captain Wolter and I have the honor of introducing the prototype of Zieldrei to you this evening. Why darkness? This model is an absolute world's first. By powder alloying the vision lines with radioactive radium it was possible to develop a functioning rifle scope for darkness. For the first time ever... it is also possible to deploy snipers... in the dark. From what I understood at the freight yard, there was poison gas in the train, I mean in the wagons, not pesticides. And poison gas is banned. So Benda confiscated the train. And the railway worker whom they found dead in the Landwehrkanal... - Good evening. - Evening. He drove the train to Berlin. He's part of that organization. They call themselves Red Fortress. PRINTER'S Funny, it looks deserted. - How do you know all this? - I investigated. I see. - Charlotte, what are you doing? - Why? There's no one here. Look, the putty is not dry. Are you nuts? Here's the key. - We can't just walk in there. - Yes, we can. As clean as when it was delivered. - Why do they renovate the place? - No idea. What would the chief inspector do now? - Wolter? - Yes. Lock up the guy who gave him the clue and then go for dinner. -And Rath, what would he do? -Stay silent. And then do this with his eyebrows. No, seriously. Charlotte? Pull that lever there. - A 'print king'. - A what? That's what they call sheets that are stuck in the press. Oh. What does it say? It's a railway paper... CONSIGNMENT NOTE AB 3-2-2-1. Istanbul. Istanbul? What does the Red Fortress want to do with poison gas in Istanbul? - Oh! Nice of you to come. - Here, potato salad. Great, come in. Gereon, the men are upstairs at Scheers'. The flat above us. - OK. - See you later. Thank you. The railway line from Ypres to Comines. On May 5, 1918, at 8:45 a.m., the second attack of the 30th infantry division, led by General Heisen. Heavy artillery on the other side. The Brits respond with barrage fire. Hand grenade thrower troops. Only Battle Battalion 31 reaches the group of hills. Colonel Seegers is in command. Our men in the crossfire between Zwarteleen and Zillebeke. The enemy ring is blown up. The height is conquered and handed over to the division's chief commander. At exactly 7:51 p.m. Comrades. Today we commemorate the many men from our unit who have fallen. Rahn, Müller, Zangert, Wiedemann, Fischer, Behnke, Michaelis, Kohn. Fallen for Germany. Honor to their memory. Winkelmann, Hase, Röhler, Kuhnert, von Dülmenau, Rosen. The German army. Unbeaten in the field. - Who betrayed us? - Social democrats. I once had a comrade You couldn't find a better one The drum beat to the fight He was marching by my side Keeping up the pace Keeping up the pace A bullet came a-flying Is it meant for me or you? He is torn away He's lying by my feet As if he was a piece of me As if he was a piece of me Retreat! Retreat! Gereon! Gereon. He's lying by my feet As if he was a piece of me As if he was a piece of me Right, comrades. Please come downstairs now. Emmi and the ladies have prepared some snacks. Come. Arndt, you did that really well. Father taught it to me. Yes, but you recited it. With dignity, and appropriately for the occasion. At ease. Nyssen AG is one of the biggest steel producers in the Reich. We'll be causing a storm. Alfred Nyssen personally ordered this shipment. He must face the law for this. The evidence is overwhelming. Those people hate social democracy. They hate the Jews. We are both their personal enemies, Karl. Arresting Alfred Nyssen gives us the opportunity to fight for the strength of the republic. Alright, I agree. Ready for the storm? Yes, this is the chance we've been waiting for. I wish you much success. Good night, president. - Miss Overbeck? - Mr. Councillor? I don't have to tell you that everything you hear in this house is highly confidential. No, I know that. This includes the visitors we have here, right? Yes, sir. Madam has explained everything to me. Very well. Sebald? This is Benda. Please arrange for Alfred Nyssen to be arrested. - Very soon. - I agree. You are beautiful, Lieschen. I'm so happy she is going out again. But I am going out. You're a beautiful woman and much too young to... Emmi, please. And this dress looks great on you. Don't you agree? - Yes. - See? The inspector can also see that it looks great on you. - I don't get that impression from you. - That's a pity. - We hardly ever see you at home anymore. - Work. And I thought you were on the run, you're running out every morning. Excuse me. I wanted to introduce you to someone who knows a Rath in Cologne. There are quite a few Raths. One of 22nd infantry, army group west. Oh. Please excuse me, Emmi, Mrs. Behnke. He's still unattached. I asked him the other day. - Is he really? - Yes. - We can do it just like that. - Major General, Inspector Rath. - Our colleague from Cologne. - I'm honored. Pleased to meet you. Good evening. The captain told me you knew someone named Rath? Yes, I came across a Rath in Emerdingen, when I was forming my cadre. - Anno Rath? - Possibly... A jolly fellow. He could do a standing jump onto any table, and he did, too. -That's my brother. -Charming, funny. When he entered a room, it didn't take two minutes for everyone to talk to him or about him. He was admired without envy. And the wenches, as far as there were any, ran after him in droves. I know what you're talking about. So where is your brother now? Retreat! Are you deaf? Retreat! My brother is still alive. Gereon? Gereon! Gereon! Thank you, Gereon. Thank you. Get up! Get up! Come here, there are two more. Get up! Get up! Come here, you bastard. Come, I said. No! Anno! I was captured... and was forced to leave Anno behind. - Captivity. - For three months. And no trace of your brother? Dozens of tracing requests, war welfare, Red Cross, everywhere. He is secretly holding the line... which we will return to as soon as we get back what belongs to us. Alfred Nyssen? Come with us. To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait until the end Ocean of time Eternal law To ashes, to dust To ashes But not yet now To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait But not yet now Miracles wait until the end
