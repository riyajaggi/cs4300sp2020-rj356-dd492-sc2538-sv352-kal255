 Previously on Babylon Berlin... Mr Benda is not a murderer. He's the head of the polit police. No! Fritz! Your Benda, those were his men. Tell me what to do, and I'll do it. -Fritz, what are you doing here? -You're mistaking me. Fritz, what are you doing here... What is this, Daddy? Else Krämer, I'll be reading your sentence now. For the murder with base motives of your husband Heinrich Krämer

 as well as your child Wilhelm Krämer, you have been sentenced to death. Be courageous and composed in your last heavy steps. I'll bring a light bulb tonight, I promise. Yes, alright. Go on now, you're late. No, I only need seven and a half minutes. -Do you really have to go already? -Yes, I have to go to court. When will you be home from school? Six. I've got Circle of Catholic Helpers today. Six is fine. For what? For the coal that needs to be carried up. Can't he do it? Hey. Off you go. See you tonight.

 What is it? That wasn't a proper goodbye kiss. Helga, please, I have to go. Helga... Stop it. Gereon, Gereon... Not like that! Didn't we want to get married at some point? Yes. But? Gereon? What's going on? What is happening with you? He's come between us again. I missed you. I missed you too. He doesn't want me to play the records anymore. He doesn't want me to sing anymore. To perform. But I do. He got worse since you were gone. Kiss me. Not now. Kiss me. Morning. Good morning. From what we could tell of the still identifiable remains of the victims, the child must have been sitting under the table while the Councillor was standing in front of it when he was hit by the explosion. At the autopsy, a number of bullet fragments were taken as evidence. The inner organs showed multiple ruptures, intrapulmonary, partly caused by the very strong shock wave. Both victims died within seconds. They never had any chance of survival. Very well. No further questions. The court is calling the witness Irmgard Benda. Mrs Benda, from your testimony, the court hopes to gain insight into the personality of the defendant, and we are also interested in your knowledge of her contacts with the National Socialist Party. I don't know anything about Greta Overbeck's political contacts. For me, this person is an entity that was sent to us from hell. She's an envoy of the devil. With a face of innocence... ...which turned out to be evil incarnate. We entrusted our children to her. Gave her a roof over her head and... And also a place in our hearts. But she destroyed that. Mrs Benda, how do you feel after your testimony? Are there any news? All clues have come to nothing so far. And what about the two young men who incited the girl? The National Socialists. So far we haven't found them. But we're not giving up the search. You personally promised me you would find the people behind this crime. I know. You promised me. You can count on me. Operator, which number? Miss? Please connect me with Wannsee 16-0-3. -Thank you. -One moment, I'll connect you. Yes, hello? Hello, this is Helga Rath. CENTRAL ARCHIVE Detective Rath, department four. I need to see the interrogation minutes of the defendant Greta Overbeck. The Benda murder case. -No, you can't. -Pardon? All Benda files have been under lock and key since last week. You need special authorisation. By whose decree? -Can you be more specific? -Councillor Wendt. If you keep repeating this insinuation, it won't become any more true. Fire was opened by the illegally demonstrating communists on the police. No firing orders for self-defence. More criminal charges have been filed against you, Mr Zörgiebel. Against me personally? They are using the chaos instigated by the Bolsheviks on the first of May to start a smear campaign against me. That's why I am asking you to avert further damage which your office would suffer by yet another trial. What do you mean? Your resignation. You are overstepping your competencies, Councillor. In the most outrageous of ways. You are the head of the political police, and subject to directives by me. And now kindly leave my office. Recognising the sign of the times is a virtue of the strong, Mr Zörgiebel. -Councillor. -Mr Rath. Chief Constable. I have a request. Yes. Would you like a drink? -No, thank you. -Yes. But I do. I was at the trial of the Benda murder case. The whole affair is taking a turn we shouldn't be satisfied with. I... Come. -My circulation... -Have a seat. -Do you want some water? -Yes. I've weathered many a storm in this house. But this... What do you mean? That I miss Councillor Benda. And not just as a person, but also as a friend. That's why I came to see you. We can't stand by and watch a fall guy be convicted. A maid who was obviously used. I need to question her again. She gave a comprehensive statement. You can't talk to her during an ongoing trial, that's out of the question. I... I need your support. Why are you coming to me with this? You know who's in charge. I don't trust Councillor Wendt any more than you do. Boss. Peter Glaser, resident of Röntgenstrasse 10 in Charlottenburg. He's our man. Allegedly he's not a gaffer. -What's your profession? -Electrician. But you work at the film studios in Babelsberg? No, never been there before. I've been working at Elmowerk for 15 years. But why do the film studios have a personnel file for you? How would I know? We need to get the producer in. -He can clear this up. -We're on it. Ritter is on her way. And here they come. -What was his name again? -Bellman. The great Jo Bellman. This way, please. Mr Bellman. Good morning, Mr Bellman. Is this him? -Who? -Peter Glaser. Hang on a minute. I know best whether I'm Peter Glaser or not. I don't know this gentleman. Since when has the man you call Peter Glaser been working at the film studios? Only since the shoot started, about ten weeks. -Can you describe him? -Red hair, strong, a strapping guy. Hang on, I've got something. This may help. Here. The shoot of Demon of Passion, 14 September, Betty's birthday. Do you recognise him here? Here you go, Mr Bellman. This one here. This is Peter Glaser. This is Felix. -You know this man? -Sure, Felix Krempin. A former co-worker. -Do you know where he lives? -Somewhere off Kudamm. -Henning, you'll get me the address. -On it. Mr Bellman. Goodbye. Detective, I assumed I'd get the report for the insurance today. I'm afraid that won't happen. -First, we need to find Mr Krempin... -Yes. Mr Krempin, and then we'll see. Do you know what this means? This is ruins. For all those involved. What are you doing here? I went to the bank. -To cancel Mother's savings book. -So? -She had 40 Marks. -No debt? That's good then. Forty Marks? In all her life? I don't want any of it. And the little one? Not either. I thought your eye had recovered. You need to see a doctor. Völckern is in prison, they say. And I can't afford a different one, right? -Anything else? -Yes. I went to see the neighbour, Cziczewicz. She wants you to get in touch. -Why me? -She said she's got something. From Mother. Something only you can pick up. -I see. -Lotte, if this is something... -something that would get us money... -I have to go now. Because if it is jewellery, then... Alright. We'll see. Come on, Ilse, I'll see you out. Oh. Miss Spielmann? I need to ask you a question. Pepita Bar. Don't panic, I won't tell. Tell me, what did you see when the spotlight fell? There was something. Listen, this might be more than a tragic accident. What you say could be of crucial importance. So, what did you see? A ghost. Right. A person? Man... or woman? Can you... can you describe him? What did he look like? He was wearing a cloak. -Miss Ritter. -Yes? Miss Spielmann saw something, a... She saw something. Could you organise an artist? Question her? Yes, of course. If we have any further questions, we'll be in touch, thank you. Come. And please check the orphanages. -Mr Wendth? -Rath! Sorry for interrupting. I need to talk to you urgently. Alright. I think we are done. Work lunch in the sun. You could have had that too if you had said yes to internal revision. Why are the files for the Benda case suddenly under lock and key? Well, the case is explosive. The case hasn't been solved. We investigated all the leads. Nothing points to the National Socialists inciting the defendant. But why does the maid insist on it? Greta Overbeck was seen repeatedly with young Bolsheviks, never with National Socialists. -Benda had enemies in all factions. -Yes. But his biggest adversaries were the Reds. Ever since the first of May. The whole city knows that Benda and Zörgiebel were behind the harsh intervention during the demonstration. But clue leading to the Reds came to nothing. We did investigate. Do you really still think that this trial will reveal the definitive truth? We need to focus our energies on other problems now. So do you. Litten. Hans Litten. Does the name ring a bell? The lawyer? The KPD lawyer. He of the dogged kind. With the support of a few writers and journalists, the guy filed a demand for prosecution. Against Zörgiebel. For what reason? -The casualties of the first of May. -Is that so? I've also been investigating the imbalance within the police. But the biggest problem of our apparatus... is the leadership. The Chief Constable. -Yes. -Why are you telling me all this? Because I have a very high opinion of you, Rath. And because I wish for you not to back the wrong horse. -Have a nice day. -You too. A mask? Miss, half an hour ago you said stocking. Now it's a mask. What is it? A stocking, for sure. Alright. Yes, a bit like that. Where is your sister on such a nice day? I don't know. Maybe she'll still come. Well, she has paid. Yes. The sausages are coming, madam. Thank you, sir. Oh, always at your service, with my utmost pleasure. Who's this? A suspect in the Betty Winter case. -And she saw him? -Apparently. What can you tell me about Tristan Rot and Betty Winter? -Nothing. -But you surely you can tell me something. What do you want to know? Their relationship. Did they get on well? -So-so. -Because? Well, she wanted to go to America, he didn't. I see. One time they even had fisticuffs because of that. She was crying when she came on stage, her make-up all smeared up. Done. Like this? Should it come to light that Betty Winter was murdered the insurance won't pay a penny. And then we, and I mean all of us together, will be left with a good million in debt. Which my bank will relentlessly cut from our ribs. I did this for your wife. Esther, you're my sister-in-law, and we are very grateful to you. But not to you. You should know that. She wanted you to get into the film business, but reputably. -And no monkey business. -Joseph, restrain yourself. So, was it an accident or not? If my word doesn't bear any importance to you, I won't say another word to you. You will find out that we speak another language. And then, any contact between my family and yours will end. Any plans for the weekend? -Mrs Schwarzbach. -Yes? For you. Thank you. Are you nuts? Arndt? Took you for a deer. You could have hit me. No. If I wanted to hit you, I would. Do you know him? Came to visit our neighbours once. What kind of outfit are you? -Catholic Youth. -Gathering leaves for the Pope? -What about you? -FDAJ. What are you doing here? Hunting down you Catholics. I'm in. Aim at the target... One line from the tip of the arrow to the target point. -Hello, Mr Neumann. -Hello. -Is my sister not here? -I'm afraid she left about an hour ago. -Never mind, I'll just have a coffee. -Here you go. Oh, I'll join the gentleman in the back, OK? Detective? Oh, Charlotte. Have a seat. We've got the drawing. A fickle witness, but she told me a few interesting things, about Betty Winter's husband, Tristan Rot. And we got the address of that Krempin guy. May I? Go right ahead. Pardon? Something's preying on your mind, right? I just had a conversation. With whom? With Wendt. I talked to him about the Greta Overbeck case. I don't think Councillor Wendt has any intention on convicting the actual perpetrators. We need to find a way of talking to Greta Overbeck. That's our only chance of getting to the masterminds. Congratulations, Lieutenant. I accept the reverence, Colonel. But on the scales, I'm the winner. Which doesn't make the matter any better. You swine. -Richard. -Yes, Lieutenant? Rub down the horses and put them out to pasture. Come on. In court, the Overbeck girl still claims to have been incited by my men. Why is the Party still involved in this matter? We tried lots of things and put the pressure on. The girl sticks with her accusation. A stubborn house maid can't become the stumbling block of a national movement. Benda is dead. It's your move. I'm working on it. Miss Overbeck will comply. Count on it. The NSdAP must be removed from the public's attention. As long as you don't fulfill this part of our agreement... ...we won't strike again. Neither against the lying press nor anywhere else. A hand is only washed by another hand. Have a nice day, Colonel. This guy Bellman... He's a problem. One we can get rid of? First of all, we need to take this production under our wings. Bellman claims he has everything under control, but I don't trust him. We need to take the rudder ourselves. I'll ram the rudder up his arse if he doesn't toe the line. Will you get it through as an insurance case or do you have your own plans now? Of course not. But who would have thought of a spotlight killing Betty... The two of us have an agreement. You guarantee that our joint enterprise is insured. But not if homicide is investigating. This is a disaster! For me as much as for you. -No. -No? For you it's a disaster. Because you tanked our money. But there is a way out. There is? We'll finish the film. Then we'll get our money, with profit. -Impossible, without our lead actress. -Find a replacement. For the lead actress? In the middle of the film? -Ask your wife, she can explain it to you. -My wife? What does my wife have to do with this? She knows how we work here at the studio. She can explain... Show me your hands. Pardon? Show me your left hand. You know, I don't put much stock in contracts and lawyers. They only cost you money. But I just want to know if we can trust you. If we can count on you. The head line is very pronounced. Someone like this should be able to think clearly and rationally. Six lines on the love line. The life line, I better not mention that. But this one here... It's very weak. Tomorrow, the shoot continues. Lotte? -Do you think something will become of us? -Yes. What do you want to be? We're nothing right now. No, I mean something better. Than who? Than Ilse and Erich, like. Anything that doesn't grow mould would be better. No. No, tell me. Toni. I'll be Chief Constable, and you the top boss. Of what? Of everything. Sleep tight. You too. Mr Krempin? Who are you? Berlin PD. I have a few questions regarding your last job. Final stop. Homicide squad, what do you want from me? Betty Winter was killed by a spotlight that fell down. -Yes, I read about that. -You're the gaffer. I duly signed off. Cut the crap. I wouldn't kill anyone, least of all Betty Winter. Why the false name then? And why do you run from me if you're innocent? I was supposed to sabotage the shoot. Cause trouble, but not kill anyone. -Sabotage it? For whom? -It wasn't supposed to be like that. Winter wasn't supposed to die. Who do you work for? For whom?
