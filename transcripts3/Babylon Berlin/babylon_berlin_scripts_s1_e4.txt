Berlin stays red! Berlin stays red... What is it? Afraid? You stay here. Attention. Berlin stays red! Berlin stays red! Freeze! Holy cow. Did you want to muscle in? I'm afraid we have to go. Duty calls. Right, ladies. We're searching the SO36 area, segment two, for illegal firearms. - Let's do it. - Yes, sir. Let's go! Get back in the flat! Right, comrades. Roundup. House search. Get out of the way. Get out. - Come with us. - What is is? - Shut up! - What do you want from me? SEARCH WARRANT - Do you live alone? - Yes. - When were you born? - In 1837. Up, up. I'll take the fourth floor. Thirty-two flats, and only one single 18th century musket. That's a bit poor for a red capital. They all knew we were coming. Yes, of course. The question is, how. Get out of here. They're already on Weserstrasse. They'll shoot! Take cover! They're shooting everyone! Come on! Holy smoke. Go, go! They're with us! Get down, they're shooting! Get down! And they shoot, just like this? How would they know we're not reds? Hermann! Hermann! Go inside! Go inside! Go inside! Help! Hermann! Help! Hermann! Hurry up, boy! Good lord, they are spoiling for a fight. Help! We need help! Here! Come in here! Help! Anni. I have to... right now... Get some towels, quick. Calm down. Breathe calmly. Look at me. Yes, that's good. Very good. Good. You're beautiful. You too. You're very beautiful. You're shaking. I'm cold, too. Stay here. Stay here! Don't let go. Shit. Is there a doctor around? Number 61, across the street. Take cover, get down! They're shooting everywhere! Let me out. Let me out now! I was hit! No! No! Come in here! What kind of dirty bastards are you? In here, come on! Quick! Run! Come on, girl. It's spring. You can't give up now. You'll want to go out into the warm air, right? The pretty boy will be back with a doctor. And in three weeks' time you'll see each other. You'll go dancing. At the blossom festival in Werder. There's a woman bleeding out across the street. At number 71. Bullets lodged in her back. Therese, you carry on. A sad occasion, doctor. It's never been very nice to see you. Doctor, I'm glad you're here. You found just the right one. - Why? - What happened? Doctor for the poor. Member of the KP, council member for Kreuzberg. They were shot down like sparrows. By whom? The police? - Hang on, comrade. Nobody saw that. - How would you know? We were there. We were nearly killed ourselves. But you weren't. We wouldn't shoot innocent women off balconies. The blood is not even dry yet and you're already covering it up. Covering it up? What are you doing here? You're a vice copper. You're a police officer? Doris. A refill. - Good God, what a load. - Indeed. We're sitting in a gold mine. How long was it? Eleven hours this time. That's 8.80 marks. - You'll get it. - And Gräf's autograph. - You need what? - Signature. - Oh, right. I'll do it later. - But do it. - Yes, I will. - And the money. Go home, ladies. All birds have flown the nest. There's no one here to give you work. There is. A recording clerk for homicide. Here! It's an autopsy. So not someone prone to fainting, OK? So, who dares to do it? It's better than nothing. I'll do it. I'll pick it up later, OK? Fine. This is my train, my goods which I ordered and have paid for. If German customs don't release the goods immediately, this will have consequences, you dilettante. You think it's such a simple matter. But the Russians gave us hell... The train is from Russia. The Russians loaded it. Don't give me that garbage. Wegener. - Tell me what's going on. - I'm afraid it's the Russians. - Told you so. - What about them? What do they want? They want to check the freight. Until this is resolved, the Soviet Union has a legal claim on the contents of the train. How is this possible? They suspect we were smuggling something. From Russia, here? I'm sure we can clear this up. Come on, let's check the details. Now I have to justify myself only because some obscure Communists claim something. Hello, Mr. Nyssen. Have you met? The People's Deputy Trokhin from the Soviet Embassy. Hello. Mr. Nyssen, please don't misunderstand our intervention. We don't want to stop the exchange of goods between our countries. - But you are doing just that. - There is one wagon on this train which has a different freight than the others. Just one single one. What does it contain? My government hasn't authorized me to tell you. At the moment, it's only a suspicion. All this fuss because of a suspicion? - Yes. - Do you know what this freight is worth? Each day that the train sits here costs a fortune. If suspicion is not enough for you... you can go to the police. Which wagon is it? Just tell us the wagon number. I am here to find that out. Here, sign this. So you get your things back. So, which one is it? Nobody knows. The freight documents have disappeared. What? Why? There was an incident when the train arrived. The driver ran off with the papers. I beg your pardon? Can't the wagon be identified right here? - How do you want to do this? - We look into them. As you know, these wagons contain highly toxic pesticides. We can't check them here. Somewhere, you can open them up. Yes. At our facility in Zossen. We've got a shed for such purposes. Take the wagons there. - You have the necessary skilled workers? - Yes, of course. But not before Monday. Very well. Organize it. And we will be present at the check. Seriously, this is number 12, number 13, and it's only midday. She's on you like a tick. You can't stop me from taking part in the autopsy... Right, right! What in God's name is going on? - I can tell you that. - No, you won't. Ah, it's Ms. Stalina in person. In the name of so-called democracy, innocent people are executed and... - Stop the slander. - These two women were shot by out-of-control police. You paint the enemy where you want him. Shoot first, ask second, that's how it works here - when workers exercise their rights. - You know nothing about this. You're turning a blind eye on everyone who is openly breaking the law. What law did they break exactly? - Agitator. - Cover-upper. - Subversive. - Murderer! - Bruno! - That's enough. Put them up here. Left-hand corner. Exactly where they belong. Here we go again! Put them in the centre of the table then. Hang on. I have no use for you in here, doctor. I won't leave these people alone with the victims. No, please. How am I supposed to work with all that racket? I'm staying. This is my dissecting room and I decide who gets to dissect with me. Not you! Look, it's the doctor for the poor. Traffic police, what are you doing here? Lunch break. It's so cosy here. Why are you bringing a broad to an autopsy? Seriously, do you have to? Everyone else is busy. Why do you have two bodies? None of your business. Bruno, why don't you go to the canteen and order a burger? They taste like the smell in here. So, what does our canal swimmer tell us? Am I the autopsy express? This is rush hour traffic today. But judging by his skull I'd say... he looks like Slavic. Maybe Russian. That man was a Russian. At least he spoke Russian. I see. And who are you? Gereon Rath, special investigator from Cologne. What does a Cologne special investigator know about a body from a Berlin canal? That man broke into my flat last night. At Elisabeth's place? Did he steal anything? What did he want? Something from the previous tenant, a certain Mr. Kardakov. When he tried to escape, he was pushed into a car and threatened with a gun. - What make? - Could have been a Tatra. Sounds like a Russian affair. Maybe. His hands didn't look like this yesterday. What happened? Massive contusions. Must have been under a car. Doesn't look like an accident though. I beg your pardon. - So... - You mean this was done to him? Well, the injuries look even, don't they? Girl, have you just learned to talk or why are you blabbing on? Get out. What about your previous tenant, what was his name? I said get out! Kardakov. That's all I know. My landlady didn't know him very well, either, but I might... You might confirm this guy is Russian? - Yes. - Very well. Let's write that down. Case closed. Your students can turn this Bolshevik into burgers or something. Excuse me, but this man may have been tortured. In Berlin, the Russians off each other around the clock. Every man for himself. One is a Trotskyite, the other Leninist, Stalinist, anarchist or even tsarist. It's too confusing. The more of them go, the better for us. I'll address the autopsy report to you, Detective Sergeant? - You can stuff it. - Goodbye, Mr. Criminal. If we had a special squad for each dead Russian... What's this? No idea. A four? A ten-pack of Overstolz. - One fifty. - And I'll have a newspaper. - A Morgenpost. - Thank you. BLOODY RIOTS IN KREUZBERG AND WEDDING - For you? - A two-pack of Havana Gold, please. That's 1.50. You smoke cigars? Oh. It's for the boss. I don't envy you. Oh, he's not always like this. - You mean, he's actually a nice guy? - No. But sometimes he's less gruff. Well, then. We can ignore the odd murder. I don't like it, either. That man was scared. He wasn't a tough guy. I realized that too late. You want to investigate? It's not that simple. It's your department. But no one would ask any questions if you did some research. My boss would ask. He doesn't have to know. - Cigarette? - Thank you. For better times. Alright. So what else does your landlady know about this Kardakov? You remembered the name. I've got two ears. So? Not much. Allegedly, he's on tour. But he didn't take his suitcase. Interesting. I have to go. I'll be in touch. Alright. And thank you again. For the other day. - Traitor! - What is going on? - You'll pay for this. - Why weren't you at the station? You're asking me? They were all killed because of you. - They're all dead! - What? Who? Nadia, Nikolayev, Sergey, Misha, Yuri, Vladimir. They are all on your conscience. - Where is the damned knife? - It was Boris. The train driver betrayed us. He wanted it all for himself, to take the gold to Paris. He fled and left me there... I'll kill you, you whore! And I was arrested. Look. From the police. Where is the gold? The gold is there. I was in the wagon. I saw it myself. Lyosha, please believe me. The train is at the station. Dearest, nothing is lost yet. Please believe me. My love. Did you really think I could betray you? Look at me. You really thought I could do something like this? Yes? Yes. No. They killed them all. They killed them all. Forgive me. I'LL SEW ANYTHING WORK WANTED SHOEMAKER LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT LOOKING FOR WORK - Can you watch this for me? - Yes, sure. Don't you recognize me anymore? Kinderland holiday in '22. Greta! Greta Overbeck from Gröningshusen on Darss? What are you doing in Berlin? Well... I... I'm on my lunch break, are you hungry? Me? No, thanks, I've eaten. Come on, it's on me. - I only came here because of him. - I see. Anyway, suddenly Alfons disappeared off the face of the Earth. Simply gone. Somehow I've heard this story before. My parents had warned me about him. And the only one I met through Alfons was an older gentleman. A famous author, I won't tell you who. Go on. - No. - Yes. - Him? - Yes. He helped me at first. Then he asked me if I wanted to do his flat for him. Very gently, like. In a fatherly voice. Two days later I was back on the street. And I'm still there. No one takes on a maid without a first-hand recommendation. Would you know something? Maybe. Yes. At least you had a bit of luck. Charlotte Ritter, what was it again? Assistant investigator? Correct. And if I put some work into it, I can even become an inspector. With the homicide squad? That'll be 60 pfennigs. Some of the guys are pretty strange, but my boss trusts me blindly. Thank you. And do you get to see the... those that were murdered? The murder victims? Of course. I'm always first on the scene, me and the detective sergeant. Gruesome stuff sometimes. Recently we had one with no head. - The axe was still there. - No! Then we found the head later. You won't believe where. Where? Excuse me. Oh, it's... one o'clock already. I have to run. But listen, are you up for going dancing later? Alright. At Moka Efti, Friedrichstrasse, 9 p.m. I'm glad you're here. Department A. Homicide and Aggravated Assault. Miss Isolde, did you do the two transcripts I asked for? Please go downstairs for your money. Hello. This is really scary. Miss Isolde. What is it? I have a question. How do you become an assistant investigator? - Did you finish school? - Elementary school. I'd say write an application. - Vicky, the Huber file. - Just like that? Yes, I'm coming. - To whom? - The female police. - Who else? - Female police? What do they do? They question and deal with sexual and vice offenses of minors. I want the homicide squad. You want the homicide squad? They don't have any women. Only as typists. Where do I get those application forms? Personnel office. Thank you. Forgive me, Sveta. I saw it all happening. I could do nothing. Calm down. We'll find a way. You have me. We'll get the gold. Trotsky will destroy Stalin. With our help. With our gold. Yes, the Russians met here a few times. His organization is called "Red Fortress". Thanks. For the best socialism ever. They were all fervent Trotskyites. Does that mean anything to you? It's a communist faction, against Stalin. They want to free their country from his yoke. "Stalin is the gravedigger of the revolution." You speak Russian? It's essential if you're interested in the giants. Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy. I personally think Gulanin is underestimated. It was wrong to forget about him. Through my room! Thank God I wasn't there. Yes, good thing you weren't there and I had to deal with him on my own. Please, Ms. Elisabeth, I didn't mean it like that. No, I'm sure you would have driven him away. That's right, with the stench of my un-aired room. Bloody May! Police! Bloody May! Police! Don't touch the car, get back! Murderers! Charlotte! This way! It's great, right? Look at this. Can I try it on? Thank you. Go on, take it. - Can you afford this? - No. You are wanted. Where? He's already here. First room on the left. I'll explain later. Won't take long. What about you? Don't tell me you're a virgin. No, I'm Capricorn. - Where's the Widow? - I'm the substitute. What do you want from her? - I've got someone for her. - She'll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks. What? Have you never seen a man in an armchair? I'm not available for detective sergeants. Don't worry. - I only do standard dances. - Forget it. I'm not a whore. You're not registered, that's true. What's that supposed to mean? It means you'll look at paragraph 361/6 of the criminal code. Then you'll know you have to register... for your job here. Meaning you'll register with us. With the vice squad. I was just here by accident. That's also a solution. Smart child. But you don't want me to take this place apart, right? You'd be back on the street, hunting for clients. Let's deal with this just the two of us. Right now. Go on, let's dance. Come on now. No. Excuse me, miss. Your dress is fantastic. Do you want to dance? Miss, are you accompanied? Is that it? Not quite. You and the posh Cologne guy... I saw you flirting with him already. That gentleman is a bit too curious for my liking. What's that to do with me? Find out what he's looking for. Why should I do that? Because otherwise all this will be in your certificate of good conduct. That's not clean, anyway. But it has to be if you want to keep working for the police. Can you do something about that? I could have a look. I have this letter in Russian. Can you tell me what it says? I won't tell you the intimate conversation between my flatmate and his lover. I'm afraid you'll have to. Because you'll arrest me if I don't? That's right. Alright, if you insist. Ready? Darling, please pick up my dress from the cleaners. Kisses, S. Svetlana Sorokina. Who is she? Kardakov's lover, like I said. He went round her place a lot. As you know, Mrs. Behnke doesn't like lady visitors. I don't like the ladies that visit you. What about family? Where would that get us? They have hotels for that. Behnke speaking. One moment, please. Mr. Rath? It's for you. The chief of police. Rath. It's me. Who? I wanted to ask if you have looked into the previous tenant. That's what you're calling for? I wanted to take advantage of the office phone. If there is anything that needs to be done, I am available. Actually, I have something for you. Kardakov's lover lives at Meraner Strasse number seven. Svetlana Sorokina. Write it down. - Consider it done. - Go check it out tomorrow, OK? Do you know the Aschinger inn? Is the earth round? Yes, of course. I'll meet you there for lunch tomorrow at one o'clock p.m. Yes, fine. Talk soon. I'm meeting him. Tomorrow at 1 p.m. at Aschinger's. Good. And where will we meet? Here, of course. Come on. At least 200 dead. I can't imagine that. I don't believe Mr. Rath has anything to do with that. - But he was on duty in Kreuzberg today. - Samuel, enough of that, OK? Well, what will we do with the other half of the evening? Are you together? Good. - Are you alone? - Yes. - No children? - No. I'm sorry, we're full up. Only women with children for tonight. Hello? Put me through to the Soviet embassy. To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait until the end Ocean of time Eternal law To ashes, to dust To ashes But not yet now It must be just a dream Trying to snatch the wind Who really knows? The clock on your wall It is filled with sand Put your hand in mine And let us be forever Now you make your choice And throw us in between happiness and agony
