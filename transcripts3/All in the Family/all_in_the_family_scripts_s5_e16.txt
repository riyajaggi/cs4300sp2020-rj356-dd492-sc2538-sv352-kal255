I NEEDED WATER, ARCHIE TO COOK DINNER WITH. OH, YOU AIN'T COOKING MY DINNER IN THAT KIND OF WATER, EDITH.

WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, LEAVE BEFORE THE JOB IS FINISHED? WE AIN'T GOT NO WATER HERE. I'M SORRY, ARCH, BUT, UH, WE'LL BE BACK EARLY IN THE MORNING. I GOTTA GET NICK BACK ON TIME, OR I'LL BE IN TROUBLE. WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT... WHAT IS THIS? WHAT TROUBLE? WHAT TROUBLE? DON'T ANSWER MY QUESTION WITH MY SAME QUESTION. WHAT TROUBLE? WHAT IS IT? MA, WHY CAN'T YOU TELL HIM? MR. HOWARD IS ON A WORK FURLOUGH FROM SING SING. SING SING? IT'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE, DADDY. SING SING IS LEGITIMATE? SING SING... WE GOT A PLUMBER HERE FROM SING SING? YEAH, ONLY PART-TIME, ARCHIE. HE WORKS DAYS, AND THEN HE GOES HOME TO THE SLAMMER AT NIGHT. THAT'S THE SAME PLACE JIMMY CAGNEY USED TO CALL "THE BIG HOUSE." AH! WHAT IS THIS, WE GOT A KILLER FOR A PLUMBER HERE? NO, JUST AN ARMED ROBBER. JUST AN ARMED ROBBER. DO YOU KNOW WHAT BEING SENT UP FOR ARMED ROBBERY MEANS? IT MEANS HE WASN'T VERY GOOD AT IT. SHUT UP, YOU! ARCH, IT'S JUST PART OF A NEW REHABILITATION PROGRAM. WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME? WITH GUYS BREAKING INTO YOUR HOMES AT NIGHT, NOW THEY'RE GONNA LET CONS OUT TO MAKE HOUSE CALLS IN THE DAYTIME? OH, NO, NO, NO. I'LL PUT A STOP TO THIS RIGHT NOW. ARCHIE, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I'M GONNA CALL UP STRINSKI'S SHOP. I'M GONNA LEAVE WORD I DON'T WANT A CONVICT WORKIN' AROUND HERE. OH, NO, ARCHIE, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT. THEY MAY NOT LET HIM OUT AGAIN. OH, I'M GONNA MAKE THIS CALL. OH... OH, PUT THAT PHONE DOWN. I AM GONNA MAKE THE CALL. PUT... PUT THE PHONE DOWN! I AM GONNA MAKE THE CALL. PUT THE PHONE DOWN, DAMN IT! IN FRONT OF THE KIDS? [grunting] [sighing] ARCHIE, WHERE ARE YOU? [toilet flushing] OH. (Edith) ARCHIE. IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? DO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT? NO! I HAD A BAD DREAM. OH, YOU WANNA TELL ME ABOUT IT? YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? I DREAMED I HAD TO GO UP TO GO TO THE JOHN, AND IT WAS MISSIN'. IT SCARED ME SO BAD, I WOKE MYSELF UP. THEN I FIGURED, I'D BETTER GO IN AND CHECK HERE. AND WAS IT STILL THERE? YEAH, IT WAS THERE. SO I FIGURED, WELL, AS LONG AS I'M IN THERE ANYWAY. THAT WAS A FUNNY DREAM. WHAT THE HELL WAS FUNNY ABOUT IT? IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR NOT LETTING ME CALL UP AND STOP THAT CONVICT FROM COMING HERE. OH, ARCHIE, MR. HOWARD WOULDN'T HURT NOBODY. [groan] HE HAS A NICE, GENTLE FACE. OH, JEEZ, SO DID "BABY FACE" NELSON, SO DID "PRETTY BOY" FLOYD, SO DID TONY CURTIS. TONY CURTIS? YEAH, DON'T YOU REMEMBER TONY CURTIS IN THE BOSTON STRANGLER? HE USED TO GO AROUND RINGING LADIES' DOOR BELLS, THERE. AND OF COURSE, THEY ALL OPENED THE DOOR, BECAUSE WHO'S GONNA SLAM A DOOR IN TONY CURTIS' FACE? OH, NO, THEY'D GIVE HIM A BIG SMILE, LET HIM IN. 10 MINUTES LATER, THEY'D GIVE HIM A BIGGER SMILE, RIGHT ACROSS THE THROAT. I WAS TALKING TO THE BOYS DOWN AT KELSEY'S ABOUT IT, EDITH. THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING: THEY ALL SAY THEY WOULD NOT HAVE A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL WORKING IN THEIR HOUSE. MR. HOWARD AIN'T DANGEROUS. IF HE WAS DANGEROUS, SING SING WOULDN'T LET HIM OUT DAYS TO WORK. AH, SING SING HADN'T OUGHT TO LET HIM OUT AT ALL. GUY WANTS TO GET OUT OF THE PEN BEFORE SERVING HIS TIME, WELL, LET HIM ESCAPE LIKE OTHER GUYS. JEEZ, EDITH, WHEN YOU THINK OF IT, YOU KNOW, ARMED ROBBERY. YEAH, BUT HE ONLY USED A TOY GUN. OH, OH, OH, OH, OH. IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU? YEAH. [scoffing] AND HE SHOWED ME A CARD TRICK, TOO. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU. AH, JEEZ. SHE'S GONNA DO ME A CARD TRICK AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING. YEAH, I BEEN PRACTICING. [moaning] NOW WATCH. WHAT ELSE CAN I DO? [exclaiming] SORRY. BOY, EDITH, THAT WAS SLICK. ARCH, THESE PROGRAMS GIVE GUYS LIKE NICK A CHANCE TO BECOME USEFUL CITIZENS. YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. AND THE GUY'S PROBABLY STICKING UP A BANK ON HIS WAY HERE NOW. HE CAN'T. THEY AIN'T OPEN YET. ARCH, WE GOTTA HELP NICK. OTHERWISE, HE'S JUST GONNA GO ON ROBBIN'. I CAN TELL YOU HOW TO KEEP SOME OF THESE GUYS FROM ROBBIN'. OH YEAH. THIS I GOTTA HEAR. GO AHEAD. WELL, ALL RIGHT. FOR ONE THING, TAKE A BANK. YOU KNOW IN BEHIND THE TELLER'S CAGE, THERE? THE GIRL OUGHT TO HAVE A BUTTON ON THE FLOOR, SEE. SO WHEN A GUNMAN COMES UP WITH A GUN, HE STICKS IT THERE, SHE TAPS THAT BUTTON THERE, A TRAP DOOR OPENS, THE CROOK GOES RIGHT DOWN THE SHOOT AND SLIDES RIGHT TO THE NEAREST POLICE STATION. THAT'S BRILLIANT. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA COME UP WITH SOMETHIN' STUPID. I FOOLED YOU, HUH? I GOT SOMETHIN' JUST AS GOOD AS THAT. WAIT TILL YOU HEAR THIS. SHOULD I BE WRITIN' THIS DOWN? NO, IT'S SHORT. YOU CAN REMEMBER IT. YOU KNOW INSIDE THE BANK, IN THE UPPER PART THERE, WHAT THEY CALL A MEZZERINE, THERE? YEAH. ALL RIGHT, YOU PUT 3 SHARP SHOOTERS RIGHT THERE, IN THE MEZZERINE. WHEN A CROOK GOES UP TO THE TELLER'S CAGE AND TAKES OUT HIS GUN, THE 3 SHARP SHOOTERS UP THERE, THEY BLAST HIM. ARCH, WHAT IF ONE OF THE SHARP SHOOTERS ACCIDENTALLY HITS A LITTLE OLD LADY, STANDING BEHIND THE CROOK? WELL, SO WHAT? THE OTHER 2 SHARP SHOOTERS AIN'T GONNA MISS THE CROOK. I WONDER WHAT'S KEEPING GLORIA. SHE'LL BE LATE FOR WORK. OH, SHE'S NOT GOING TO WORK TODAY, MA. SHE'S GOT A LITTLE COLD. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN', YOUR DAUGHTER NEVER HAD NO COLDS BEFORE SHE GOT MARRIED. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? IT MEANS, THAT WHEN SHE WAS SINGLE, SHE ALWAYS WORE SOMETHIN' TO BED. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE KIND OF REMARK I'D EXPECT FROM A GUY WHO WANTS TO SLIDE CROOKS UNDER THE CITY. I'M GONNA TAKE THIS UP TO GLORIA. OH, THAT'S NICE, MIKE. ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GO TO WORK, EDITH. NOW, REMEMBER, WHEN THAT BOSS PLUMBER STRINSKI GETS HERE, I WANT HIM TO STICK AROUND AT ALL TIMES WHILE THE CONVICT IS WORKING HERE IN THE HOUSE, HUH? ALL RIGHT, ARCHIE. REMEMBER THAT, NOW. NOW, HERE'S YOUR LUNCH. HAVE A NICE DAY. YEAH, OH, EASY, EASY, ON THIS SIDE. ALL RIGHT. OK, REMEMBER NOW, YOU KEEP YOUR DISTANCE, UH? KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. YEAH, I WILL. HERE. [chuckling] GOOD MORNING, MR. BUNKER. OH, GOOD MORNING THERE. WHERE'S THE WARDEN? I MEAN, UH, WHERE'S STRINSKI, THE BOSS? AH, HE'LL BE BY LATER. CAN I COME IN? OH, YEAH, YEAH. COME ON IN, COME ON IN. UH, HOW MUCH LATER? GOOD MORNING, MR. HOWARD. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME BREAKFAST? [exclaiming] NO, I THINK I'D BETTER GET RIGHT TO WORK. WELL, HOW ABOUT SOME... I TOLD YOU, KEEP YOUR DISTANCE FROM THE MAN. THEY DON'T HAVE GIRLS UP THERE IN SING SING. A WOMAN GOES SLITHERING BY A GUY LIKE THAT, HE'D GO BERSERK. WELL, SEE YOU LATER. (Edith) GOODBYE, MIKE. WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE. WHERE ARE YOU GOIN', MEATHEAD? I GOT AN EARLY CLASS. I'M GOING TO SCHOOL. WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE? SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. SHE'S JUST GOT A LITTLE HEAD COLD. WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE. A HEAD COLD NEVER STOPPED A SEX PREVERT. NO, THAT'S TRUE. NOT IF HE REALLY LOVES THE GIRL. BUT I STILL GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL. WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU, YOU DOPE, YOU. I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE WOMEN, THERE AND THE CONVICT IN THE KITCHEN. IN THE KITCHEN ALONE WITH EDITH, AND I DON'T HEAR ANY BREATHING. HEY, EDITH, EDITH. OH, ARCHIE, ARE YOU STILL HERE? EDITH. [inaudible] DISTANCE. I WANT YOU TO CALL THE PLANT ON THE PHONE, RIGHT AWAY. TELL 'EM I AIN'T COMIN' IN FOR WORK. TELL 'EM THIS TOOTH IS FLASHIN' UP ON ME AGAIN. OH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT. AS SOON AS I GET BACK. WHERE YOU GOIN'? I'M GOIN' OVER TO LOUISE'S, TO BORROW SOME ASPIRIN FOR GLORIA'S COLD AND FOR YOUR TOOTH. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. YEAH. OH. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. HURRY UP. OH, YOU OUGHT TO SEE A DENTIST ABOUT THAT TOOTH, MR. BUNKER. OH, NO. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. I DON'T THINK I WANNA GO TO WORK, ANYWAY. I THINK I'LL STAY HOME. MAYBE I'LL USE MY TIME TO, UH, INSPECT AND CLEAN MY GUNS. OH, YOU'RE A GUN COLLECTOR, MR. BUNKER? WELL, I GOT A COUPLE OF SOUVENIRS, UH, I TOOK OFF THE KRAUTS IN THE WAR. YOU KNOW, W.W.II, THE BIG ONE. I GOT A .45 CALIBER GERMAN SCHMAUSER, THERE. AND, UH, OVER HERE, I GOT A .38 CALIBER GERMAN FLUGEL WITH A TELEPHONIC SIGHT. I SHOT A GERMAN COLONEL IN THE BUTT WITH THAT. WELL, YOU MUST HAVE SEEN PLENTY ACTION. [stammering] WHERE YOU GOIN'? UPSTAIRS. I GOTTA WORK ON THE BATHROOM. AH, W-W-W-WAIT A MINUTE, THERE. WAIT A MINUTE, NOW. I... I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO DO THAT BECAUSE, UH, MY DAUGHTER IS UP THERE, TAKING A SHOWER. SHE AIN'T GONNA GET VERY WET. I TURNED OFF THE WATER. YEAH, WELL, WAIT. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. NO, WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS THAT, UH, UH, SHE'S TAKIN' A NAP UP THERE, AND I-I-I WOULDN'T WANT THE WORK, YOU KNOW, TO WAKE HER UP. SO, WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHIN' ELSE, LIKE, YOU COULD TAKE MAYBE A WALK AROUND THE BLOCK UNTIL STRINSKI THE BOSS GETS HERE. MR. BUNKER, IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME BEING UPSTAIRS WITH YOUR DAUGHTER... YEAH, WELL, WELL, I AM. I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT. THAT'S WHY I GET SO UPTIGHT BEING ON THE OUTSIDE. HOLD ON, HOLD ON. H-H-HOLD IT, NICK. WHAT? YOU NEVER WANNA EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS WITH A MONKEY WRENCH. [doorbell ringing] THERE'S THE BELL. I THINK I'LL ANSWER IT, OK? SURE. YEAH, NOW, DON'T GET UPTIGHT ABOUT NOTHIN'. DON'T GET UPTIGHT, NICK. NO, I'LL... I'LL... I'LL JUST, UH, ANSWER THE BELL, OVER HERE, EH? (Archie) YEAH. STRINSKI, IT'S ABOUT TIME. GET IN HERE. THANKS A LOT, ARCH. WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? FOR POPPING OFF AT KELSEY'S LAST NIGHT. HUH?

I NEVER SAID NOTHIN' ABOUT THE MAFIA. ALL I KNOW IS BARNEY HEFNER CALLED ME. HE SAID HE DON'T WANT NO KILLERS WORKIN' ON HIS WATER HEATER. OH, BARNEY HEFNER, JEEZ. FEW MORE REMARKS LIKE THAT, I'M GONNA BE OUT OF BUSINESS. NOW, LOOK, MR. STRINSKI, YOU KNOW, IF IT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM, MAYBE I BETTER NOT GO WITH YOU ON THAT HEFNER JOB. THAT'S RIGHT.

I WOULDN'T TAKE NO JOBS UP IN THE EAST BRONX 'CAUSE THERE'S A STRONG CRIMINAL ELEMENT UP THERE. WILL YOU KNOCK IT OFF? IT'S YOUR FAULT TO START WITH. WHAT? NO, IT'S NOT HIS FAULT. IT'S MY FAULT. YOU KNOW, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, THAN TO EVER LET THEM TALK ME INTO THIS COCKAMAMIE FURLOUGH SCHEME. I THINK I'M GONNA GIVE UP PLUMBIN' UNTIL THEY START REHABILITATIN' YOU PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE. OH, NO, MR. HOWARD. YOU MUSTN'T GIVE UP. REMEMBER: "FAILURE COMES FROM THE INSIDE FIRST "IT'S THERE IF WE ONLY KNEW IT "AND YOU CAN WIN, THOUGH YOU FACE THE WORST IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IT" EDGAR A. GUEST.
