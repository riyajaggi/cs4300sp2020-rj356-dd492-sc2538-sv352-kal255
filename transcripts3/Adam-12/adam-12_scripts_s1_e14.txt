 he came barreling in Code 3. Don't tell me! You guessed it. [sighing] Malloy? Yeah? What happened? Did I miss part of the story? Why was he suspended? Well, the other car was Code 3, too, officially. Oh. You mean, he was making so much noise, he couldn't hear the other siren and the two cars, uh... Anybody hurt? Just Kirby and he's hurtin' about $400 worth. All right, men, here's tonight's car plan. 57: Brooks and Martin, 27: Garcia and Edwards,

 43: Walters and Brinkman, 27: Baldwin and King, 12: Malloy and Reed, 18: Sanchez and Johnson, 34: Rhodes and Siller. I have subpoenas for Sanchez, Baldwin, and Johnson. Sign them and return them to Sergeant MacDonald. There's been a complaint about vandalism at the Panoramic Drive-in Theatre. That would be Adam-18. Check it out, if you haven't already seen the movie. Yes, sir. A West L.A. stolen to add to your hot sheet. In the Four column, Frank, Boy, Ocean, 449. Blue, '63, Pontiac. Sergeant MacDonald will continue with the training discussion on officer safety. Sergeant? We've been talking about Patrol Bureau Memorandum 39. Like it says, an officer gets into many different kinds of emotionally charged situations. The best guarantee any of you have that such a situation won't get out of hand is "Officer Presence." In simple English, that means... (Moore) ...remember, when you're up against a criminal, if you believe that you're a better man than he is, he'll believe it, too. (MacDonald) Any questions? All right, fall in for inspection. I guess there is more to Officer Presence than just being there. Does that mean, you got more presence if you're as big as Baldwin? That's not presence, that's lard. I had a partner once that had the best appearance of anybody I ever saw. Is that right? How was his presence? Absent. Malloy? Yeah? About that Officer Presence business, does it really work? It depends. On what? On whether you really understand how to use it. The trouble is I don't think I do understand. What? How to use it. Well, why didn't you ask some questions back at roll call? I don't know. I guess I was just afraid of sounding stupid back there. You know, in front of the whole watch. Besides, you figured you could always ask me. You're my partner. It's supposed to be part of your job. Okay, ask. I'd like to know how you impose your presence other than by, well, just being there. You let people know who you are, what you represent. Mostly, its the way you talk to 'em. You really think that does it, huh? Usually. Unless your voice cracks in the middle. (female dispatcher) All units in the vicinity and 1-Adam-18. 211 in progress, 11890, Santa Monica Boulevard. 1-Adam-18 handle Code 3. 11890. I got it. [tires screeching] (Johnson) Reed! Take it easy, there'll be an ambulance here in a few minutes. There's no phone inside there. Somebody else must have reported it. Better take a look around for him. Right. (Leroy) How's Charlie? Is Charlie okay? It could've been me. I was just getting ready to go on my shift. In five minutes, it would've been... What did he do to him? Looks like he's been pistol-whipped. Did you see who did it? Yeah, I saw him. He had a gun all right. That's why I couldn't come and help Charlie. "Call the cops," that's what they tell us. They've got strict rules. Get to a phone and call the cops. Don't let it bug you, you did the right thing. Now can you give us a description? Yeah, a young fella, 20, 22. Light hair, white shirt. Height and weight? Uh, kind of a tall, skinny guy. That's all I could see at first glance. What kind of car? I didn't see any car. He just hiked off down the alley. Which way? South. Okay, thanks. We'll get it on the air. 1-Adam-12, reporting a Code 4 Adam at the service station at 11890, Santa Monica Boulevard and request a clear frequency. (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, roger. All units, Code 4 Adam. 11890, Santa Monica Boulevard. All units on Frequency 1, standby. (Reed) Sir. [dog barking] S-S-Something wrong? Have you seen anybody walking along this street? Well, it seems like when I first came out there was someone here. How long ago? Well, I've been out about, uh, 10 minutes. In another five, I take them back home. Every day, good weather or bad, it's the same thing. Walk the dogs, walk the dogs. You'd think that just one time that wife of mine would walk her own dumb dogs. Can you describe the man? I doubt it. With these two you gotta keep your mind on your business. Did you notice what he was wearing? He had on a white shirt. I thought it was kind of funny to--to be out in such chilly weather with no--no coat or sweater. Uh, but then maybe he had one in his car. Oh, he had a car, what kind? L-I-it was a red convertible, I think. Uh, you know, the--the kind that a young fella might drive. Struck me as being quite young. Which way did he go? Drove off down there. Thanks for the help, sir. Well, that's something. Yeah. What? A red convertible. So put out a supplemental and clear us. Malloy, I've been thinking about that car. Maybe if we worked the neighborhood-- We'd burn a lot of rubber for nothing. The car was probably stolen. And he's had time to dump it. Or we just might turn it up. So we report a hot car sitting. Will it make you feel any better? No, what would make me feel better is busting that guy. Look, he's had at least a 10-minute start. Even if the car was his, he's out of the area already. He's gone, Reed, he got away. In this business you can't win 'em all. I don't know. Just doesn't seem right. It isn't right. That's why there's a law against it. I mean, why write it off? (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12. See a woman, a found adult. 1741, North Argent Street. That's why. 'Cause there are more calls than there are cops. 1-Adam-12, roger. Someone here call the police? Oh yes, Officers, I did. I'm Mrs. Devers. The strangest thing happened. We've got a darling little man, in there. The one in the back. (Malloy) What about him? Well, he doesn't belong here. Why not? Uh, I mean, he's not one of ours. Where did he come from? Nobody seems to know. We don't know who he is or where he lives. Well, didn't you ask him? Well, he's a little confused. A little tired, not very coherent. Well, how'd he get in here? Well, we seem to think that he saw some of our people this afternoon, during our open air enjoyment period and simply joined them. When we brought the others in, he was swept up with them. He's a darling little man. Somebody must be terribly worried about him. Let's have a talk with him. [TV playing] Feeling a little better? We gave him his dinner, of course. What's that? He's a little hard of hearing. These men are going to see you get home safely. Well, that's all right. What's your name, sir? What? Can you tell us your name? No reason why I shouldn't. [chuckling] I'm not wanted for anything. Do you think I'm a criminal or something? No, sir. We just like to know your name and where you live. Saulsberry. James Howard Saulsberry. That's more than I could get out of him. I'll leave you alone with these officers now, Mr. Saulsberry. You're doing fine. Where do you live, Mr. Saulsberry? Deadwood. Deadwood? Where's that? South Dakota. Thought everybody knew Deadwood. Didn't you never hear of Wild Bill Hickok? (Reed) Yes, sir, I've heard of him. Well, Wild Bill got gunned down in Deadwood. Shot in the back whilst he was playing poker in a saloon. We need to know your address here. Where? Here, in Los Angeles. That's where you are now. Los Angeles, California. Yeah, visiting my daughter. That's where she lives. Los Angeles. California. Winters is nice there, but it ain't the same. I'll be going back to Dakota when it warms up. What's your daughter's name? Martha. Martha... Martha Saulsberry that was, uh... Do you know her address? No. But I got it written down somewhere. Could we take a look at it, sir? Yeah, uh... Don't seem to have it anymore. What about your identification? What's that? Identification. Something with your name on it. Oh. Could I give you a hand with that, sir? No, nothin'. You better check with Missing Persons. They must have a report on him. Right. Here you are, Mr. Saulsberry. My daughter took me shoppin' today. Doesn't like to leave me home alone. [chuckling] Thinks I'll run away. Doesn't have the brains to pour water out of a boot. She went into a department store, a big one, forget the name. Said she'd be only a minute, to wait for her in the car. But you didn't wait, did you? What? What's that? (Malloy) You took a walk, didn't you? Who said so? Well? Missing Persons had it all right. Mr. Saulsberry, your daughter's name is Mrs. Donald Peters. Peters. That's the fella's name. He left her, you know. I never liked him very much anyway. Lives on Palisades Avenue. In Santa Monica? (Mrs. Devers) That's five miles or more. How do you suppose he got so far? Beats me. But we'll take him back out there. These officers are going to give you a ride home, Mr. Saulsberry. All right. But what about Martha's car? Who's going to take it back? Where is it? It's out in front. Is that how you got here, in Martha's car? Malloy, he couldn't have driven the car himself. The missing persons report says he's 91 years old. Where were you going today, Mr. Saulsberry? Dakota. Back to Deadwood. It's a mighty long drive so I got an early start. Can you tell me, do I have much further to go? No, sir. Not much further. You still checking for red convertibles? You never know. Well, even if we don't turn it, getting the old man back home should've helped. How do you mean? You've done your good deed for the day. (female dispatcher) All units in the vicinity and 1-Adam-12. See the woman. A prowler there now. 3742, Juniper Road. 1-Adam-12. Code 2. Let's check the outside first. Yeah. [crickets chirping] Anything? No. Me either. Let's talk to the P.R. [doorbell ringing] (Linda) Who is it? Police. Just a minute. Someone's been trying to get in the back window upstairs. You here alone? Yes, I'm the babysitter. Okay, you stay here with them. [door opening] Did you see anybody? No. Nothing out there. But I heard him at the upstairs window. He must've climbed the tree. I carried the children down here so they'd be safe. All clear. The window's are locked on the inside. Maybe somebody got in and locked it behind him. I checked in all the rooms. There's no one up there. We'll go through the whole house with you before we leave. Couldn't you stay? Just till the Johnsons get home? He might come back. I wouldn't worry about that. If there was anyone, we've scared him away. He won't be back. Why don't we walk through the house with you, now. And you-- [rattling] (Reed) Looks like a possum. It's a raccoon. These hills are full of animals. Yeah. Friend of mine has deer come down and eat his ivy. Said he even saw a mountain lion one night. Ah, what do you wanna do about this fella? What do you mean? He's a prowler. We should take him in. I don't think it'd make a very good bust. You hungry? I'm about ready. 1-Adam-12 requesting Code 7 at Pico and Sepulveda. 1-Adam-12 continue patrol and a call. All units in vicinity and 1-Adam-12, a 459, silent. 9000 Cordova. 10-minute delay on the man. 1-Adam-12, Code 2. I'll cover the front. You check around back. Remember, if you see anything, stay put and signal me. Okay. [doorknob rattling] 1-Adam-12, requesting assistance at 9000 Cordova. What do you got, Pete? Not sure. We came in on a 459, silent. The front's secure, but Reed signaled me. He must've found some sign of entry around back. How do you wanna handle it? Brink, why don't you come with me? You can cover the back from the outside, while Reed and I go see if there's anything inside. Right. That leaves me covering the front. Yeah. Oh, and Bill, stay with the unit, huh, just in case. You can count on it. Maybe it's nothing but there is a door open up there. Let's take a look. [door creaking] [gun firing] Get the door! [panting] That was close. He had us lined up in the doorway. Malloy, you alright? Yeah, Brink, just don't open the door. What now? Now we just stay here and think a minute, that's what. 1-Adam-43. Officer needs help. 9000 Cordova. Shots fired. [whispering] I'm gonna go down and see if I can find the light switch. You stay here, keep me covered. Wouldn't it be better if I-- Look, this is a real good position. Just stay put and cover me. Got it? Got it. [gun firing] Malloy, they're heading for the front. [door rattling] Hold it! Police! 1-Adam-43. Need ambulance, 9000 Cordova. Officer's been shot. Malloy, they're trying for the side! Freeze! Hold it right there. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Stand still. Don't move a muscle. Reed, on the double. I got 'em. This all of 'em? All that's left. Cover 'em for me. Turned out to be quite a night. [sighing] I could've done without it. You and Walters both. He'll be having a ball. He'll put in two, three days getting pampered in the P and F Ward and spend the next six months talkin' about it. I guess so. [police radio chattering] Malloy? Yeah? Just one thing, did you know your gun was empty? Yeah, I knew it. Trouble was if I'd stopped to reload, I could've wound up dead. [police radio chattering] You know that stuff the Sergeant was talking about today, Officer Presence? I guess I just got the message.
