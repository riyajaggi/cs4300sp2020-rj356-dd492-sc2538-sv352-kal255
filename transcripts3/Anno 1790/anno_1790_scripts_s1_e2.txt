 Anno 1790 (2011): Season 1, Episode 2 - Den parfymerade pistolen - full transcript 
 A shop owner is found dead with a knife in his chest. A man has been caught seemingly red handed, but Daadh is not satisfied with what seems to be the obvious solution, and instead tackles the problem from a completely different angle and reaches a surprising conclusion. One of Daadh's radical friends from the old days needs his protection, but their meeting ends in tragedy that suddenly makes Daadh the focus of a vengeful woman's rage.

I've just read your advertisement... for the English soaps. Oh, yes, the English soaps. They've just arrived. Excellent for a Lady like yourself. And strong enough to remove sunburn and freckles. I shall take four bars. Thank you. We also have a new delivery of tea

 that might interest you? Tea? I fear tea is a little too daring for me. Not at all. It is an exciting drink for an adventurous Lady like yourself. But I hear that drink weakens the brain and nerves. On the contrary, it is medicinal! And the scent. Lady Ekman. Smell the scent. Is that not a scent worth dying for? Ah, Vinberg... Imagine. Tea, all the way from China. So daring of you, dear Greta. Something so exotic. It's not dangerous. I hope?

 On the contrary, my dear. It's medicinal! Shall we? I'm willing to give myself to you, Engström, as I have proved many times. And you have expressed the wish to belong to me one day. None of this will come to pass... unless I am convinced that you are able to fulfil your marital duties. As a husband. Do you understand what I'm saying? Dĺĺdh! Dĺĺdh! Dĺĺdh! An order has come from the police. There's been an incident in one of your districts. These fellows were delivering goods this morning and caught Mr. Lund, the wallpaper painter, red handed. I don't know about you but this implement says it all to me. - Is it your knife? - Yes. Are the one that killed him? He also had a sum of money on him. A tidy little sum like this isn't earned by painting leaves. Even if you're painting an entire forest! Where did the money come from? I assume you have no objections. Well, the money wasn't from here. Did you notice that smell in there? Tea? No, something else. A special smell which I cannot place. No! Jean Christian! Jean Christian! No! Let him go! Release her. Nordin. I'll taking over here. Jean Christian! Jean Christian! No! There's nothing you can do for now. Listen to me. Look at me. I wish you only well. Freund? I must make sure that Mrs. Lund makes it home properly. Commissioner! Oh. Commissioner. It's frightful. I heard what happened. And to think I just bought some tea from him only yesterday. - Yesterday? - Yes! And he said that the tea had a scent worth dying for. And now he has. Died. Is that not the queerest thing? What is happening in our city? Commissioner. I should also like to report a shooting. - A shooting? - Through my window. Last evening. That is not good. We shall have to get to the bottom of that. I shall look into it. Good. I must say, sir. That you seem at least as reliable as your predecessor. The honourable Mr. Odenstein. Farewell. Farewell Commissioner... He would never be able to murder someone. Few people would be able to do such a thing yet it still happens. Not Jean Christian. Violence is not in his nature. So why is he not protesting his innocence? Is he not? Mama! For how long had your husband been working for Vinberg? A week or so. Was he there yesterday? Yes. For how long? How long? What time did he come home? He came home... late. How late? Night-time. Was that unusual? Yes. Did your husband say anything when he came in last night? Only that he was tired. He had a nap and then left again. - To the shop? - Mm. He had to finish the painting today. That was their agreement. What is this? Tea? It's the leaf that Vinberg wanted Jean Christian to use as a template. - For the foliate bordering? - Yes. What kind of leaf is it? He was given it by Vinberg. - May I keep this? - Of course. When are you due? Soon. Your husband had a very large sum of money on him when he was arrested. A very large sum. Do you have an explanation? No. What does he say? Nothing. My friend and I were about to taste our Chinese tea when there was a sudden report and a bullet shot in through the window. It was highly alarming. And you bought the tea from Vinberg, you said. I certainly did. Earlier in the day. How did the tea taste? - Thank you. - Not like it smelt. Which I found a little peculiar. Your health. And how did it smell? Delightful. Strong. Almost like a perfume. But when we came to taste it, flat. A raw, vulgar taste. You said it was not the first time that it had happened. That a bullet has been fired in this quarter. Pistol-smith Roht cannot make his clients stop practising with their guns in private in the evenings and into the night. I've been on at him, believe you me. But he says he can do nothing about it. Don't you know. And what shall we do? I mean all us poor widows living in this house? No men? Eleonora Wide lives in the rooms above. I think that she has a lover. - Is that so? - I have even heard them at times. Oh, yes. I have seen him on the stairs many a time. Eleonora herself lives on her estate, Lehrsta, a little outside town. But several times a week she arrives in her carriage, don't you know. And stops outside by the front door at exactly 8 o'clock. And afterwards she rides back to Lehrsta at midnight. What an arrangement, n'est-ce pas? Madam Wide is a very modern woman. Do you know who this man is? Indeed I do. Engström, is his name. Major. Erik? Erik! "Here, ye children. "The instruction of a father... "and attend to kn... "to know under... "understanding. "For I give you good doctrine." Good. Miss Anna-Sophia. Very well read. Proverbs. Chapter 4. Memorise. Carl-August... Freund! How nice to see you back to normal. Have you and Dĺĺdh settled into the district commissioner's quarters? Yes, we have thank you. I heard about Mr Vinberg. Do we know who could have done it? Everything points to Mr. Lund, the wallpaper painter, but I'm not sure that Dĺĺdh is of the same opinion. Fetch some linen. It's in the cupboard out there. And brandy. It's in Freund's chamber. - In the chamber-pot cabinet. - The chamber-pot cabinet? The little that might be left of it is, anyway. You do realise we're finished if they find you here? Your sister too. The newspaper said you'd been hunted down and shot. That you then drowned in the Walsta river. All of you. I was in the river. But dived under when I was hit. I didn't surface until I'd been dragged a long way downstream. Cathrin Sällberg? She didn't manage to get away. They dragged her up onto land. Then she screamed out her dead son's name. They fired shot after shot after shot until she fell silent. Why did you come back to Stockholm? Von Graz told me who he thought had betrayed us. Who? You're no longer one of us. Dĺĺdh. I cannot tell you that. - Was that all there was? - Yes. This will be painful. Even for a thick-skinned revolutionary like yourself. Freund? No. Dĺĺdh? Are you here? Excuse me, the door was unlocked. - I was just on my way out. - I hope we are not disturbing you. Not at all. It is but a pleasure! Odenstein's chambermaid complained for years about the lack of linen here. So I asked Johanna to collect what we had over. That is too kind of you. Have you no linen at all here? What we have is on our beds. Freund says that you doubt that you have found Vinberg's murderer. I must examine the matter a little further. - Anyway. - You have blood on your shirt. I have been operating. Operating? A person without means needed my assistance an hour or so ago. I should get changed. So you do operations? Amongst the poor? Then we shan't disturb you any more. I might as well be honest with you. I had to perform the operation here. - Here? - The patient has no permanent home. So I was compelled to bring him here to give him the care he needed. What is his... injury? He has been badly... bitten by a dog. My Lady... I realise that these rooms are not suited to the care of the poor. But I was forced to make an exception this time. It will not happen again. My Lady. There is nothing to see in there... You are a true philanthropist, Dĺĺdh. Until we meet again... I shall look forward to it. He is a wanted anti-royalist conspirator. What would you that I should do? Throw him out? - He is a revolutionary. A murderer. - Is he? Who knows. See him as resurrected. Freund. You read yourself of his death in the newspaper. His sister has promised to arrange a new place. Meanwhile, he stays here. Where's my brandy? I now know what it was that we smelt in the shop. Musk. Lady Wahlstedt wears a perfume with the same scent. This leaf that Vinberg gave wallpaper painter Lund to copy comes from China. From the same mountains as the musk deer "from the scrotum of which "small valuable grains are extracted "for use in making perfumes." What does this have to do with Vinberg's murder? Would it not have been more natural for a trader in tea to have a tea-leaf painted? I also asked a question, Dĺĺdh. Where is my brandy? Good night. Freund. How late is it? It's gone midnight. Where's Märta? She'll be back tomorrow. We might try to move you when she gets here. It was a close call back then. With the police chiefs wife. You heard? Bitten by a dog! What could I say? You seem a little sweet on her. Have you already lost your way amongst the gentry? Dinners. Fine linen on the beds and tables. I too have a forbidden love. "Liberté,. "Égalité... "... Fraternité." Liberty. Equality... - Fraternity. - I was given it by a French brother. You have not abandoned your ideas of a rational society already. I hope. Dĺĺdh? I just don't think it can be achieved through violence or open warfare. I more believe in... enlightenment, teaching, education... People with power will not relinquish it through persuasion. You are naive. Freund. Peas and bacon. By orders of Dĺĺdh. And where is the District Commissioner himself? On a job. Lieutenant sir. We're not in the field. Freund. You don't have to be quite so... Call me if there's anything else. It wasn't the wallpaper knife that killed Vinberg. There was too little blood around the wound. He was probably already dead when the knife went in. The wallpaper painter is not denying murder. He's not admitting it, either. What are you looking for? Can you not smell it? That smell... What's this? What does it look like? It's a splinter of walnut wood. So it probably... comes from the butt of a pistol. Vinberg had a skull injury. So you mean Vinberg died from a blow? A blow hard enough to splinter the butt of a pistol. This is where he hid it. It was musk that Vinberg pinned his fortune on. Not tea. Where are you going? To see Jean Christian Lund. - You'll have to talk to me first. - I have to ask him some questions. It's hardly your job to obstruct my work. Nordin. I am chief jailer, as you well know. Which means? That I wish to know the purpose of your visit. I'm not sure he was the one who did it. He's admitted it was his knife. But not that it was he who held it. Again, you give weight to wrong things. If you continue in this manner. Our cooperation will be everything but pleasant. I just require a moment. Do you know what leaf this is? I'm a painter, not a botanist. I'll be straight. I don't think Vinberg died from a stab wound from a wallpaper knife but from a hard blow to the skull. Do you own a pistol? No. Did someone else strike him? An accomplice? You must know something. Your wife told me you were in the shop the previous evening... Dĺĺdh. - The Chief of Police wants a word. - Tell him... I shouldn't keep the Chief of Police waiting if I were you. Lund was found beside a clearly murdered Vinberg. He admits it was his knife that was stuck in his chest, and... he does not protest his innocence. - Why? - I do not know. Well then. Drop the matter and concentrate on those for which we yet have no answers. Such as the shooting against the Widows' Home. - Have you investigated that? - No. Then do so. Dĺĺdh! My Lady. I am not really in the mood. I can see that. What has happened? Your husband... - Come. - My Lady...? Tell me. Your husband gives me impossible orders. That is why we need people like you here. My Lady? The wallpaper painter is probably innocent. Yet he orders me to drop the case in favour of the shooting... We have ordinances and statutes and they include chastisement. So what? Dear God, a little slap round the ear is good for you... But that is why you are here. Dĺĺdh. Do you not see that? Do as ordered. Investigate the shooting against the Widows' Home. But do not drop the wallpaper paints-Vs case. If you do the two things at once you can achieve that which you wish for. Justice. For the ones who need it most. Miss Raxelius! Miss Raxelius! No one is prepared to give Erik shelter. It's too dangerous. What shall I do? I shall look after him. He can stay with me until he has recovered. Thank you. Thank you. I knew I could trust you. Go to him. I shall be along later. I've checked the lists. That Engström is not a major. No, not any more. He was dismissed from the Kalmar regiment for loose living and general cowardice. What is a fine Lady like Madam Wide doing with a man like that? Different things bind men and women together. Freund. Or rather, that bind people together. Have you bought some new brandy? Thank you. But that Madam Wide never arrived? No. She doesn't come every night. Apparently. It's immoral, all of it. For a woman, you mean? No. Dĺĺdh. Sitting there with your spyglass. What did you hope to see? Dealings? Dealings? It's their business. I didn't think earthly love was something that interested you. I still don't see why Wahlstedt is so keen for me to look into the shooting against the Widows' Home. A shot that harmed no one. It's apparently happened before. Instead of finding out the truth about a murder. It makes no sense. There's something I'm not being told. Jean Christian Lund risks being wrongly hanged at the same time as his fourth child is born. And Wahlstedt seems not to care less. I intend to defy Wahlstedt's orders. I know who fired the shot at the Widows' Home. What? I happened to overhear a conversation earlier. Who fired the shot? It was one of us. That's all I can tell you. Why fire at the Widows' Home? Concentrate on freeing that wallpaper painter. Before the king's men make even more children fatherless. Come on, up you get! Out! Talk to me. Lund. If not for your sake. For that of your wife and children. Do you wish to die? Is that what you wish? Guard! I just went there that evening to collect some designs. It was nothing. I shall stay. Continue. I'd realised that Vinberg was up to something that he wanted to... keep secret. He'd sit at his desk busying himself with something I knew not what. But every time. A scent would spread in the room. A scent I couldn't trace to anything special. That last evening. I arrived to collect some designs for the morning's work... When I entered the shop I saw someone... squatting down by a trapdoor removing some little red boxes from under the floor. Vinberg was lying there beside him. He threatened to kill me. I told him I had a wife... and three children. A fourth on the way... He said in that case I'd need some extra money. He kicked one of the red boxes over to me. He then said he knew where I lived and that he'd kill my wife and children if he ever found out that I'd told the police what I'd seen. He then ordered me away. I was so shaken after the event that I couldn't face going home. A man asked me where I'd got that box from. I told him I couldn't say. He said he was sure it was musk. And that it was worth a fortune. And when he told me what those little grains could be worth. I thought he was joking. So you sold the musk that same night? That's how you got the money. I knew it was wrong. I regretted the whole thing, even by the next morning. But you went back anyway. Back to the shop. Yes. When I arrived at the shop I saw my own wallpaper knife sticking out of Vinberg's breast. But instead of pulling it out I thought I'd see if there were any boxes left. And then when I pulled the knife out. That's when they caught me. The god of avarice had possessed me. I shall never forgive myself. I can do no more than people ask of me. Can you be quiet? I am here to ask if you have been given a pistol with a split butt recently. From which this might have come. Not that many. I'm afraid. I can look. It would be these two, then. No... Who handed this in to you? I think it was a captain... No. A major. Anders Engström. The report about the accidental shots? - I shall overlook it this time. - Thank you. For the present. Open up! Open up! Anders Engström? You are under arrest for the murder of Sven Vinberg, the shopkeeper. Engström... Engström! Your vomit stinks of musk. Take your men and see if you can find anything in the kitchen. The privy or wardrobe. Come on, then. I understand that you have been having an affair with the Mrs Wide. The judge's widow, for some time. Yes. A rewarding one? Yes. What were you hoping for? Marriage? Why not? Because of inadequate performance? In the bed there. Did you hope that the musk would help you? But you couldn't afford it so you were compelled to kill Vinberg? For the sake of your honour? I also know that your pistol was the murder weapon. What I don't understand is why you left his petty cash. You are not a rich man. Nor a thief. No? How did you know that Vinberg sold musk? - I'd heard rumours. - About? That Vinberg was buying tea. Scent-contaminated tea... that was shipped in the same hold as a batch of musk by mistake. Vinberg bought the musk as well. But he refused to admit that this was true. He was also reluctant to sell anything to me as I was already in debt to his business. So he asked me to leave. And then I started to think of Eleonora and all the humiliation I felt. The musk was my only chance. So I turned back. I was in luck. I saw where he was hiding it. But I didn't dare shoot him. I've never liked guns. Continue... Then the wallpaper painter arrived. - To fetch his designs? - No idea. You threatened him. Then bought his silence with one box of musk grains. And by way of thanks you stuck Lund's wallpaper knife in Vinberg. To pin the blame on him. I didn't mean Vinberg to die. He just shouldn't have denied me what I needed. Engström... I do not understand... How in God's name did you think that musk would help you wed the widow? By the power of the scent? Musk is also an aphrodisiac. Nordin. I see, it's like that... A means by which one may enhance and guarantee one's sexual drive. How much musk did you take? Well... all of it, apparently. My God. You have swallowed a fortune. And turned it all into shit! Anna-Maria... here's the new Commissioner I told you about. Miss Rudling... Where is Major Engström being taken? It's a long story. Here she comes... What's happened? Nordin! Get down! Down! Erik? Listen to me. Erik. Justice has caught up with Engström. He will be punished. And so your fallen fellows-at-arms will gain redress. Go. Go now! This is your pistol. My Pistol? Erik... Onward, men! The West Slope! Over there, men! Over there! Aren't you listening to me? It wasn't me who shot him. The word around town says otherwise. Everyone's calling you a hero. A dubious one if you ask me. - Where's all this linen from? - Freund... Sheltering him is one thing. Shooting him is quite another. Now you listen to me! I did not shoot him! - He shot himself! - Himself? With your pistol? He realised he was going to die. He shot himself and gave me the pistol. He saved me. Freund. You too. Me? How would you explain to Wahlstedt that Raxelius was caught holding my pistol? You, who's so bad at lying. Do you remember you once said that you must be able to trust me? You have withheld the truth from me once before. Can I trust you this time? Yes. Did you pull the trigger? No. On your feet! Your wife is due to give birth. May I go? Just make sure you're back first thing tomorrow. The theft charges remain. Thank you. Nordin. Don't mention it. I thought I'd change the bed linen. Let me do it. Good night. Good night. My congratulations. Dĺĺdh. For finding the guilty party. Thank you. Anders Engström. What can you tell me about him? I think you know more about him than I. Is that so? It was Anders Engström's window Raxelius was aiming at when he shot at the Widows' Home. He missed. Because his arm was weak and hit the widow Ekman's window in the floor below. And why should Raxelius have wanted to harm Engström? My conclusion is that it was Engström who gave you and the police the vital information that enabled you to subdue von Graz and his conspirators. And how had Raxelius known that Engström was one of my informers? I don't know. I can tell you now that Engström's expected death sentence will be commuted to exile. By order. Of whom? Let me present Judge Wide's widow. Eleonora Wide. One of the police authority's most reliable informers. And a personal friend of the King himself. The widow Wide's importance to national security... You saved my life the other evening. Commissioner Dĺĺdh. Without you, the rebel Raxelius's bullet would no doubt have ended my life. I wish to thank you. On behalf of myself... and... as I already have a dispatch on... of the King. Everyone is talking of your resourcefulness. My husband tells me that you personally ended the conspirator's life. It was my duty. - It must have been hard for you. - I had no choice. How shall we know what is right to do. And what is not? Dĺĺdh... That man you were tending to. The one bitten by the dog. How is he? Thank you... He is suffering no more.
