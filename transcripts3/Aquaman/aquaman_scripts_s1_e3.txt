We will sink into the sea. Get to the blast-off controls. Quickly. Quickly! Pull, troops! Pull hard! Release us, Earthlings, or we will destroy you with our rocket blasts. No. [groaning] Return our sea creatures or we'll pull you into the sea. Quickly, give me the dehydrated Earth creatures! Thanks. Now, if you'll send down your tube you can have your monster back. Let's go, gang. [creaking] Sufferin' sea cows! Look at that. [yelping] (Aqualad) Glad to have you back, Tusky boy. There goes the monster. roar Quickly, blast off! Hurry! Out of the way. They're going to blast off. [swooshing] kaboom [neighing] Easy, fellas. Relax. Yes, it's all over now. Let's head for home. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] (male narrator)  In just a moment, we'll return with another exciting adventure featuring a guest star from the galaxy  of super superhero. The Justice League of America. The combined might and power  of the Man of Steel and the Cosmic Crusader. The Winged Avenger  and the King of the Sea. The Tiny Titan  and the Scarlet Streak. All working together  for good against evil as...the Justice  League of America. boom (male narrator)  In his office  at the "Daily Planet" Clark Kent receives  a startling telephone call. (man on phone) 'Clark Kent, I know you are Superman.' Who is this? 'Meet me at the top' 'of Black Mountain immediately' 'or I will expose you to the world.' In swift succession,  four other members of the Justice League received  similar telephone threats. Interplanetary space scientist,  Carter Hall alias Hawkman. Police lab technician,  Barry Allen alias the Flash. Atomic science professor,  Ray Palmer, alias the Atom. Test pilot, Hal Jordan,  alias Green Lantern. Within minutes,  five colorfully costumed Justice Leaguers convene  on top of Black Mountain. Anybody know who's the joker who knows our secret identities? - Beats me. - Me too. - Likewise. - There's your answer. I am Master Mind and I have lured you superheroes from your posts, so that you will not interfere with my master plot to take over your planet. 'A plot which is now in operation. Look.' 'Earth's largest rocket at Cape Grant' 'is at this moment being subjected' 'to my ultrasonic convergent beams' 'which will explode it and the entire rocket base.' Great galaxy! (Master Mind) 'Now, see the water' 'surrounding the city of Metropolis' 'burst into flame which will destroy it.' [Master Mind laughing] 'Missiles, each speeding' 'to a pre-programmed Earth target.' If you try to stop those attacks members of the Justice League, you will be destroyed. That's what you think, Master Mind. Up and away! [swooshing] kaboom That's one. [laughing] With four to go. kaboom I'll take care of the missiles. Atom and I'll go for the rocket base. I'll put out the fire. Then we'll find Superman together. [instrumental music] Where, where am I? You are on an uncharted asteroid, Superman. For I have spent years perfecting my master plot. - You wasted your time. - I think not, Superman. Oh. Ah. Kryptonite. [laughing] Within hours, the concentrated intensity of the Kryptonite radiation will rob you of all your super powers completely and forever. [laughing] Strength going. pew swoosh - Here it is. - And away we go. swoosh Holy cow! I'm-I'm stuck! Quicksilver in quicksand! Don't move! Thrust me on that machine before the rocket base goes up. Hurry! [dramatic music] [sizzling] Free! Now, gotta get the Atom out of there. (Flash) 'Let's go, mighty might.' [sizzling] boom You shall pay with your lives for this. (male narrator)  At this moment, Hawkman  in his swift Hawkship intercepts Master Mind's  guided missiles. That's that. Now to see how Green Lantern's doing. [crackling] Only one way to put out that fire. An explosion to create a vacuum. But first I must shield the city from the shock waves. [crackling continues] Hawkman. Just in time to help. Come on, Hawkman, hit the fire zone with the biggest blasts in your arsenal. Big blasts coming up. pew pew pew boom Fire's out. Now we've got to find Superman. My radiotron has located him on a small asteroid. Let's go. (Master Mind) 'Superman is a goner.' Flash and the Atom are trapped. 'And here come the other two.' Now I can take off and enjoy their destruction from a safe distance. [laughing] [swooshing] - Look! - Get us out of here. - How did you two get here? - We were teleported. - Same as Superman. - Where's he? My radar vision shows him under this floor in a room filled with kryptonite. We've gotta get him out, fast. (Master Mind) 'Yes, and when you lift the trapdoor' you will trip a booby trap that will create a galactic cataclysm. Stand away. I'll hit it with my power beam. (Hawkman) No! Don't! My radar vision shows a detonating device attached to the trapdoor. - What could we do? - Leave it to me. Got to take it easy. (Atom) 'Slowly.. '...there!' All clear. Fire away, GL. [zapping] Come on. Let's get him out of there. You've not defeat me yet, Justice League. If I can't rule Earth, I'll destroy it! (male narrator) From his spaceship,  Master Mind sends the asteroid itself in motion into a direct  collision course with Earth. Hop aboard the Hawkship, fellas, and blast off. I'll take care of the asteroid and Master Mind. Up, up and away! [swooshing] (male narrator)  With a mighty jolt,  the Man of Steel crashes into the asteroid  and deflects its course away from Earth. It's heading right for me! No! boom That does it, Justice Leaguers. Now back to Earth. 'Away!' (male narrator)  Coming up next,  more action-packed adventures with Aquaman,  King of the Seven Seas featuring Aqualad  and Tusky the walrus. [neighing] Not far from the shimmering  dome of Atlantis as flame-haired Mera  and Tusky the walrus near a circle of silvery sand a strange stalk pushes up. And a single beautiful flower  opens gleaming petals. Ah! (male narrator)  Moments later, in the Aquacave Aquaman, King of the Seven Seas and his teenage ally, Aqualad hear a familiar sound. - Tusky! - What's up, boy? [yelping] Where's Mera? Wasn't she with you? She must be in big trouble. Let's go, Tadpole. [dramatic music] I think Tusky's trying to tell us Mera vanished at this spot. She couldn't have just gone down through the seafloor. - 'Look!' - 'It..' (Aqualad) 'It's some kind of screen or a warp.' (Aquaman) 'Check. A warp we're going to pass through right now.' Come on. [gurgling] [yelping] splash splash (Aqualad) 'Mumblin' mantis!' Another waterworld beneath ours. Creepy place. I never dreamed it existed. 'But some of our fish found their way down here.' Holy haddock! Look at that! (Aquaman) 'Maybe Mera's in there. Come on.' - They're alive! - Break through. (male narrator)  Trapped, unable to move Aquaman issues a telepathic  command for help. [beeping] Here come the thresher sharks. Let's go, team! [gurgling] (male narrator)  Meanwhile, on the warp's  other side the faithful sea horses,  Storm and Imp, wait nervously. Storm, worried,  decides to follow. splash splash At this moment, in a huge room within the other waterworld.. (Aqualad) 'Hoppin' toadfish, Aquaman! That's Mera!' Under some weird ray. (Aquaman) 'We've gotta get her out of here.' (male #1) 'Halt, intruders!' What? Who? Who was that? Look there, Aqualad. You look up at Slam the ruler of this waterworld and its plant beings. Who are you? I am Aquaman, king of the upper waterworld. If you don't release that girl, we will-- You will, what? [laughing] Leapin' lionfish! Where'd they come from? (Aquaman) 'Move, Tadpole.' I can't move. [grunting] Fight, Aqualad! Fight! [intense music] Place the young one under the convergent ray. 'He too shall be turned into a plant being' 'to serve Slam.' [laughing continues] 'Take him to the pit.' [yelping] [laughing] 'Aquaman, your doom is assured.' 'You shall be destroyed by the Hydra.' [screeching] Can't avoid.. ...other two heads forever. I need help. (male narrator)  Again, from the brain  of the Sea King a telepathic message  reaches out. swoosh [thwacking] [grunting] [grunting] Too heavy even for me. 'Storm, Imp, come here.' Now, pull hard! 'Harder!' [creaking] [screeching] (Aquaman) Uh-oh, the Hydra. This ought to hold it. clang Now, to get Aqualad and Mera. [dramatic music] I'll take over, Tusky. splash Aquaman. He's escaped. Stop them! Tusky, you and the horses take Aqualad and Mera back. And send more help. Destroy him! (male narrator)  As the dazed Sea King  is seized by the Plantman a battalion of loyal fish  sent by Tusky come charging to his aid. [instrumental music] Back off, troops. I'll finish this. (male narrator)  Whirling at fantastic speed,  Aquaman creates a terrific underwater storm. Hope that holds them until I can reach my own ocean. She'll be alright. But I'm worried about.. Aquaman! splash Greetings, team. Wait. There's just one more thing I must do. [beeping] creak What is that for? Just in case Slam ever decides to invade our seas 'those big, sharp jaws will make him think twice.' Right, Tadpole? Check, big daddy. [yelping] Now, let's get Mera back for a good rest in Atlantis. [theme music] [music continues]
