 Carnivàle (2003–2005): Season 1, Episode 2 - After the Ball Is Over - full transcript 
 A practical joke which has him clean an old dirty trailer leads Ben to a piece of the puzzle of his past - a tuxedo-clad man named Scudder who Ben keeps seeing in his dreams and who may be his long-lost father. Meanwhile, Brother Justin and his sister Iris have a conversation with Justin's mentor, Reverend Norman Balthus, which makes him realize that he has a gift that he must put to use. With the help of a vision that comes to him at the right time, he persuades the owner of the local brothel Mr. Chin's to allow him to turn it into a house of worship for the local migrants. At the Carnivale, Sofie continues to tend to her comatose, telepathic mother, Apollonia, after their upsetting run in with Ben, whose powers can help, or harm.

 Every prophet in his house. lt sure is hot. lt's hard enough to stay clean here with all this dust and dirt and whatnot. l am so damn tired of waking up with grit in my teeth every morning. How old are you, farm boy? - Old enough. - Got any jills back home? A couple. Easy. l ain't going to hurt you. l was just trying to help. l don't need your help. l guess farm-boy ain't used to gals like us, Lib.

 No, Ma, didn't you hear? - He's got a whole bunch of gals back home. - A whole herd, l bet. Y'all don't know me. You don't know nothing about me. l know l saw you staring at my titties in the show. Practically hypnotised. But that's OK, honey. That's what they're there for. l seen better. l just think you see what you want to see. Things are bad. People get desperate. Please. Forget it. He's not coming back here. Not after last time. Mother, l tried. Yes.

 l'll ask him. l said yes. Spider, Billy, l want you two on Colossus. Valves haven't seated on that rebuild. Run her for an hour and get her hot, drain the oil. lf you find shavings, give me a holler. Grover, Cap, spike the cootch tent. You too, Jake. And check for holes round back. - Sew them up tight. - Right, boss. l'm tired of them hayseeds getting a free show. - Hawkins! - Yeah? - You're in charge of the baggage trailer. - The what? The baggage trailer. Round back. Run-down trailer with a big old roof rack on her. Can't miss it. - What do you want me to do? - Go through it, save anything worth saving. Dump the rest. When you're done, give it a good sweep. Get to work. Jesus. Hell. Hey, boy, where you been hiding yourself? They're spiking the ten-in-one. l was cleaning out the baggage trailer. Baggage trailer? - Jonesy. - Yeah, boss? Did you tell this boy to clean out the baggage trailer? We was just having some fun. l don't pay you birds to have fun. We're an hour behind already. Get on over there, and help them spike the tent. So l should finish the baggage trailer later? He still wants to... We got no baggage trailer. Nobody's got a baggage trailer. lt's an old carny gag, like hunting for snipe. Send some fool searching for something that don't exist. - But l was in there. - Where? The baggage trailer, goddamnit! OK, sport. Suppose you show me where it is. - Forget it, kid. - No, it happened, goddamnit. l'm telling you, l was cleaning out old trunks. Look. Here, l found this. - Where? - ln the trailer that ain't there. - You know who that is? - Nope. You? Something l found. - You don't mind if l hang on to it? - Yeah, l do mind. Suit yourself. What in the hell are you up to? Don't stare. Brother Justin, you and your sister were truly inspiring today. - Thank you, Eleanor. - Let me introduce you to my family. - This is my sons, Tom and Lester. - Good to finally meet you. - Did you enjoy the service, Lester? - Parts. Don't pay him no mind. This is my niece, Maggie, and her husband, Garrett. - Hello, Reverend. - Hello. - Who is this? - This is Harold, JJ and Molly and Dorothy and Tim and Lyle. Brother Justin's put your grandma on the righteous path. Bless you, sister. - Thank you. - Excuse me, folks. - Carroll. Mrs Templeton. - Reverend. Watch your step. Getting crowded in there these days. Yes, it certainly is. Splendid, isn't it? Yes, splendid. l was thinking of stopping by this afternoon. Have a little chat. Always a pleasure. This afternoon, then? Reverend. lris. Mr Templeton. Reverend. Hello. - Dear Lord. - What? Felix, look at what your daughter's eating. That is a pig's portion. Split that with your daddy. But Ma, l'm hungry. Just leave the girl alone. You'll look like a lumberjack and nobody wants to see a lumberjack dance the cootch. l'd like to see a lumberjack dance the cootch. Just spoke to the local constabulary. We are fixed in this town. As in, heavily. - Great. Babe get that homer yet? - Still sitting around 699. He had a couple of hits against the Red Sox. Drove in the winning run with a long fly ball. Crowd roared. No home run. Gonna be quite a thing when it happens, ain't it? Yeah, hell of a thing. Mind? 700, can you imagine that? No one is ever going to beat that. - Babe Ruth is going to... - Babe Ruth is overrated, he never did nobody a bit of good but himself. Jeezo! Bite my head off. They got you fixed up with a job yet? Been towing junk off trucks, helping to set up tents, lights. Roustie. " Roustabout" - that's what they call a guy who does what you do. - Roustabout. - Reckon that's what l am, then. They're starting you at the bottom. - That's where everyone starts. - Honey, over here. You know, l could talk to Samson for you. He likes me. Maybe get you fixed up with a better job. A flasher, talker or something. l ain't much for talking. Do you sense any attraction between them? Maybe on her part. Boy doesn't know what to do with a woman. Needs someone to show him the ropes. Someone with experience. That would be unwise. What's wrong with teaching a puppy a few tricks? For one, it might very well kill you. At least l'd die with a smile on my face. No. l don't think so. Maybe you could come by tonight. No... lt's my mother. She wants to see you again. No offence but... your ma, she gives me the creeping willies. Things wind down about midnight. Please? She won't leave me alone. She's driving me crazy. Your ma's a turnip. That Betty has been a real pill about collecting blankets for the migrants. She said she was going to put it on the agenda of the Women's Auxiliary but so far... the only thing she has done is to give me a bunch of excuses. Justin Crowe, you have not heard a word that l've said. - ls that a new dress? - No, it's not a new dress. Something wrong? Excuse me. Children. - Tardy as usual. - l'm sorry we're late. - lt's so good to see you. - Did you see the car? - You didn't . - l did, just outside. The Buick Phaeton. Silver and black. Runs like a greyhound. Salinas to Mintern in just over an hour. - You're lucky you didn't crash. - Did l mention it's a convertible? Tea, please. - Every prophet in his house. - Excuse me? l said, coming right up. - Norman, a man your age... - Should enjoy the blessings the good Lord bestows on him while there is still time. You're turning into a rake. Justin, you better snap this little girl back into line. - l'm sorry? - Your sister just called me a rake. He's been like this all week. - Something bothering you, son? - l just have a lot on my mind. Well then, maybe this will make you stand up and salute. No more Babe Ruth, please! That's all anybody talks about. Of course it is. Mighty endeavours are inspiring. There's nothing inspiring about a man hitting a ball with a stick. l could say the same about a young man throwing rocks with a sling. Norman Balthus, don't you dare compare David to Babe Ruth! You just watch me, little girl. ln desperate times... the good Lord looks over the flock and chooses one man to inspire the multitudes, one man to accomplish the impossible, one man to offer hope where there was only hopelessness. And who are we to judge the wisdom of the Almighty? He chooses His servants to fit His plan and when He chooses His servant from among the flock and gifts them with talents it is a grave sin to bury them in the earth. Amen. Who shall Lady Luck smile upon now? Nickel wins a sawbuck. A sawbuck wins a fiver. Fortune is only one spin away. You, sir, you look like a winner! Step right up. Just feast your eyes on this Northern ltalian beauty. This is the woman all the men in town been talking about. She's gonna shake it. She's gonna break it. She's gonna tear it down to the ground because Miss Francesca here is so hot she's gonna put blisters on your eyeballs. The cards are unclear. l'm sorry. ls that bad? Come on. So you're gonna be a child. Well, we've gotta eat. Don't try to change the subject. The point is, l already asked him. He said no, that's the end of it. Yes, it is. Folks, we're closed. Sorry. - What do you want? - Nothing. Boy! Hey, boy! - l need a quick hand. - Yeah? - Run and fetch Gabriel's gauntlets. - What? Them big leather straps he wears around his wrists. He won't go on without them. l gotta stall. - Where they at? - Third trailer on this side. On my vanity. Near the back by the bed. Now, skedaddle! - Bless you. - Sorry it took so long. Mr Templeton. Please come on in. Justin, Mr Templeton's here. Hello, Carroll. l was afraid you wouldn't come by. Of course l came. Said l would, didn't l? Yes, you certainly did. Please have a seat. lris, how about some of that cold lemonade? Well... l have a project in the works that l'm very excited about but l'm going to need your help. l had a feeling you were gonna say that. What kind of project? You remember you said it was crowded in church? Yeah. As a matter of fact that's why l'm here... l know. lt's the migrants. They need a place to worship, but our church is already overcrowded. So what they need is a place of their own. See, l was just saying something like that to Emma not an hour ago. - ls that right? - Yes, sir. How can l help you, Reverend? There's a building on State Street. l believe you own it. - Chin's ? - That's the one. l want you to give that to me. l'm sorry. Did l...? - Did l say something funny? - Yeah. That's a real howler. Turning Chin's into a church for the Okies? l'm quite serious. l'm sure you are. l'll tell you what, would $50 work? - They can get a nice tent... - No. The Lord has spoken to me. He was quite clear. l want Chin's . - The Lord has spoken to you? - That's correct. Maybe he should have told you it's not for sale. - Are you mocking me, Mr Templeton? - l'm just saying it's not for sale. - And l have no intention of buying it. - No? - You will donate it. - To you? With all due respect, you're out of your goddamn mind. How dare you take the Lord's name in vain in this house! Hello, Mr Templeton. Back so soon? My sweet Jesus. This your piece for the week plus rent. Anything new on the menu? Maybe. Room four. Upstairs. Enjoy. - Let me go. - What's on the menu, Carroll? What's the matter, Templeton? Don't tell me you're not hungry. Look at you. You're famished! Hello. Open your eyes. Face your sin! Here we go. Some nice, cool lemonade. - Thank you, lris. - You're welcome. Right this way, folks. We're shutting down. Good night now. Right this way. Thanks for coming. - Let me give you a hand with that. - No, l got it. - Ain't seen you around much. - l've been around. Yeah, l know. l just ain't seen you. Something on your mind? l was thinking, l never did teach you how to throw a slider. Yeah, you did. l was 1 1 . 1 1? Damn. lt's been a dog's age since we played catch. l gotta wash Momma's hair. Yeah. No, l know. l mean, l didn't mean now. lt's dark, right? Still got your mitt? - Jonesy... - Yeah. Poor Jonesy. Sniffing around little Miss Prissy Pants like a dog lost his bone. l'd wager he knows where his bone is, all right. Bet you wouldn't mind helping him find it. Jonesy? No, not my type. Besides, he'd sooner lick dust than kneel at the altar. Gotta admit he is wicked handsome, though. For a roustie maybe. Me, l'd fancy a toss with the debutante. l wouldn't mind blowing her safe. - Well, listen to you, Clark Gable. - Yeah. The boy's a remarkable find. Should prove quite valuable, no? Hell, Lodz. He's a rube. And yet, Management wants him on full-time, no? For now. l saw Scudder... in the boy's dreams. Don't care. Scudder's dead. Has been for years. On the contrary. Scudder's alive and well. Hogwash. But you will tell Management, won't you? l'd do it myself, but he won't listen to me any more. He used to... but ever since St Louis... Things have changed since St Louis. No. Samson...we should head south. Circuit takes us north. The circuit's just an excuse. You know that. We're heading north. Thanks for the whiskey. All right, boys, we're down for the night. Get some shut-eye. - See you all in the morning. - All right, Jonesy. We were always stronger together than apart. All you have to do is let me in. - What are you doing here? - Just having a chat. Get the hell out! My intentions exactly. You leave me no choice, my dear. But then, you know that. Mama, are you all right? That's it! l've had enough of your tantrums! You're the one. Mama! Over here! Sofie, she's over here! What the hell are you doing? Get away from her. Get your hands off her. Don't touch her! Everybody, stay back. Sofie, she OK? What the hell's going on here? l don't know. Mama, can you hear me? Say something! Spill it, Hawkins. What happened here? What did you do to her? l was sleeping. l woke up. She walked over to me. She can't walk. She can't even move, everybody knows that. l didn't do nothing to her, Sofie. You gotta believe me, l didn't do... - Mama, can you hear me? - Let me go, goddamnit! Don't worry. lt's OK, it's all right. Let the boy go. Gabriel, stop. Calm down. Everyone just quiet down. l said, let him go. Boss, we got a problem here. Needs sorting out. We don't have no sorting out to do. The kid didn't do nothing wrong. Cut him loose. l can't hear her. She ain't talking to me. What's wrong with her? l don't know, sweetheart. l really don't . Sorry. Best we get her inside, though. Come on, give her a hand here, for Christ's sake! You got her? All right. Stand back, everyone. Gentle. There's been a change of plans. Tomorrow, we pack it up, head south. South? Let's get some sleep. Crack of dawn, children. - You OK? - l'm fine. Let me take a gander. We gotta get something on that jaw. Come on. l said, come on. You want to tell me what's going on? Things are changing. Not for the better. South? Gonna be hotter than Hades down there. That it will. Hold still. There. Leave that on through the night. Take the swelling down by morning. Let's see about those ribs. Hope you don't truck no grudge against Gabe. He was just looking out for Appy is all. l didn't touch her. l know. Thank you. This mean anything to you? l remember that. Where'd you get it? l found it. This here is a picture of old Hack Scudder's sweetie. What was her name? Flora. - You met her? - No, never met her. Hack showed me the picture. Used to go on and on. Poor old Hack. That's him. Worked the geek show. Real rummy. Poor bastard never met a bottle he didn't like. Sad thing. He sure seemed to miss this woman. Don't know what happened between them. All's l know, he always kept the picture on him. She's my ma. The lady we buried back in Milfay? Well, now... That is downright queer. You mind if l keep this? This Scudder, do you think he might've been in the war? Could've been. Lots of crazy men in the war. Crazy as mud bugs on a griddle. Gabriel, come on inside now. Brothers and sisters, welcome to our new temple, our new home, our sanctuary. Here it is we will begin our holy task... our mission... to bring in the multitudes who are now lost to God. The multitudes who would otherwise perish forever... when his sword is loosed upon the world. - Get out, or l'll call the police. - Go ahead. Hello, operator? Oh, no. Yes. You see, l cut the line with this knife. The same knife l used to kill that nosy old bag next door. - lt was you. - Yes, and once she was dead l only had to leave behind some incriminating evidence. Joe's wallet? l picked his pocket on the train platform. The fool had his nose... - l saved you some supper. - l'm not hungry. A long day? We have a new church. We do? Chin's . That gambling hall in Chinatown? Brother Templeton donated it to our new ministry. For the migrants. - The migrants? - The flock l've been chosen to lead. Chosen by the Lord God. He spoke to me, lris. And l shall carry out His will. Praise the Lord. Amen. You're a good man, Justin. He's chosen such a good man. After the break of morn After the dancer's leaving After the stars are gone Many a heart is aching lf you could read them all Many the hopes that have vanished After the ball Many the hopes that have vanished After the ball English
