I'm looking for someone. My pa. He's out this way somewhere. If I met my father, I'd kill him dead. He raped my ma. That's why she hates me. She didn't hate you, Sof. How could anybody hate you? What the hell? Jones, god damn it! What the--? Shit Christmas. What happened? Them sons of bitches torched us out. Who? Fucking Daily Brothers. Rat-fucks burned the place down for the insurance, sure as hell. Is that Samson? Charlie Lewis! - Yes, sir. - Hey! Long time. Long time. Where's everyone else? Most of them scattered out. Rest of us ain't got but a few busted trucks and maybe $13 in change between us. Damn if it ain't a lucky thing you come by. I'm gonna see what's going on. - You coming? - No, I'll wait. Let's go. I want to set up a circle right around over there. Get some sidewalls off the hickman. Set up a tent over there, all right? Watch the potholes! Let's go, come on. Come on now!

Just keep going? We've got a code! You okay? Sweetie? Are you lost? "Every prophet in her house!" Mother. Are you all there? We're pitching camp here. What happened? A fire. Did anybody die? No. Not a one. They was all real lucky. You might be more comfortable in your trailer. I'd rather stay here. I should go help out or Jones will skin me. Are you sure you're all right? You're shaky. I'll be fine. Make haste, dear Lord, to deliver me. Make haste to help me, my dearest God. Let them be ashamed and confounded, those who seek to take my soul. Let them be turned backward into confusion, those that desire my hurt. Let those that will say-- Turn them back as reward for the shame. Oh, make haste. Make haste, dear God. Make haste to deliver me. Here you go, boss. Well. You folks look to be mighty flush. Oh, we do all right. What circuit have y'all been on? I'm just asking, 'cause you know the Daily Brothers had a hard summer. Real hard. Hey, I heard y'all lost a few acts. Now that's got to be tough. You looking to hook up with us? Well, we might be persuaded. Forget it. - Howdy. - Howdy. Bert Hagenbeck, nice to meet you. It's mighty christian of you to lend a hand. That is the worst damned he/she I ever did see. When did you ever see a good one? Never. - I ought you some grub. - Thanks. You don't have to keep me company. I know that. I can do without all the jibber-jabber. It's bad enough we had to drive stakes here for the day. What's the rush? It's not like you really know where your father is. I've got a pretty good idea. Where? Damascus. I've been to Damascus. You want to know what's in Damascus? A whole lot of pigshit and no one to shovel it. Maybe. And what if he is there? What difference is it gonna make? People like you and me, we don't have nice little families. You're not gonna find anything good there. I know that. But I still got to find him. I'm leaving. There's nothing left for me here. You could come with me. I don't care what you say. You don't belong here-- no more than I do. Belonging has got nothing to do with it. It's just... My lot, that's all. It doesn't have to be. Yeah... It does. Everything's in place. Folks are already staking out seats for your sermon tonight. I've arranged for a public adress system with a loud speaker outside for the overflow. And the authorities? I've contacted the county prosecutor. He'll be there personally. I'm sorry. Sorry? I know this must be very difficult for you. Yes. Yes, it is. But my ministry must come first. That's what makes you a great man. She'll be all right. We'll get a good lawyer. She'll never see the inside of a courtroom. No? She's a woman. They don't hang women in California. Olga Moreno? I know her. Met her in Anderson, Indiana, awhile back. Olga Moreno's a cow. And that beard of hers is gaffed. No! Horsehair. I'll tell you one thing, I am sick of the road. Me and Felix, we been looking into one of them alligator farms down in Florida. I heard of them. Show them off to tourists, raise them for skins. Yeah... And the meat. - And the milk. - Milk? Gator milk has twice the vitamins and minerals as cow milk. It's what you call an investment opportunity. Come on, sugar puss. - That's our song. - Bert, honey. All right. We'll be right back. /* That's Charlie, Charlie Two-Step */ /* That's Charlie, the hottest man in town */ /* That's Charlie, and when he starts to two-step */ /* That's Charlie-- yowzer! */ Dance? Oh! Oh, I forgot. How much is it for a dance, huh? Two bits? Four? Hmm? I mean with your clothes on. Leave me alone, Burley. Come and dance with me, little girl.

I was thinking with that big win you had at the fight, maybe we could make a down payment on that place in the Keys. Well sure, put a down payment, get a new car, get you some new clothes, or... or a trip to Niagara Falls. That's a mighty big payoff. How much did you say it was? $1400. I thought you said it was $1200. $1400. /* Snowball, my honey */ /* Smile at me each day */ /* 'cause Daddy likes those dark brown eyes */ /* You're my only sweetheart */ /* Little chocolate bar */ /* I'll eat you up someday */ /* Your two hands and feet are... */ Come on. What? You can't stay in this truck all night. /* "Why stay?" the good Lord said */ /* He used an apple dumpling */ /* To make your head */ /* You know that's really something */ /* Snowball, my honey, don't you melt away */ /* 'cause Daddy likes those dark brown eyes... */ I can't. Sure you can. I've seen you dance. You're pretty good. Me, I ain't no Fred Astaire, but I like this song.

Oh, this dress will be just darling on you. You may have to take in the bosom, but this blue will be just swell with your eyes. - Ain't this a dear? - It's yours. And I thought that you and Felix might be about the same size. - I do like this hat. - Well, of course you do. Look at that. - That's good, right? - Hey, hey, hey. That's my favorite thatch! I use that in the show. Thank you much. What the hell you doing, woman? Now, Felix, these people just about lost everything they got. It's only right that we give away a few of our old things.

Felix, I'm feeling just fine. You go on and keep everything you got. God damn it, are you out of your gourd?! God damn! Who cares about these clothes, Felix? We're gonna be rich, ain't we? We're gonna buy ourselves an alligator farm, and a new car, a brand new car, and go on vacation, right? Ain't that what you said? Yeah. Fine. I lost it. All of it? Yeah. Now, Rita Sue...

Hawkins! - I'm sorry, I gotta go. - Go. go. /* ...Since God is marching on */ /* Glory, glory hallelujah */ /* Glory, glory hallelujah */ /* Glory, glory hallelujah */ /* His truth is marching on. */ Hallelujah, brothers and sisters! - Hallelujah! - And amen. Amen! Amen, brothers and sisters. Please be seated. I have an important announcement to make, one that will profoundly affect the future of this ministry. As you know, our congregation was born from the ashes of an unspeakable tragedy, a tragedy that still cries out for justice. - Oh Lord! - Speak, father! One year ago, six innocent children and their matron were murdered, cruelly consumed in the hellish flames of an arson fire... A crime for which no man has yet to face judgment. Since that terrible day, I have made it my personal mandate to see to it that the monster that committed this abominable act be captured, tried, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the laws of man. Brothers and sisters, I stand before you To report that the investigation undertaken by this ministry Has at long last borne fruit. A perpetrator has been identified and a confession has been signed! - Hallelujah! - Yes! But wait! Wait, brothers and sisters. This is not cause for jubilation. No. But for lamentation. Yes, lament, brothers and sisters. Lament, for the killer is not a stranger but one of our own. A trusted leader in our ministry... masquerading as a member of our family in Christ! Mr. Dolan? Good evening, brothers and sisters. My name is Tommy Dolan. Many of you know me from the radio, and the work I've done on behalf of this great ministry. As Brother Justin said, this congregation... was born of tragedy. I pray only that it isn't torn asunder by what you hear tonight. I'd like to now read from a signed statement. "On the evening of September 8th, 1934, I entered the dignity ministry poured gasoline on the floor of the basement and set fire to the orphanage. My motive was to get an exclusive story, so that I might advance... My career"? He's the one! He killed them kids! No! No! No, it was Iris. She confessed! She signed it! "I fell under a shadow. It preyed upon me. It needed to be done. Signed--" Oh my God. Tommy Dolan, By the power vested in me by the county of San Benito, I hereby place you under arrest. This is ridiculous! I didn't do anything! It was her! She killed those kids! You set me up. Oh, Tommy. You son of a bitch! Hey! "And now, ladies and gentlemen, lend a kind ear "as we bring you Brother Justin's Saturday evening Church of the Air! "Whom are you struggling with? Certainly not God. "God's mind was made up long before "the foundation of Earth was laid. "Let the wicked man forsake his ways. "When? In a month? "A day? "No, now. "The instant you yield, God's plan of salvation is thrown into gear. "You will be saved before you even know it, "like a child being born." Charlie? Come on in, sugar. Don't be shy. Don't worry, I won't bite. Unless you want me to. Where's the boy? Samson. I'll give you 5% of the receipts on the tenner, your meals and gas for the truck. - 20%. - You out of your mind, woman. You know what kind of a draw I am. 10%, now that's my final top offer. 15%, and not a jot less. Ray and Dil Daily give me that, plus 50 suds a week. Yeah, well, Ray and Dil Daily burned down their ten-in-one and left you high and dry. I'm thinking I look mighty good next to that. What about Bert? What about him? I ain't coming without him. He's my husband. You married that bird? Anything he gets is coming out of your cut. Fine. By the way, who told you Ray and Dil burned us down? Well, they did, didn't they? Don't know. There was a bald-headed fella nosing around. Had a badge, but he weren't no cop. - He's ahead of us? - Apparently so. Bound to be miles ahead by now. Looking for a fella named Scudder. She thinks that this bald-headed fella - torched the Daily Brothers outfit? - She does. How did he get ahead of us? I don't know. But you'd best get ahead of him. If he gets to Scudder first, something tells me there ain't gonna be much of him left. I'm heading out then. Faster on my own. We'll meet up in Damascus. You sure about that? Unless you got any better ideas. I'll tell him. This scorpion gal-- Why should we believe her? She ain't lying. I mean, she's lied about plenty, but she ain't lying about this. How do you know that? We was married for nine years. That's right. Oh, that's right. Didn't I tell you boys the best way to follow somebody is to get ahead of them? Well, that's enough airing out for you two. I've got to get you two boys in a hole. You're stinking up the Dodge. How could you? How could you do that to me? What, dear? Penance? Only with sacrifice comes redemption. Mother is dead! Much obliged! Okay, children! Let's shake some dust! Subtitles: Lama & Raceman - www.forom.com -
