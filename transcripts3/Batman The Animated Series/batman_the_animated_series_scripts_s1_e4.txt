 VOICE ON POLICE RADIO: Two-Baker—six. Two-Baker—six. 204 at Gotham Island Tramway, south-side terminal. Respond, code 2. Let's finish this. Fast Before we have the law on our necks. BATMAN: Too late, dirtbag. Huh? Who said that? The Batman! Not him! Where is he? GRUNTING GRUNTS GRUNTS GRUNTS SHOUTS GASPING Wayne. Bruce Wayne. He set me up. Cover me! COP: Stay where you are! Don't move! Ready on the set. I'll go get Matt. Come on, come on. Where are you? TEDDY: Matt, uh, you okay in there? GRUNTING Maﬂ? HAGEN: Close the door! It's Teddy, Matt. HAGEN: Close the door! Help me look. It's gotta be in here somewhere. The face cream? You used up your last jar yesterday. I gotta have more! Now, see. It wore off. Look! I can't fix it anymore! Relax, Matt. Don't tell me to relax, you idiot! I can't go out there like this! Here. Give it to me! BREATHING HEAVILY Huh? That's all? l was lucky I could hang on to that much. PANTING You were holding out on me? I had to, Matt. If I didn't, you wouldn't have any now. SIGHS You can't go on like this, Matt. You hurt all the time now. You're just my stand-in. Nobody promoted you to nursemaid. That stuff makes your face like putty, Matt. It can't be good for you. It probably ain't good for me. But unless I only wanna do horror pictures, it ain't bad for me either. Gone! Empty! Only 24 hours, then it starts all over again. KNOCKING ON DOOR MAN: Mr. Hagen, we're waiting! Keep your shirt on! That's what ain't good for you. Having to keep going back to Daggett for more of that stuff, and do whatever lousy thing he wants to get it. You're right, Teddy. I can't. I'll have to find a way to get lots of this stuff on my own. DAGGETT: You're sure, Bell? POLICE RADIO CHATTER ON HEADPHONES You're sure that the man you hired knows nothing about our operation? Bell! | asked you a question. Bell! Bell! Germs, take off his headphones. Pay attention. Mr. Daggett is talking to you. CHATTER CONTINUES Now, then. Relax, Mr. Daggett. The guy was just a hired gun. He don't even know our names. Thank heaven for small favors. But Hagen has disappointed me once too often lately. He botched this assignment completely. To wit, once Fox is able to talk, he might very well incriminate us, if the police can't figure out what we're up to from those papers Hagen was supposed to retrieve. Frankly, I think our Mr. Hagen has outlived his usefulness. I want him dealt with. But, Mr. Daggett, the man's a master of disguise. He was even before he had his accident, and you gave him this stuff. Yeah. It's not easy finding somebody who can change the way he looks. CHUCKLES You needn't bother searching for him. This is the only place in the world where he can get what he needs. And when his supply runs out, he'll come to us. FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING SNORING PANTING SIGHS IN RELIEF BELL: Hold it right there. Turn around, real slow. Step into the light where we can see you. I'm looking for Mr. Daggett. I don't believe we've met. My name is Wayne. Bruce Wayne. Wayne, huh? Yeah, right. Sure. GRUNTING Can the garbage, Hagen. We ain't stupid. GRUNTS GRUNTS -No! -You're Hagen, all right. Broke in for more of that stuff, didn't you? Yeah, once they're hooked, they stay hooked. Come on, Hagen, we're going for a little ride. Forget it! I know what that means! Wait! I got an idea. Hold him. GRUNTING Pretty boy wanted more of this stuff? Then let's give it to him. HAGEN: No! Not that way! Please! BELL: Let's give him all he'll ever need. HAGEN: No! No! Don't! Sweet dreams, slimeball. HAGEN GROANING BATMAN: I know my fist has landed on that jaw once before. Bell. Raymond Bell. Of course! Now I remember him. Carries a pocket radio, tuned to police band at all times. Master Bruce, what am I to do about the police? They shall be back, you know.
