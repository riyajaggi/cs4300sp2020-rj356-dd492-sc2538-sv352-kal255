 ♪ VERONICA, BETTY ♪ JUGHEAD, TOO ♪ WEIRD ♪ ARCHIE'S WEIRD MYSTERIES ♪ [GROANING] HI, BETTY! HI, VERONICA! HEY, GIRLS! Both: HI, BOYS! DID YOU SEE THE WAY THEY WERE LOOKING AT ME? YEAH, LIKE YOU WERE SOME KIND OF CIRCUS FREAK. YOU WISH, REGGIE. ACTUALLY, THEY WISH REGGIE. THEY WISH REGGIE WOULD GIVE THEM ONE OF HIS MAGNIFICENT MANTLE SMILES. AH! [SIGHS] I GUESS I'LL HAVE MERCY. [LAUGHS] OH, LADIES. [GIGGLING] I THINK WE'VE GOT A FAN. AH! IS THAT A SMILE OR IS HE IN PAIN? I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S IN PAIN BUT HE SURE CAN BE A PAIN. [GIGGLING] WHAT DID I TELL YA? UHH! THE MANTLE MAGIC GETS THEM EVERY TIME. OH, YEAH? THAT'S NOTHING. JUST WAIT TILL I GIVE THEM A HEALTHY DOSE OF TRIPLE A. TRIPLE A? ARCHIE ANDREWS ACTION. Archie, thinking: OK, ARCHIE, CONCENTRATE. DON'T THINK ABOUT THE GIRLS, JUST DO WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO. NOW! [GRUNTING] WOO HOO! UHH! HUH? NICE ONE, ANDREWS. I'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR MANTLE MAGIC TOP THAT. YEAH, WELL, TELL ME THIS. WOULD YOU HAVE WASTED ALL THAT ENERGY POLE VAULTING IF NO ONE HAD BEEN WATCHING YOU? SURE. THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO DO YOUR BEST, ESPECIALLY WHEN NO ONE'S AROUND TO SEE YOU DO IT. ARE YOU KIDDING? WHEN NO ONE'S WATCHING IS WHEN YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH ALL SORTS OF THINGS. YOU'RE WARPED. ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE I'M SURE THE GIRLS HAD THEIR EYES GLUED ON ME THE WHOLE TIME. OH, THEIR EYES WERE GLUED ALL RIGHT. BUT NOT ON YOU! WHAT? NOT YOUR CHEESY SMILE. WORSE THAN THAT. OH, NO! ROBBIE DOBKINS? OH, ROBBIE! WOW, LOOK AT THOSE MUSCLES. BET YOU CAN BEAT ANYONE. Reggie: THE RIVERDALE SUPERJOCK WHO EDGED ME OFF THE TRACK TEAM. Both: OOOH! [GIGGLING] WOW! HE'S PUT ON SOME MUSCLE SINCE LAST YEAR. [GIGGLING]Reggie: JUST A FEW. [GROANING] OH, HEY, REGGIE! SORRY ABOUT TAKING YOUR PLACE ON THE TEAM. DON'T MENTION IT. YOU'RE LOOKING PUMPED, ROBBIE. YOU ARE THE HUNKIEST, ROBBIE. WOW! YOU'RE SO STRONG. YEAH, I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT. I'LL SAY. CHECK OUT THESE MUSCLES. ROBBIE IS GOING TO BE IN THE TRACK MEET TODAY AFTER SCHOOL. WELL, I BETTER GO PRACTICE MY POLE VAULTING. OOOH! DID YOU HEAR THAT? ROBBIE POLE VAULTS. OH, I JUST LOVE TO WATCH A MAN POLE VAULTING. HMM. I'M TELLING YOU, ARCHIE. WHEN IT COMES TO GIRLS, A GUY LIKE DOBKINS MAKES SUCKERS LIKE US INVISIBLE. Professor: AND NOW, FOR THE REST OF TODAY'S CLASS, I WANT YOU ALL TO CHOOSE A LAB PARTNER FOR TOMORROW'S ASSIGNMENT. I'M AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT, GIRLS.Both: HUH? BUT YOU BETTER ASK QUICKLY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. UH, GIRLS? I KNOW REGGIE CAN BE A PAIN BUT YOU DO REALIZE THAT ONLY ONE OF YOU CAN BE MY LAB PARTNER? SAY? WHAT GIVES? WHAT DO YOU THINK? HUH? GEE, ROBBIE. I SEE YOU DON'T HAVE A LAB PARTNER YET. UH, NO, I DON'T. I'M REALLY GOOD AT CHEMISTRY. I'M NOT. BUT DADDY WILL HIRE US THE BEST TUTORS MONEY CAN BUY. Archie: SAY, RONNIE, IF HE WON'T BE YOUR LAB PARTNER, I WILL. THAT'S SWEET, ARCHIE. BUT ROBBIE'S ALREADY DECIDED ON ME. HAVEN'T YOU, ROBBIE-KINS? WHAT DID I TELL YA, ARCH? WE'RE JUST A COUPLE OF INVISIBLE GUYS. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO COMPETE WITH MUSCLES LIKE THAT. OOPS! HAVING SOME TROUBLE THERE, DILTON? WHA--? HUH? WHO SAID THAT? [SQUEAKING] OH! HELLO, ARCHIE! AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO FIND A LAB PARTNER BEFORE YOU START? ACTUALLY, NO. YOU SEE, I ALREADY FINISHED THIS WEEK'S ASSIGNMENT LAST WEEK. SO, WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF? ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES TO GETTING AHEAD IN CLASS IS THAT I CAN THEN USE THE SCHOOL'S RESOURCES TO RUN MY OWN EXPERIMENTS. WHAT KIND OF EXPERIMENTS? WELL, CURRENTLY, I'M DEVELOPING A FORMULA THAT WITH ONLY ONE EXTERNAL APPLICATION ENHANCES PHYSIQUE. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? OBSERVE. [LIQUID SQUISHING] [LIQUID BUBBLING] WITH ONLY ONE EXTERNAL APPLICATION, [SQUISHING] THE FORMULA ENHANCES THE REPTILES PHYSIQUE. [AMAZED] YOU GAVE HIM MUSCLES. PRECISELY! THAT'S AMAZING! HOW LONG DOES IT LAST? LET'S SEE! USUALLY A FEW HOURS. THEN ACCORDING TO MY ENTRIES, "THE REPTILE RETURNS TO NORMAL, EXPERIENCING TEMPORARY FEELINGS OF INADEQUACY." [SNARLING] HA! ANY MORE MUSCLES AND THE GIRLS WILL BE ASKING THAT LIZARD TO BE THEIR LAB PARTNER. SAY! THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA. HUH? SO, DILT. OLD BUDDY, OLD PAL. HOW MUCH FOR A SHOT OF THE MUSCLE JUICE? HUH? IT'S NOT FOR SALE. HUH? BESIDES, I'VE NEVER TRIED THIS STUFF ON A HUMAN TEST SUBJECT BEFORE. WELL, NOW'S YOUR CHANCE. I'LL VOLUNTEER. NO WAY! THIS STUFF IS EXTREMELY UNSTABLE. THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT IT WOULD DO TO A HUMAN BEING! I'LL TAKE THAT CHANCE IF IT MEANS I GET TO BULK UP AND MAKE DOBKINS FEEL LIKE THE INVISIBLE MAN FOR ONCE. FORGET IT, MANTLE. IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION. YEAH, COME ON, REGGIE. I WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND. HA! HA! YEAH, ME, TOO! WOULD BE PRETTY FUNNY THOUGH, HUH? [LAUGHTER] [BELL RINGING] [KIDS TALKING] SO, WHAT'S YOUR LAST CLASS FOR THE DAY? HISTORY WITH GRUNDY. Dilton: I'LL HAVE TO CHECK WITH PROFESSOR FLUTESNOOT. BUT I THOUGHT OLD FLUTESNOOT DIDN'T TEACH IN THE LAB THIS PERIOD. HE DOESN'T. BUT AS SOON AS I TURN IN THIS ASSIGNMENT, I'VE GOT PERMISSION TO COME BACK AND WORK ON MY FORMULA. HELLO, MUSCLES. REGGIE? UH--UH, ARCHIE. WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? SHEESH! I FORGOT MY BACKPACK. OH--OH, YEAH. BACKPACK, UH, ME, TOO. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. REGGIE, PUT THAT BACK. OH, COME ON, ARCH. JUST ONE SPRINKLE. IF HE DOESN'T SEE US TRY IT, HE'LL NEVER KNOW. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'LL BE SEEN OR NOT. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. DILTON SAID NO. IT COULD BE DANGEROUS. BUT, ARCHIE, DON'T YOU WANT BETTY AND VERONICA TO NOTICE YOU AGAIN? WELL, YES, BUT--BUT NOTHING. THIS IS OUR CHANCE AND I FOR ONE AM TIRED OF BEING INVISIBLE. REGGIE, DON'T! [LIQUID POURING] Both: UHH! UHH! UHH! [LIQUID SPLASHES] NOW LOOK WHAT YOU DID. SORRY! WELL, I DIDN'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN BUT NOW THAT IT DID, UH, SHOULDN'T SOMETHING HAPPEN? [GROANING] GREAT! ALL THIS TROUBLE FOR NOTHING. WELL, I HOPE YOU'VE LEARNED YOUR LESSON. YOU WERE RIGHT, ARCH, I'M SORRY. LOOK, THERE'S STILL SOME LEFT. I'LL PUT IT BACK AND WE'LL PRETEND THIS NEVER HAPPENED. AH, ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. BUT IF DILTON ASKS, I'M TELLING HIM THE TRUTH. I BETTER HURRY OR I'M GONNA BE LATE FOR CLASS. [GASPS] WHOA! I'M FEELING KIND OF FUNNY. OH, GREAT! DON'T TELL ME THAT STUPID FORMULA'S GOING TO WORK AFTER ALL. WELL, I DON'T FEEL THE SAME, BUT I LOOK THE SAME. HMM. HUH? ALL THAT BUSINESS AT THE LAB HAS GOT ME PARANOID. [MAGICAL SOUNDS] AH! AAH! WHA--? I--? WHERE? [ZAPPING] AAH! [ZAPPING]  AAH! I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I'M INVISIBLE! THAT'S WEIRD, I FEEL KIND OF LIGHTHEADED.RB [ZAP] [KIDS TALKING] Reggie: HERE COMES VERONICA. AND DOBKINS IS NOWHERE IN SIGHT. BETTER WARM UP THE MAGNIFICENT MANTLE SMILE. [DING] HMM. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, SHE JUST TOTALLY IGNORED ME. OH! HEY, MOOSE. HIGH FIVE. HUH? THAT'S WEIRD. MOOSE ACTED LIKE HE DIDN'T EVEN SEE ME. [BELL RINGING] BEING DISSED BY VERONICA IS ONE THING, BUT MOOSE? HMM? THAT'S ODD. I'M CERTAIN THAT THIS WAS 80 MILLILITERS FULL. IT'S TOO SOON FOR EVAPORATION TO TAKE EFFECT SO THAT MEANS ONLY ONE THING. DILTON! WHA--? YOU STARTLED ME. I NEARLY-- HEY! WHO SAID THAT? IT'S ME, ARCHIE. UH, I'M INVISIBLE. ARCHIE? INVISIBLE? [FOOTSTEPS] OK, WHAT'S THE GAG? GAH! THIS IS NO GAG, DILTON! I'M INVISIBLE. YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. WHOA! YOU WEREN'T KIDDING! HOW'D THIS HAPPEN? YOUR FORMULA. REGGIE AND I BOTH GOT SOME ON US. I TOLD YOU IT WAS UNSTABLE. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, HONEST. SO IT MADE YOU INVISIBLE. INTERESTING. IS REGGIE WITH YOU? NO, I THINK HE'S STILL IN GRUNDY'S HISTORY CLASS. [CHAIR SCRAPING FLOOR] ALL RIGHT, CLASS. PASS UP YOUR HOMEWORK WHILE I TAKE ATTENDANCE. OOPS! UH, BETTER SIGN MY NAME. [PAPERS RUSTLING] HEY! DON'T FORGET MINE. SHEESH! YOU'D THINK I REALLY WAS INVISIBLE. REGGIE MANTLE? HUH? DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY REGGIE IS ABSENT? I SAW HIM EARLIER TODAY. I'M NOT ABSENT, I'M-- [CHAIR SCRAPING]AHH! I'M INVISIBLE. [CLASS LAUGHS] HUH? AHH! I DON'T KNOW WHO SAID THAT, BUT YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE WITH SUCH NONSENSE. NOW, LET'S ALL OPEN OUR BOOKS TO PAGE 21. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? [TAPPING] WAIT A MINUTE. I'M INVISIBLE. NO ONE CAN SEE ME. I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT. THIS IS TERRIBLE! NOT ONLY DOES THE FORMULA NOT ENHANCE THE PHYSIQUE OF HUMAN BEINGS, BUT IT SEEMS TO DO QUITE THE OPPOSITE. GOING FAR BEYOND SIMPLY TAKING AWAY YOUR PHYSIQUE, IT'S ACTUALLY TAKING AWAY YOUR ENTIRE APPEARANCE, TOO. Archie: I'M OVER HERE. UH, SORRY. YOU SAID IT ONLY LASTED A FEW HOURS, RIGHT? YES, BUT THAT WAS ON LIZARDS THAT DIDN'T EVEN TURN INVISIBLE. IF MY CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT, YOU'RE GOING TO COMPLETELY FADE FROM EXISTENCE WITHIN A FEW HOURS. FADE FROM EXISTENCE? AS IN GONE FOREVER. AS IN GONE FOREVER? HUH? OH, MY! SO WHAT DO WE DO? I'LL TRY TO MAKE AN ANTIDOTE THAT'LL COUNTERACT THE FORMULA AND MAKE YOU VISIBLE AGAIN. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU NEED TO FIND REGGIE AND BRING HIM BACK HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIND EACH OTHER IF WE'RE BOTH INVISIBLE? GOOD POINT! HOW DO I LOOK? LIKE A THRIFT STORE EXPLODED. BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. WORRY ABOUT FINDING REGGIE. THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME! NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE MAP. UHH! [KIDS TALKING] OOPSIE! LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN! NOW, AS I WAS SAYING-- OOOH! [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [GROWLING] AAH! [CRASH] [LAUGHTER] THERE'S MISS GRUNDY'S CLASSROOM. MAYBE REGGIE'S STILL-- [LAUGHTER] Reggie: THIS IS GREAT! UH![FOOTSTEPS] REGGIE, IS THAT YOU? Reggie: ARCHIE, OOOH! YOU CAN'T SEE ME. YEAH, I KNOW WE'RE BOTH INVISIBLE. NOW, WOULD YOU STOP FOOLING AROUND? RELAX, ARCHIE, INVISIBILITY IS THE MOST FUN YOU'LL EVER HAVE. YEAH, AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE LAST FUN WE EVER HAVE IF WE DON'T GET BACK TO DILTON AND FAST. OH, NO! I'M NOT GETTING VISIBLE UNTIL I'VE HAD SOME FUN WITH DOBKINS AND THE GIRLS. REGGIE, LISTEN TO ME. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. REGGIE? REGGIE? [REGGIE BANGING AND LAUGHING] HEY, WAIT UP! UHH! AND JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING, YOUNG MAN? PRINCIPAL WEATHERBY! ARCHIE! ARCHIE ANDREWS! IS THAT YOU?%P[ UH, YES, SIR. WELL, TAKE OFF THAT RIDICULOUS GETUP SO I CAN GET A GOOD LOOK AT YOU. NO! I MEAN, UH, NO, SIR. I CAN'T. AND WHY NOT? WELL, SIR, I CAN'T BECAUSE I HAVE, UM, UH... A SKIN CONDITION. SKIN CONDITION? OH, YES. IT'S VERY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT, MY SKIN. THAT'S MY CONDITION. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO ANDREWS, BUT I TRUST YOU HAVE A HALL PASS TO GO WITH THAT SKIN CONDITION. HALL PASS? UH-OH! WELL, SCHOOL'S ALMOST OUT FOR THE DAY, SO I THOUGHT MAYBE-- MAYBE YOU'D COME BACK TO MY OFFICE FOR DETENTION? WHAT A SPLENDID IDEA! WAIT! NO, MR. WEATHERBY. SIR, I CAN'T GO TO DETENTION, RIGHT NOW, I-- LET ME GUESS. DETENTION'S BAD FOR YOUR SKIN CONDITION. ACTUALLY, YES, SIR. IT'S THE WORST. COME ON, ANDREWS. Reggie: LOOKS LIKE I'VE GOT TIME FOR SOME FUN BEFORE THE TRACK MEET. AHA! ROBBIE MUST BE OUT OF CLASS EARLY FOR TRACK PRACTICE. OH, THIS IS TOO GOOD! [WATER SPLASHES][ROBBIE GASPS] HEY! [REGGIE SNICKERING] [KIDS TALKING] Both: GO RIVERDALE ROBBIE! [CROWD CHEERING] [CHEERING] Reggie: THIS SHOULD MAKE FOR A GRAND ENTRANCE. [CHEERING] [SNAP] RATS! OF COURSE, THAT WAS BACK IN MY DAY WHICH IS WHY YOU NEED TO START SHAPING UP NOW. Archie, thinking: I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE AND FIND DILTON BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. [ALOUD] YES, SIR. CAN I GO NOW? YOU KIDS THESE DAYS ARE ALWAYS IN SUCH A RUSH. I THINK FIRST WE SHOULD DISCUSS YOUR-- [TELEPHONE RINGS]EXCUSE ME, ARCHIE. WEATHERBY HERE. AH, MRS. HUDSUCKER, WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE. HMM! [THINKING] I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE. ACTUALLY, I HAVE A STUDENT IN MY OFFICE AT THE MOMENT. YES. YES, I'LL SPEAK TO YOU THEN. UH, GOODBYE, MRS... HUDSUCKER? EUREKA, I'VE GOT IT! Archie: DILTON!AHH! YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO STOP DOING THAT. SORRY! HERE! TRY A SPLASH OF THIS. [LIQUID POURING] HEY! I THINK IT'S WORKING. DILTON! YOU DID IT. YOU DID IT. WHAT ABOUT REGGIE? OH, RIGHT! HE GOT AWAY FROM ME. BUT I KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM. HUH? HE'S SOMEWHERE AT THIS TRACK MEET. [CHEERING AND TALKING] [GULPS] REGGIE'S GOING TO DISAPPEAR FOR GOOD ANY MINUTE NOW. THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL FIND HIM OUT ON THAT FIELD. WELL, IF WE CAN'T GET HIM TO COME TO THE FORMULA, WE'LL JUST MAKE THE FORMULA GO TO HIM. OF COURSE! WE'LL SIMPLY TAP INTO THE SPRINKLER LINE. NOW LET'S JUST HOPE REGGIE'S OUT ON THAT FIELD. IF DOBKINS IS ON THAT FIELD, THEN SO IS REGGIE. HERE GOES NOTHING. HUH? [WATER GURGLING] [WATER GUSHING] [WATER GUSHING] [PEOPLE GASPING] Both: OOOH! AAH! OOOH! WHAT THE--? SPRINKLERS? WELL, A LITTLE WATER ISN'T GOING TO SAVE DOBKINS FROM THE INVISIBLE REGGIE. THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE. [GASPS] [GASPING AND LAUGHING] AHH! [LAUGHING] OHH! MANTLE!HUH? Both: HUH? [PUNCHING AND GROANING] WE DID IT! HUH? [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Archie, typing: POOR REGGIE, WHO THINKS HE WAS THE VICTIM OF OUR PRACTICAL JOKE. WHEN, REALLY, WE WERE USING THE SPRINKLERS TO SAVE HIS LIFE. GRANTED, HE GOT CLOBBERED IN THE PROCESS, BUT THAT WAS HIS OWN FAULT. MAYBE NEXT TIME REGGIE'S INVISIBLE, HE WON'T USE IT AS AN EXCUSE TO CAUSE TROUBLE IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RIVERDALE.
