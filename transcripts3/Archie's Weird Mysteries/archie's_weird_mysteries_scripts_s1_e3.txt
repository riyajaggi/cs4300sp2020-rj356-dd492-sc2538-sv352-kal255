 Archie's Weird Mysteries (1999–2000): Season 1, Episode 3 - Me! Me! Me! - full transcript 
 Reluctantly preparing donations to the local museum for her father, whiny and self-centered Veronica gets a taste of her own medicine. When she wishes "that everyone be like me", little does she know that the talisman she holds in her hand as she makes her wish, possesses magical powers. Soon Riverdale citizens are turning into whining Veronicas. Archie and the gang must find the talisman before they too are changed into Veronica.

HONESTLY, YOU'RE SO CLUMSY, ARCHIE. SORRY. VERONICA'S IN TOP FORM TODAY. THE QUEEN OF WHINE COMMANDS HER LOYAL SUBJECT. [WHINES] ARCHIE, HURRY UP! I WANT TO GET HOME! GUYS, SHOW VERONICA A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING. THIS IS JUST A STAGE SHE'S GOING THROUGH. YOU MEAN THE SPOILED, SELF-CENTERED, WHINEY-RICH-GIRL STAGE? THE ONE THAT STARTED THE DAY VERONICA TOOK HER FIRST BREATH? [ARCHIE PANTING] THESE SURE ARE A LOT OF BOOKS YOU'RE TAKING HOME, VERONICA. YOU MUST HAVE A LOT OF HOMEWORK. NO. I JUST DECIDED I'D RATHER BRING ALL MY BOOKS HOME EVERY DAY THAN MEMORIZE MY LOCKER COMBINATION. [GROANS] VERY...SENSIBLE. WHEW! [WHINES] ARCHIE! THE TOP IS DOWN! THE WIND WILL MESS UP MY HAIR! IF VERONICA WERE A GENIUS, SHE'D BE ALBERT WHINESTEIN. AND IF SHE WERE A CREDIT CARD, SHE'D BE THE INTERNATIONAL WHINER'S CLUB CARD. Betty: IT COULD BE WORSE. HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT? YOU COULD BE ARCHIE. UHH! UHH! MMM. [GASPS] MY SPOON'S DIRTY. SMITHERS! I NEED A NEW SPOON! OH! SMITHERS! HURRY! MY YOGURT'S MELTING. OH! THIS SPOON IS TOO BIG. I NEED A SMALL SPOON FOR MY DAINTY MOUTH. OF COURSE. I FORGOT. HMM. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [WHINES] SMITHERS! IT'S TOO FAR! GET THE PHONE! [RING] SOMEONE NEEDS A MAJOR ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT. JUST KEEP REMEMBERING MR. LODGE PAYS FOR 6 WEEKS OF VACATION EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THERE ARE DAYS LIKE THIS. AND SMILE, SMITHERS. HELLO? JUST A MOMENT. IT'S FOR YOU. HELLO? ARCHIE! POP TATE'S CHOCK'LIT SHOPPE? ARE YOU DRIVING? I'D LOVE TO GO! UHH! VERONICA WILL MEET YOU LATER, ARCHIE. SHE HAS A CHORE TO DO. OHH, BUT, DADDY! I WANT TO GO TO THE MALT SHOP WITH ARCHIE! I DON'T WANT TO DO CHORES! YOUNG LADY, I'VE HAD IT WITH YOUR CONSTANT WHINING! YOU ACT LIKE YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD! WHAT IF EVERYONE ACTED LIKE THAT? I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT IF PEOPLE WERE MORE LIKE ME, THE WORLD WOULD BE PRETTY NICE. VERONICA, YOU'RE A LODGE. SOMEDAY, ALL THIS WILL BE YOURS. RUNNING A FORTUNE LIKE OURS IS A LOT OF HARD WORK. YOU DON'T STAY RICH BY LYING AROUND AND WHINING ALL DAY. OHH, BUT I HATE HARD WORK. WHAT'S THIS CHORE ANYWAY? AH! OHH! YOU WANT ME TO PACK THESE UP FOR THE MUSEUM? YOU HAVE AN HOUR BEFORE THE MUSEUM WORKMEN ARRIVE TO PICK THEM UP. OHH! I CAN'T DO ALL THAT ALONE! OH, YOU WON'T BE ALONE. SMITHERS WILL BE HERE. WHEW! I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT YOU WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE ME HANDLE ALL THIS STUFF. WHAT YOU REALLY WANT ME TO DO IS SUPERVISE SMITHERS. ACTUALLY, SMITHERS WILL BE SUPERVISING YOU. HUH? OHH! [WHISTLING] AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY FOR THIS. [CHOMPING] HERE. HAVE MINE. I'VE LOST MY APPETITE. THANKS, GUY. YOU'RE IN A MERRY MOOD TODAY, POP. WHY SHOULDN'T I BE? I OWN MY OWN BUSINESS, I ENJOY MY WORK, AND I MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY ALL DAY. [WHISTLES] HEY. ANY WORD ON VERONICA? SHE'S STILL PACKING SOME OF HER DAD'S ARTIFACTS FOR THAT MUSEUM EXHIBIT. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT SHOW TO OPEN. I'VE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH THIS EXHIBIT CATALOG FOR WEEKS. THERE'S SOME STRANGE STUFF IN HERE. MAYBE THERE WILL BE AN "ARCHIE'S WEIRD MYSTERIES" COLUMN IN IT. HERE'S AN UGLY-LOOKING FELLA. SNIKBOD. Betty: IT MEANS "GRANTER OF WISHERS," ACCORDING TO LEGEND. [WHINES] WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT THIS ONE? IT'S THE LAST ONE. PACK IT IN THAT BOX. OHH, I DON'T SEE WHY ANYONE WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO GO TO SOME LOUSY MUSEUM TO SEE ALL THIS JUNK ANYWAY. I THINK IT'S BORING. NOT EVERYONE IS LIKE YOU, VERONICA. MAYBE YOU SHOULD MAKE AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND HOW OTHERS THINK AND FEEL. WELL, OBVIOUSLY NO ONE IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW I THINK AND FEEL. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME. I WISH EVERYONE WOULD BECOME JUST LIKE ME. THEN THEY'D KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. HUH? THERE. ALL DONE. CAN I GO NOW? UH, YOU DIDN'T NOTICE THAT-- OH, NEVER MIND. JUST GO. SO VERONICA ACTUALLY MANAGED TO FINISH ALL THE PACKING BEFORE SHE LEFT TO MEET HER FRIENDS? AMAZING. [DOORBELL RINGS] AH, THAT MUST BE THE WORKMEN FROM THE MUSEUM. GET THAT, WILL YOU, PLEASE, SMITHERS? OHH! DO I HAVE TO? I DON'T WANT TO! HUH? [CHOMPING] AT FIRST IT SICKENED ME, BUT NOW I'M FASCINATED. WHERE DOES HE FIND ROOM FOR ALL THAT FOOD IN THAT THIN BODY? MY THEORY IS THAT SOMEWHERE IN THAT STOMACH IS A BLACK HOLE FUNNELING ALL THIS FOOD TO AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE IT FEEDS THOUSANDS. JUGHEAD HAS TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLY STRANGE METABOLISM TO NEVER GAIN A POUND. [GULPS] I'M JUST A GROWING BOY. AND I HAVE ROOM FOR MORE. WHO ARE WE TO DENY THIS FORCE OF NATURE? POP, WE NEED ANOTHER ROUND OF BURGERS FOR THE HUMAN GARBAGE DISPOSAL HERE. OHH! BUT I DON'T WANT TO. WHY DON'T YOU MAKE THEM YOURSELF? OHH! WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME? STOP IT! LEAVE ME ALONE! UH, DID YOU JUST EXPERIENCE WHAT I EXPERIENCED? I'VE HEARD OF MOOD SWINGS, BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS. MAXIMUM WEIRDNESS. BUT ISN'T THE WAY POP TATE IS ACTING SOMEHOW FAMILIAR? I'M GOING TO USE THE PAY PHONE OUTSIDE TO CALL A DOCTOR JUST IN CASE POP TATE IS REALLY ILL. THINGS CAN'T GET WEIRDER THAN THIS. DOES THIS MEAN I'M NOT GETTING ANOTHER PLATE OF BURGERS? All: HUH? OH, HI, VERONICA. I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. POP TATE IS ACTING AWFULLY WEIRD. OHH! ARCHIE! THERE'S A KETCHUP BOTTLE ON THE TOP SHELF! I CAN'T REACH IT! [GASPS] OHH! ARCHIE! ARCHIE, I'M DOUBLE-PARKED OUTSIDE. Pop Tate: [WHINES] ARCHIE! WHEN WILL I LEARN IT CAN ALWAYS GET WEIRDER THAN THIS? OHH! ARCHIE! ARCHIE! ARCHIE! ARCHIE! [GASPS] Veronica: I'M THE REAL VERONICA! Pop: NO, I'M THE REAL VERONICA. THIS SHOULD BE A LOT MORE FUN THAN IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE. OHH! ARCHIE, TELL HER I'M THE REAL VERONICA! SHE'S EVEN WORSE IN STEREO. ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS BRINGS A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO THE WORDS "DOUBLE DATING." STOP IT! LEAVE HIM ALONE! YOU'RE RIPPING ARCHIE APART! TELL THIS LOUSY IMPOSTOR TO LEAVE ARCHIE ALONE! YOU MAY LOOK A LITTLE LIKE ME, BUT I WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD IN AN OUTFIT LIKE THAT. WELL, I MAKE IT LOOK GOOD. I, VERONICA LODGE, AM JUST NATURALLY GLAMOROUS, NO MATTER WHAT I WEAR. THAT'S IT! I'VE HAD ENOUGH! QUIET, YOU TWO! OHH! BUT-- NO! NOT ANOTHER WORD. LET'S SEPARATE THESE TWO. ANYTHING TO GET THEM TO SHUT UP. REGGIE, JUGHEAD, TAKE THIS VERONICA INTO THE STOCKROOM WHILE WE SORT THIS OUT. NYAH! OH, MAN, MY HEAD. VERONICA, THAT'S NO IMPOSTOR, THAT'S POP TATE. SOMEHOW HE CHANGED INTO A DUPLICATE OF YOU. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. THERE'S AN EXPLANATION OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEARCH UNTIL WE FIND IT. OHH! THAT COULD TAKE FOREVER! WE CAN CHECK NEWSPAPERS AT THE LIBRARY, SEE IF ANYTHING ODD HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. AT LEAST THE PROBLEM IS ISOLATED TO POP TATE. OH, NO! [GASPS] HUH? WHEN AM I GOING TO LEARN NOT TO SAY THINGS LIKE THAT? YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A TRENDSETTER, VERONICA, BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS. THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPLANATION FOR ALL OF THIS. LOOK! I'M STEALING MY CAR! OR ONE OF ME IS STEALING MY CAR. STOP, THIEF! [GASPS] COME BACK, VERONICA! YOU SHOULDN'T SEPARATE FROM US. WE'LL LOSE YOU. WE BETTER GO AFTER HER. GET OUT OF MY CAR THIS INSTANT! OHH! BUT IT'S NOT YOUR CAR, IT'S MY CAR. I'M VERONICA. DID YOU SEE THAT? SHE STOLE MY CAR! AREN'T YOU GOING TO DO SOMETHING? [WHINES] BUT THE CAR'S ALREADY HALFWAY DOWN THE STREET! AND WHAT IF I CATCH HER? I'LL HAVE TO TYPE UP A REPORT! I JUST DID MY NAILS! THIS IS AWFUL. YOU SHOULD BE MORE RESPONSIBLE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO! FORGET IT. OHH! MY FEET ARE SO TIRED! WHY DOESN'T SOMEONE DELIVER THIS MAIL FOR ME? WHY DO ALL THESE PEOPLE  WRITE LETTERS ANYWAY? DO I REALLY SOUND THAT BAD? [GASPS] OHH! I'M TIRED OF MIMING! WHY CAN'T I JUST TELL PEOPLE WHAT I'M DOING? OHH! LOOK AT ME, EVERYONE! I'M TRAPPED IN A BOX! THIS IS CRAZY. HUH? KEEP AWAY FROM ME! OHH! BUT I DON'T WANT TO! OHH! IT ISN'T FAIR! DON'T GET ANY CLOSER! OHH! WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN TO ME? LEAVE ME ALONE! BUT I NEVER GET MY WAY! QUIT YOUR LOUSY WHINING! [ALL WHINING] OOOOHHHH! [PANTING] AAAAHHH! Archie: IT'S LIKE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A... IN A NEEDLE STACK. SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE WARNED VERONICA THAT RUNNING INTO A CROWD OF YOURSELF IS A GOOD WAY OF GETTING LOST. [PANTING] OH, ARCHIE. I'M SO SORRY. I HAD NO IDEA HOW ANNOYING ALL MY WHINING IS. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU, I MEAN, THE REAL YOU. TO THINK THAT JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, I WISHED THAT EVERYONE WOULD BECOME JUST LIKE ME. WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA! HUH? WHEN WAS THAT? BACK WHEN I WAS PACKING DADDY'S ARTIFACTS, BUT THAT COULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. HMM. I WONDER. BETTY, DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT EXHIBIT CATALOG? HERE IT IS. WERE YOU HOLDING THIS WHEN YOU MADE THAT WISH? YES, I WAS! THE SNIKBOD IDOL! THE GRANTER OF WISHES. APPARENTLY, VERONICA'S WISH GOES THROUGH STAGES. FIRST, SOMEONE GETS WHINEY AND SELFISH-- LIKE ME. AND THEN THE PERSON TURNS INTO A DUPLICATE VERONICA. QUICK! CALL YOUR DAD AND HAVE HIM GET THAT IDOL BACK. WE HAVE TO GET OUR HANDS ON IT AND REVERSE THE SPELL. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] OHH! YOU GET UP AND ANSWER IT! OHH! NO, YOU GET UP AND ANSWER IT! THERE'S NO ANSWER. THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GO TO THE MUSEUM ON OUR OWN. COME ON. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY YOU GUYS HAVEN'T BEEN AFFECTED BY MY WISH. YOUR WISH COVERS EVERYONE IN THE WORLD. IT PROBABLY WORKS GRADUALLY, HITTING PEOPLE AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS. OH, NO! THAT MEANS-- YES. IF WE CAN'T REVERSE THE WISH IN TIME, WE'LL TURN INTO VERONICAS, TOO. IT SAYS HERE THAT THE SNIKBOD IDOL WAS ORIGINALLY KEPT ON A HIGH PEDESTAL SURROUNDED BY DEATH TRAPS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ITS POWERS. SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME. THAT LITTLE IDOL IS BAD NEWS. HERE'S SOME MORE BAD NEWS. THE MUSEUM HAS FAITHFULLY RECONSTRUCTED THE PEDESTAL CHAMBER,  INCLUDING THE DEATH TRAPS. DEATH TRAPS? HUH. WHAT'S A FEW DEATH TRAPS? IF YOU SET YOUR MIND TO DO SOMETHING, NOTHING CAN STOP YOU. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] Veronica: WHAT'S WRONG? OHH. WE'RE OUT OF GAS. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RUN TO THE MUSEUM. OHH! RUNNING? I HATE-- HUH? SORRY. FORCE OF HABIT. [ALL PANTING] WAIT FOR ME! Betty: COME ON! WHOA! HOW ABOUT A LITTLE REST BREAK? THERE'S NO TIME! EVERY SECOND COUNTS! WE HAVE TO FIND THAT IDOL BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE! IT WAS JUST A SUGGESTION. [SIGHS] THIS PLACE IS ENORMOUS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIND THE EXHIBIT? LET'S ASK THAT SECURITY GUARD. EXCUSE ME. DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE SNIKBOD IDOL EXHIBIT IS? OHH! HOW SHOULD I KNOW? I ONLY WORK HERE! I THINK IT'S BACK THERE SOMEWHERE. COME ON! TIME IS RUNNING OUT! I'M NOT AFRAID OF A LITTLE DARKNESS. I'M GAME IF YOU ARE. [PANTING] HUH?! OK, I LIED. I AM AFRAID OF THE DARK. HOLD MY HAND, BETTY. OHH! BUT I DON'T WANT TO HOLD YOUR HANDS. HOLD YOUR OWN HANDS! BETTY! NOT YOU, TOO! OHH! LET GO OF ME! YOU'RE HOLDING MY ARM TOO TIGHT! I BRUISE EASILY! OHH! WHY'D YOU DO THAT? YOU'RE A BIG MEANIE! BETTY! DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE? OHH! STOP IT! I'M NOT BETTY! MY NAME'S VERONICA! WHAT HAVE I DONE? ME AND MY STUPID WISH. UHH! IT WAS A DREAM, JUST A BIG NASTY DREAM. HELLO, ARCHIE-KINS. PULL ME UP. OHH! WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT? YOUR HANDS ARE PROBABLY SWEATY AND ICKY. OH, YUCK! OH, ARCHIE-KINS, I'M SORRY. NOW I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT WHO'S STILL ME. WELL, TECHNICALLY, EVERYONE ELSE IS ME, BUT THE POINT IS THAT I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT WHO CAN HANDLE THIS. AND WHY AM I TALKING TO MYSELF? [GASPS] SEEMS SAFE ENOUGH. READY OR NOT, HERE I COME WITH ANOTHER WISH. [GASPS] OK, I THINK WE'RE IN DEATH-TRAP MODE. WHOA! THIS ISN'T SO HARD. HUH? UH-OH. WHOA! AAH! HUH? AAH! WHOA! SOMEBODY REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE THIS EASY. WHOA! A LITTLE REMINDER: I'M JUST AN AVERAGE, NORMAL, RICH TEENAGE GIRL, NOT A BARBARIAN PRINCESS. SO LET'S EASE UP ON ALL THESE ORDEALS ALREADY. OH, THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. HMM. LET'S SEE. VERONICA LODGE HERE. WE HAD A MOMENT A FEW HOURS BACK. YOU, ME, AND THAT BOX. I MADE A SILLY LITTLE WISH AND YOU GRANTED IT? ANYWAY, I WAS BEING ESPECIALLY WHINEY AND SELFISH WHEN I MADE THAT WISH. WELL, NOW I KNOW WHAT A BIG PAIN IT IS BEING AROUND WHINERS. SO I WAS WONDERING... COULD YOU TAKE BACK MY WISH? I GAVE IT MY BEST SHOT. I GUESS  IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH. I JUST WISH EVERYTHING WOULD RETURN TO NORMAL. [RUMBLING] UH, DOES THAT MEAN THE WISH IS ENDED? WHAT ARE WE DOING OUT HERE? SMITHERS? WHY AM I EATING EXTRA-SCRUMPTIOUS STRAWBERRY-FLAVORED NONFAT FROZEN YOGURT? I DON'T EVEN LIKE FROZEN YOGURT. ALL RIGHT! YOU JOKERS KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE STOCKROOM. WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? AND WHY DO I HAVE WET FINGERNAIL POLISH ON MY NAILS? VERONICA! WHAT HAPPENED?! DID YOU REVERSE THE WISH? IF YOU'RE BACK TO YOUR NORMAL SELVES, I GUESS I DID. THANKS, LITTLE FELLOW. HUH? UH, YOU COULDN'T GIVE ME A LITTLE HELP GETTING OUT OF THE ROOM, COULD YOU? OH, NEVER MIND. I'LL HANDLE IT MYSELF. THEN I CLIMBED OUT OF THE HOLE AND REVERSED THE WISH. GOOD FOR YOU. YOU CAME THROUGH WITH FLYING COLORS. YOU SAVED RIVERDALE AND THE WORLD. I GUESS I DID. I MUST BE SOME TOUGH, HERO-TYPE LADY. OHH! OH, NO! I BROKE A NAIL! JUST KIDDING. Archie: THINGS ARE NORMAL AGAIN. NO ONE IN RIVERDALE REMEMBERS EVER BEING VERONICA. THERE'S ONLY THE ONE TRUE VERONICA NOW, AND BELIEVE ME, ONE IS PLENTY TO HANDLE AS IT IS. STILL, VERONICA IS A LOT LESS WHINEY NOWADAYS. MAYBE SHE GOT A BETTER LOOK AT HERSELF THAN MOST PEOPLE GET AND DECIDED TO CHANGE. WHO KNOWS? ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THIS: "BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, YOU MIGHT GET IT," IS ALWAYS GOOD ADVICE IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RIVERDALE.
