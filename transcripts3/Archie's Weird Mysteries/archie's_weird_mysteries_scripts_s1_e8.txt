BUT LET ME JUST QUICKLY SAY ONE WORD: SORRY. AND LET ME SAY JUST 2 WORDS: SMI--THERS! HUH?SMITHERS! WHO-O-A! MAYBE I'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH BETTY. THEY DON'T HAVE A BUTLER. [TAPS ON WINDOW] BETTY! HI, SWEETIE-PIE! BYE, CRUMB-CAKE. WHO-O-A! [CRASH] THINK I'LL GO HOME TO BED. I'M BUSHED. HEY, ANDREWS! I HEARD YOUR DATE LAST NIGHT WAS A HOWLING SUCCESS! GIVE ME A BREAK. IT'S A GALA DAY... AND 2 GALS A NIGHT![LAUGHING] IF ANOTHER JOKER BRINGS UP LAST NIGHT, I'M GOING STRAIGHT TO PRINCIPAL WEATHERBY! WOO! OH, SORRY, MR. ANDREWS. BY THE WAY, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT YOU TAKING MISS COOPER AND MISS LODGE TO A DOG SHOW? [LAUGHS] HEH HEH HEH. GOOD ONE, SIR. YUP. IF YOU EVER WANT TO BUST UP A DATE, HERE'S THE TICKET! [LAUGH] SHH! OH. HUH? [GASPS]SON, THIS WEREWOLF THING IS NO LAUGHING MATTER. Sheriff: I RECEIVED COMPLAINTS THAT A WOLF-CREATURE WAS TERRORIZING PEOPLE ACROSS TOWN AROUND 9 P.M. SOME PETS WERE EVEN HARMED. I-I ONLY SCARED ARCHIE LAST NIGHT! HEY, ARCHIE, OLD PAL, TELL HIM I WAS WITH YOU AT 9!  TELL HIM! YES, SHERIFF, REGGIE WAS ANNOYING ME AT 9:00 SHARP. [SIGHS]Archie: BUT AFTER THAT, WHO KNOWS WHERE HE WENT?HUH? [GASPS]SON, IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALIBI FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT, WE'RE PLAYING 20 QUESTIONS DOWN AT THE POLICE STATION. BUT...BUT... [LAUGHS] LOOKS LIKE REGGIE'S GETTING A REPUTATION FOR CRYING WOLF! OR RATHER, WOLF MAN. NOBODY BELIEVES ANYTHING HE SAYS NOW. NOW MAYBE HE'LL LEARN NOT TO PLAY PRACTICAL JOKES. TRUE. BUT WHAT IF REGGIE DIDN'T SCARE THOSE PEOPLE? MAYBE THE SHERIFF IS BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE. YOU'RE RIGHT, JUGHEAD! MAYBE THERE REALLY IS A WEREWOLF! I SMELL A WEIRD MYSTERY! SO WHO'S AN EXPERT ON WEREWOLVES? I'M HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS. AND THEY'RE THE SAME AS MY FIRST! LET'S FORGET IT! LOOK, OLD MAN CHANEY RAISES WOLVES, I TELL YOU. HE CAN ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS. HE DOES KEEP THEM LOCKED UP, RIGHT? YEAH, NO SWEAT.[DOG GROWLS] YES SWEAT! [BOTH SCREAM] ARCHIE! OOF! [BANGS ON DOOR] WAAH! [GROWLS] OLIVER, KNOCK IT OFF! [WHIMPERS] YOU'RE NOT LAWYERS, ARE YA? UH, NO, SIR. WE'RE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DOING A REPORT ON WEREWOLVES. WEREWOLVES, EH? THEN KNOW THIS, YOUNG TRESPASSERS, [GASPS] TO TURN INTO A MAN-WOLF, YOU NEED 3 THINGS: A FULL MOON, A PENTAGRAM, AND THE BITE OF A WOLF. BUT TO STOP A MAN-WOLF, ONLY ONE THING WILL DO: SOMETHING TO COUNTERACT THE SILVERY MOONLIGHT. SOMETHING MADE OF PURE SILVER. LIKE A SILVER BULLET. R-REALLY? WELL, THAT'S WHAT I HEARD ON AN OLD MONSTER MOVIE. [LAUGHS] VERY FUNNY. EASY, JUG, HE MAY HAVE A POINT. SIR, YOU SAID A WOLF BITE. ISN'T THAT A WOLF? OH, NO. HE'S MOSTLY DOG. HE CAN'T HELP IT IF HE GETS LOOSE ONCE IN A WHILE. DID HE GET OUT LAST NIGHT, SIR? WELL, AT LEAST THIS TIME, THE SHERIFF DIDN'T HAVE TO BRING HIM BACK. HE COME BACK ON HIS OWN. TOTALLY TAME, YOU HEAR? WELL, THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, MR. CHANEY. SEE YOU AROUND! CASE SOLVED, JUGHEAD! PRAY, ILLUMINATE ME, SHERLOCK. THOSE FOLKS ACROSS TOWN DIDN'T SEE A WEREWOLF, THEY SAW OLIVER! SO, ARE YOU GOING TO TELL THE SHERIFF THAT REGGIE'S INNOCENT? SURE I AM... TOMORROW. I JUST WISH I COULD MAKE BETTY AND VERONICA NOT HATE ME. GOOD LUCK! YOU'D HAVE TO SAVE THEM FROM A REAL WEREWOLF TO GET THEM BACK. GREAT IDEA! AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME! HEY, LOOK! THERE'S A GREAT SPOT TO BURY THAT IDEA. COME ON, JUGHEAD. NAH. THIS SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF REGGIE'S PRACTICAL JOKES. SOMEONE COULD GET HURT. NAMELY ME! THERE'S A TITANIC BURGER IN IT FOR YOU. WITH NO NAPKINS. I'M A SLAVE TO MY OWN STOMACH! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M OUT HERE, ARCHIE ANDREWS. I'M STILL ANGRY WITH YOU. Betty: DITTO. TIMES 2. I WAS WRONG TO MESS UP OUR DATES LAST NIGHT. IT WAS RUDE AND UNFEELING. AND I BEG YOUR SWEET FORGIVENESS. [BOTH SIGH] YOU'RE FORGIVEN. AH. I'M A WHOLE MAN AGAIN! [GROANS] ARRGH! [GROWLS] [HOWLS] [ALL GASP] DID YOU HEAR THAT? LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! I AGREE! THE SHERIFF SAYS THERE MIGHT REALLY BE A WEREWOLF LOOSE! YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WHEN THE MOON IS FULL, WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIL CAN CRAWL FROM A MAN'S SOUL? Veronica and Betty: THAT'S NOT FUNNY, ARCHIE! WHO'S JOKING?[GROWLS] TERROR WALKS THE STREETS TONIGHT. I SAID, "TERROR WALKS THE STREETS TONIGHT!" [GROWLS] [ALL SCREAM] [GROWLS] STAY BEHIND ME, GIRLS! I'LL HANDLE THIS BRUTE! BE GONE, DEMON SPAWN. [GROWLS]WAAH! OOF! ARCHIE! PTUI. HEY, JUGGIE, NOT SO ROUGH. PTUI. SORRY I'M LATE, ARCH. I LOST THE RUBBER MASK AND GLOVES. [GULPS] IF YOU'RE NOT HIM, THEN WHO IS HE?! GRR! UH, REGGIE? [GROWLS] ONE OF US SHOULD GET THE GIRLS TO THE CAR, WHILE THE OTHER DISTRACTS THE MONSTER. GOOD PLAN. SEE YA! HUH?WAIT! AREN'T YOU GOING TO VOLUNTEER TO STAY BEHIND? SORRY, I'M ALLERGIC TO FUR AND HAVING MY LEGS RIPPED OFF. BYE! RUN![GASP] [GROWLS] NO! THIS WAY! COME ON, UGLY, CHASE ME! [GASPS] HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO TURN THE KNOB WITH THOSE LONG CLAWS! YEOW! AAH! [PANTING] WHO-O-A! OOF! HUH? WAAH! [QUICK BREATHS] Jughead: ARCHIE, HOP ON!HUH? YOW! FASTER, JUGHEAD! I'M FLOORING IT! GO, GO! [GROWLS] [GROWLS] ARCHIE, WHERE ARE YOU HURT? SHOULD I KISS IT AND MAKE IT BETTER? UH, I THINK I'LL PASS. LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T QUITE SOLVED THIS MYSTERY YET, ARCH. YEAH. OLD MAN CHANEY'S DOG IS INNOCENT. THERE REALLY IS A WEREWOLF! BUT WHO IS IT? WELL, IT'S NOT YOU. AND IT'S NOT YOU. THOUGH YOU DO WOLF YOUR FOOD DOWN. [CHOMPS] I'M A GROWING BOY! [GULPS] COULD IT BE PRINCIPAL WEATHERBY? NOT! HOW ABOUT POP TATE? NEGATIVE! MOOSE MASON? NAH, TOO BIG. IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE ELSE! THANKS FOR HANGING ME OUT TO DRY YESTERDAY, ANDREWS. THE SHERIFF DIDN'T LET ME GO UNTIL DINNER TIME. YOU MEAN, YOU WERE FREE LAST NIGHT? HOW ABOUT REGGIE? RIGHT SIZE, RIGHT BUILD, RIGHT JACKET. WHAT ARE YOU BABBLING ABOUT? REG! YOU MIGHT BE THE WEREWOLF! UH-HUH, RIGHT. CHANGE YOUR NAME TO JIM CARREY AND MAKE ME LAUGH. NAAH! THIS IS NO PRANK! HOW'D YOUR JACKET GET RIPPED UP? I, UH, DON'T KNOW. I WENT TO BED EARLY WITH A HEADACHE, AND WHEN I WOKE UP, MY JACKET WAS TORN AND LYING ON THE FRONT PORCH. DON'T YOU SEE? WHEN THE MOON ROSE, YOU BLACKED OUT, AND TURNED INTO THE WEREWOLF! THE SAME WEREWOLF WHO ATTACKED US LAST NIGHT IN THAT SAME JACKET! I ATTACKED YOU? COOL! NOT COOL! YOU ALMOST HURT BETTY AND VERONICA. WHOA! IF I HURT THEM, THEY'D NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN. TOO TRUE! YOU'RE A MENACE, MANTLE! OH, BROTHER! YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT! ARCHIE! WHAT SHOULD I DO?! [SIGHS] THANKS, SHERIFF. I FEEL MUCH BETTER. OK. BUT I HOPE THIS ISN'T ONE OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL PRANKS. IT'S JUST FOR TONIGHT, SIR. IF REGGIE DOES TURN INTO A MONSTER, AT LEAST EVERYONE WILL BE SAFE. AND IF HE DOESN'T, EVERYONE WILL STILL BE SAFE. WELL, DON'T WORRY. I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. MAYBE WE'LL SOLVE THIS MYSTERY AFTER ALL. DON'T WORRY, REG. IF YOU'RE A WOLF, WE'LL SEE YOU GET PROFESSIONAL HELP. IN THE MEANTIME, CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING? A FACE COMB, A FLEA COLLAR? RAWR! FINALLY. ON THE LAST NIGHT OF THE FULL MOON, THE WEREWOLF WAS SAFELY BEHIND BARS. THUS ENDS ANOTHER OF ARCHIE'S WEIRD MYSTERIES! WELL, JUGHEAD, I SOLVED THE CASE AGAIN! GOOD WORK, ARCH. ONE THOUGHT, THOUGH. REGGIE MAY BE A MEAN, SNARLING JERK, BUT HE DOESN'T EXACTLY FIT THE WEREWOLF PROFILE, DOES HE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, HE'S MISSING 2 OF THE 3 REQUIREMENTS. NO WOLF BITE, AND NO PENTAGRAM. WHAT EXACTLY IS A PENTAGRAM, ANYWAY? IT'S A 5-POINTED STAR! LOOKS NASTY. CUT YOURSELF? NO. OLD MAN CHANEY'S DOG BIT ME LAST WEEK AFTER IT GOT LOOSE. HA HA HA. WELL, HE CALLS IT A DOG, BUT WE ALL KNOW IT'S REALLY A WOLF. WOLF? I WONDER IF WE'RE RELATED? OH, BY THE WAY, REGGIE, YOU LEFT YOUR LETTERMAN JACKET HERE YESTERDAY. I MEANT TO RETURN IT. YOU MEAN I DIDN'T HAVE MY JACKET LAST NIGHT? NO. I WAS BRINGING IT TO YOUR HOUSE WHEN IT GOT CHILLY. SO I PUT IT ON TO STAY WARM, BUT... THEN I...HMM. I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. [SHERIFF GROANS] WHAT'S WRONG, SHERIFF? I DON'T...UNH... DON'T...AARGH [GROWLING] [HOWLS] [SCREAMS] HEL-L-P! HELP! HE'S THE WEREWOLF! SOMEBODY SAVE ME! HELP! N-NICE DOGGY. YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME, I-I'M SPOILED. EEK! GO AWAY! I'M TOO HANDSOME TO DIE! HOLY FRIJOLES! ARCHIE! JUGHEAD! MY PALS. EAT THEM! EAT THEM! THINK OF SOMETHING, JUGHEAD! I AM. A PLANE TICKET TO BOLIVIA! REMEMBER WHAT OLD MAN CHANEY SAID? WE CAN STOP THE WEREWOLF WITH SOMETHING SILVER. LIKE A BULLET. WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE, THE LONE RANGER? WAIT! WHAT ABOUT VERONICA'S SILVER CHAIN? Both: WHOA! [GROWLING]WHOA! WHOA! [GROWLS] WHOA! OOF! NO! ARCHIE! YOU DID IT! YOU BROKE THE CURSE! YOU OK, SHERIFF? IS IT TRUE? AM I REALLY A-A WEREWOLF? I'M AFRAID SO, SIR. BUT NOT TO WORRY! I'M PRETTY SURE THAT AS LONG AS YOU WEAR SILVER, YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE BACK. I'LL NEVER TAKE IT OFF. THANKS, SON. IS--IS IT OVER? YES. AND SO ARE THESE PRACTICAL JOKES, I HOPE. I HEAR THAT! WHEN I TRIED TO FOOL BETTY AND VERONICA, IT ALMOST GOT THEM HURT. PLUS, NOBODY BELIEVED THERE WAS A REAL WEREWOLF, THANKS TO YOU. YEAH. PEOPLE LET THEIR GUARDS DOWN. IT WAS WAY TOO RISKY. YOU'RE RIGHT, ANDREWS. FROM NOW ON, I'LL NEVER MAKE UP STORIES EVER AGAIN. Reggie: YEP! I SINGLE-HANDEDLY CRACKED THE CASE WIDE OPEN. SHERIFF LANDON SAID HE'D NEVER SEEN SUCH BRAVERY AND CLEVERNESS. WHAT A JERK! WHY DID I SAVE HIM? [SLURPS] 'CAUSE YOU'RE BETTER THAN HE IS, ARCH. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, EVEN IF NOBODY KNOWS IT. WELL, THANKS. THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE BETTER. BUT IT DOESN'T HELP MY LOVE LIFE ONE BIT. ARCHIE!HUH? OUR BRAVE HERO!HUH? YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT. THE WAY YOU SAVED US FROM THAT WEREWOLF! YOU'RE A HERO, EVEN IF YOU DID LOSE MY RING. BETTY AND I WANTED TO THANK YOU, SO WE'RE BOTH TAKING YOU TO THE MOVIES. Both: MMWA! HEY! ARCHIE'S HOGGING ALL THE GIRLS! WHERE'S MY DATE? [SLURPS] TRY THE CITY POUND, WOLF BOY. Archie: TO THIS DAY, MOST PEOPLE IN TOWN STILL THINK THE WEREWOLF SCARE WAS JUST ONE OF REGGIE'S JOKES. BUT AS REGGIE LEARNED, PRACTICAL JOKES CAN BE RISKY THINGS... BOTH TO YOURSELF AND OTHERS. FORTUNATELY, WEREWOLF PROBLEMS ARE NOW A THING OF THE PAST... IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RIVERDALE.
