 Breathless (2013): Season 1, Episode 6 - Episode #1.6 - full transcript 
 Disappointed over St Alban's Lily tells Charlie that she has met Mulligan and knows he has a hold over the Powells. Charlie explained that, back in Cyprus, Elizabeth was pregnant by fiancé Glen but Otto got drunk one night and caused a road accident, killing Glen though he made it look as if Glen was driving and married Elizabeth for the baby's sake. Mulligan was bribed to keep quiet about it but now confronts Otto at Angela's house where his wife prevents him from marrying off their daughter. After Elizabeth has told him about Mulligan's blackmail she and Otto confront the policeman, who pulls a gun on Otto but is injected by Charlie, who has followed them. Lily, anxious for a child and perturbed that Jean should be on the pill, accompanies her to Margaret' s funeral, where Jean and Richard reconcile whilst Angela's supposedly dead husband returns to her. Elizabeth tells Otto she may be pregnant by Mulligan but hopes that they can put events behind them and carry on with their lives.

 We walk, Mr Cohen, no run. Nurse Wilson. Can you, please? It's beyond me. And me. I thought there was no limit to your knowledge and skill. Are you going like that? I am not going at all. I was rather looking forward to seeing you in your costume. Oh... sausage. Can I be of assistance? Yes. Instruct Nurse Wilson to come to the pageant. We're raising money for an obstetric ultrasound. It will save... You see, Mr Cohen? The Empire has its uses.

 It certainly does, Sister. Oh, isn't this fun! Super. But you wouldn't catch me. You'd look so stunning. My students are here, eager to see the nurses in their... Oh... Not said a word to anyone. Bravo! Please, tell the judges, what is your ambition, Nurse Griffen? Well, it's to marry a... Doctor! - We're doctors. - Not yet you're not. What about you? You promised me you would behave. Chin-chin. ♪ What do you want to make those eyes at me for ♪ If they don't mean what they say? Here we are.

 Congratulations, Dr Enderbury. We are so pleased for you, Lily. A little bird tells me the competition was intense but that you proved yourself the best candidate. To Charlie and Lily... on their future at the Princess Margaret in St Albans. Charlie. ♪ Maybe you'll find you're messing with dynamite ♪ So what do you want to make those eyes at me for ♪ If they don't mean what they say? Thank you, Nurse Ross. Quite charming, I'm sure you'll agree. Next, Nurse Morris will sing for us. Otto, dearest. I'm not feeling 100 per cent. Of course. I'll go and fetch the car. You're not going? Good night. Good night. ♪ I'd like to sip the honey sweet ♪ From those red lips, you see ♪ I love you dearly, dearly ♪ And I want you to love me Nurse Wilson. I wonder... I absolutely rely on Mr Powell. I hope you can understand that. Whatever you may think and I do understand what's been happening I would ask you, please, to... Well... I really rather need him at my side at the moment. Excuse me. OK. Thank you. Angela. Please, you have to leave me alone. You have to stop this now. I'm sorry. Night, sir. It is what we agreed. But she's different. Take me home, please. Mr Powell. Mr Powell. And now, My Lord and Lady... uh, doctors and Your Holiness, it's time to cast your votes for your favourite nurse. Will it be Nurse Welling from Casualty? Or will it be Nurse Tomlinson? Or will it be our students' favourite, Nurse Tutt? Why did you lie to me about the job, Charlie? It's Otto, isn't it? I sometimes think you believe you'd disappear without him. We could have been happy in St Albans, you know that. I'm happy here. What are you so frightened of? Nothing, Lily. I'm not. Then don't walk away from me, please. I love you, Charlie Enderbury. I have ever since the moment I first clapped eyes on you, but... I want us to be happy. We can't be happy here, with you concerned about what everyone will think. Convincing yourself you've made mistake after mistake and... and me sworn to secrets and all sorts with Elizabeth, and Jean. Lovely Jean, but... I sometimes wonder that she just thinks I'm... I'm not sure what more I can stand. What secrets? I should never have mentioned it. It's nothing. Don't look at me like that. Should never have mentioned what, Lily? The... The man. There. I said it. What man? Lily? What are you talking about? What man? What secrets? I promised. I swore on everything I hold true. To Elizabeth? What did you swear? What happened? Lily. That I wouldn't tell anyone. What was his name? You are shouting at me. Mulligan? Sergeant Mulligan? I knew it. I knew it had to happen. What? What are you doing? Phoning Otto. No, please, I promised Elizabeth. Please, I promised! Oh, I can't stand this. I can't. The Powell residence. Is Otto there? No, Dr Enderbury. He said he was going back to the... Oh. Lily, what - I promised Elizabeth. Now perhaps you will treat me like a woman with two eyes and two ears and half a brain and tell me what exactly is going on. Where the hell is Powell when you really need him? Drink this. Assuage the effects of alcohol, so I'm told. Mrs Walker's husband put the car into a tree on Putney Common. Under the influence. Ambulance Service say she's fitted twice, but the baby's heart is still beating. Multiple fractures, facial lacerations... Sir? Right... Yes. Dr Mehta, tell us when we're ready. Ready. Excellent. Swab, please. He's going to destroy us. What I did... What I did for Otto... I always knew... Can't run from something like that. Did you kill someone, Charlie? No. No, me? Of course not. This was in Cyprus. Hot, lovely Cyprus, Lil. The time of our lives. We wanted to celebrate Elizabeth getting engaged. Getting engaged to Otto? No. To Glen. Lieutenant Glen Thorpe. Yank US Air Force. Elizabeth was married before Otto? What happened to him? Elizabeth's fiance. The f... That night we drove to the beach. There was a bar. Probably still there. It was run by an absolute rogue of a chap. But they drank... .. Otto and Glen. It was like a competition between them. You know what Otto's like. Otto doesn't drink, Charlie. He did then. No, what I mean is his confidence. "I can do anything, get away with anything. " No flies on Powell. Things work out. I'm not sure what you're telling me, Charlie. The truth. Isn't that what you want? No, not any more, dear, please. And Otto rolled the Jeep. Easily done... .. if you're a drunk. Glen died instantly. C1 and C2... snapped. We got Elizabeth to a hospital at dawn. Small place run by nuns. She was going to be all right... .. and we thought, I suppose, no more about it. No, I thought about it every day. Every day ever since. But what has that man got to do with it? Mulligan was a sergeant in the military police. When they found the Jeep... .. and the body... .. he started asking questions. It was simple. He wanted answers. And Otto paid him off. He bribed him. Is Nurse Wilson here? She asked me to tell you not... Please! Mr Powell! Angela, please, I'm... I'm sorry. I promise. I never meant - Never meant what? What exactly? For things to get like this. For your wife to get involved, do you mean? Look, I don't mean you or Elizabeth any harm. You have power over everything but not me. Understand? I want you. I want to be with you. Nothing is simple like that. I can't just... Look... It could... be simple. Do you think you just turned over a stone and there I was... .. ready to be discovered by you? No. Of course I don't. You don't know anything about me. I'm sorry, I can't. I won't. Just imagine for one... .. tiny moment that... .. everything was simple. This moment. Here... .. now. But... But it's not like that. It's too... No. Please, Otto. You have to go. Tomorrow morning, then. Just give me some time to explain. I'm on mornings. It's all right. Later. Four. Meet me at the Regency Cafe. Please. Please. Police! Can you open the door, please? The door! They are at the door. For heaven's sake, they have come. Jeannie! Angela! For heaven's sake, they have come. Richie? Do we have a foetal heartbeat? Yes, but it's getting very fast. Mother is hypotensive. We're going to lose her. We're not losing anyone tonight. Gentlemen, I'm going to get this baby out now. Knife. Can this be cut, please? Inspector Thompson. You are the last person I expected to come across in a place like this, pal. I'm visiting a friend. As long as you're within the law. I don't want trouble, Harry. I just want to see that Maureen is safe. Mother. I was only doing what I thought was best. I know. I wanted you safely married. Ron. I'll speak to him, Beatty. You have come, I see, mob-handed, Thompson. All to track down my little Maureen. We had word she was at this address. I told you, dearest, that I would find her. I assured you of that. Sergeant Mulligan. As was, Dr Powell. Chief Inspector now. I was interrogating Powell as to his purpose here, sir. Thompson's zealotry appears to have led me back to you. Up a dusty road. A track. Quite so. I'd like a word, Powell, with you. Thompson has something of a soft spot for Mrs Mulligan. But he's burdened by a sense of right. Unlike you, Powell. We know what you do a bespoke service for women who can pay. No. For those that require it. Oh, your high horse will look very broken when you face a judge. What do you want, Mulligan? The law has never meant anything to you, has it? What do you remember of Cyprus? I remember a shoe. An airman's shoe. And a moved body. No. I remember paying you, Mulligan. Bribing you to forget all about it. You've done very well, haven't you? But the paths we take are so different. Look at you. The drunk who ends up ruling - What is this about? Let me... finish. You cut me dead at the hospital, walked straight past me. So I followed you home. It was when I saw Elizabeth. The white flowers in your home. The way the drapes blew in the breeze. The comfort. Then I realised quite what I'd given you. You're insane. The opposite. I am clear. I stand in front of a man that any jury will condemn. I stand in front of a man who I allowed to escape a heinous crime... An accident, Mulligan. Be certain of this... I will see justice. Enough. It is time you returned to your wife and daughter. You're in no position to give me orders. The only thing you can do is beg not to go to prison. I wouldn't beg you... if my life depended on it. Oh, Mrs J. You should have gone home hours ago. I was worried about Mrs Powell, with you being at the hospital, I... I think you should know about this. Oh, yes. I gave this to Elizabeth as a present. An anniversary. I... I know what you've been worrying at, but... you're wrong. Now, I think it's time you went home and we all got some sleep. All right? I've seen Mulligan. Oh, God. Has he been here, in the house? I need a drink. Otto... please. Don't. The smell is enough. I killed Glen. I rolled that Jeep. It was the work of a... drunk. Then I trapped us here. In this. Nine years, Elizabeth. No, Otto. What you did for me and Thomas was noble and brave. What did Mulligan want, hm? An affair? He has your and Charlie's statements, and photographs. He knows that you both lied. He knows you moved Glen to the driver's seat. Why didn't you tell me? I thought I could control him. Do you think you could carry on practising if one word of what happened in Cyprus comes out? We can start again, move somewhere. What do you think all that money upstairs is for? Maybe living alongside each other like this was... .. is impossible. No. It's... not... .. impossible. But you've changed... .. recently. I will not let you down. What does Mulligan want, Elizabeth? I think he wants me... .. and to destroy you. Hurry up. We're gonna be late. Jeannie? What are you doing here? I'm buying you a coffee. Whether you like it or not. I've got to go on shift. Not now, you don't. You do those cappo-chinos? No, didn't think so. Two teas and a bun. What's gotten into you, Jeannie? You're my sister and I don't give a fig who knows it any more. Besides, it's Margaret's funeral today and I was up half the night wondering where my husband was. So I came down here, I've been upstairs and no-one seems to have seen him. I wonder how long those nurses lasted with their swimming costumes off. Jean. No, I've decided. Enough is enough. Bet you haven't had breakfast either. Your hand's shaking. Ange... I'm fine. I need to get to work or there'll be... Otto Powell is a good but very complicated man. What are you on about? Ange... It's been obvious for months. I'm not... at all sure what to do. Besides, he's married. And, in case you forget, I'm married. And me, too. I'm married but that doesn't seem to count for much any more, does it? You only have one life, Ange. Remember that. Whenever I see Matron, I wonder if I'm in one of those television sagas set in the Crimean War. This is Dr Truscott, Mr Walker. Mr Walker and his parents would like to thank you. Right... Well, all in a day's work. What I did yesterday... taking a drink and then driving that car... very nearly killed the woman I love most in the world. You saved me... and my family... .. and our future, Dr Truscott. For that, there's no thanks great enough. ♪ Funny but it's true ♪ What loneliness can do ♪ Since I've been away ♪ I have loved you more each day Put your tongue away, soldier. ♪ Walking back to happiness ♪ Woopah, oh, yeah, yeah ♪ Said goodbye to loneliness ♪ Woopah, oh, yeah, yeah ♪ I never knew I'd miss you ♪ Now I know what I must do ♪ Walking back to happiness ♪ I shared with you Jean!

Now... ♪ So I'm coming back today ♪ Walking back to happiness ♪ I threw away I suppose I just wanted to stop. Cleaning and tidying. Washing. Waiting. Whatever's the matter? I sometimes think you laugh at me, Jean. I'm not like you. I want to be, you know... easy... every man's... .. and now not at all sure what I am like, or even who I am. You and Dr Enderbury not going to St Albans is good news for me. For all your friends. It's not that. I'm sorry. It's nothing to do with that. Righto. Well, Mrs Enderbury, I think we should start with... .. and tidying. What did you want, Jean? I wanted to ask you to come to a funeral. Gosh. Who's died? A friend. I'm not sure I'd be any use at a funeral. I dunno. It might take you out of yourself. So, what happened, Lily? Nothing. I just got rather upside-down, I think. That's all. You know how I am. Are you going to try for another baby? I'd like you to, you know. I'm on this new pill. Why? I... All I want is a child, Jean. And all I want is a husband I can trust. That's why, I suppose. Where the hell have you been? Listen to me. You remember the military policeman from Cyprus, Sergeant Mulligan? He's here. He's onto us. I know, Charlie. What do you mean you know? Listen to me very carefully. I will handle this. How? How? What do you mean you will "handle" it? I am NOT going to prison. How did you know, old boy? Charlie? I saw him at the hospital, nosing around. Who knows, Charlie? Just you and me, I swear. What are you going to do? Leave it to me. He'll keep quiet. Come in, Mrs J, please. Elizabeth and I would like you to go to the school this afternoon and fetch Thomas. And then we would like you to take him straightaway to your parents. Here's some money. £500. Thomas's protection is the most important thing. In a few days, we'll be in touch. If this is a scandal, Mr and Mrs Powell... Everything we have done... is for Thomas. Oh, God, Otto. That man is... I feel sick. Please. I don't think I can bear that. ♪ Won't you lay your hand ♪ Upon your saviour's breast ♪ Oh, I love you ♪ But... God loves you... Gosh.

I wouldn't put an ambush beyond Powell. Please, Ronald... What is it you want? Elizabeth's told me what's been going on. You bait the hook with her. Ronald, listen to him. This has got to stop, Chief Inspector. Do you hear? The confidence, the arrogance I could never stomach. You have threatened and blackmailed Elizabeth. I've only told her the truth about your lies in Cyprus. Does she know how you go on breaking the law? How your entire existence is based on deceit? What patient in... in their right mind would go to a doctor like you? One word from me and the scandal will destroy you. Then do it, Mulligan. But you will never have Elizabeth. Please... Ronald. No... Suddenly you are no longer playing God. Apologies. The bullet is cheap. But we're all the same dead. Can't you see? Look at him. A man whose hands are soaked in blood. Nothing... when you take away the money, huh, the house... Harley Street. Nothing. Elizabeth... Otto doesn't have a gun. Then he's a bigger fool than I thought. What did you think was going to happen? What are you thinking? What did you want, Powell? For Christ's sake, put the gun down, Mulligan. Whatever it is you're so determined to get, I can't give you. You want my house, my car? Take them, they're yours. But Elizabeth... Take Elizabeth? Don't you understand? She's not mine to give. Your wife? Elizabeth is not my wife. Not in any real sense. Please, just... tell him. Otto... I married Elizabeth... .. because it was the only way I could save the child whose father I had killed. What are you talking about, Powell? Please, Otto. Our marriage... is a pact. You know better than most. If Elizabeth had come back from Cyprus, pregnant, unmarried, what would have happened to her? To the baby? Thomas would have been taken away, adopted, and the shame... No money. A single mother with a growing boy. And I swore... .. that I would protect every fibre of her being. So if you want to take Elizabeth... .. you have to put a bullet through my head first. You came to tell me this? You forced Elizabeth to tele... Can't you see? If you kill me... .. dragging away Elizabeth, what do you think will happen? Nothing is going to change. I should never have let you go back, then. I should never... Elizabeth... what do you want? Tell me what you want. Please put down the gun. No. No. Enough. Enough. Policemen saw us together yesterday. They will come after you. You made me do this. Ronald... I understand you. I felt it the first... first day. And again, even when... I lost Thomas's father in an instant and my future changed completely. We're the same. You... me. Even Otto. But we go on, Ronald. It's what we must do. Make the gun safe, Mulligan... .. and it ends here. What have I done? What have I become? Ronald... Ronald... Charlie! Charlie? He was going to kill you, Otto. What was it? Pentothal. From the bag. How much did you use, Charlie? For Christ's sake, how much? All I had in the car. You would have preferred a bullet? Elizabeth, there's a pub by the dock. Telephone an ambulance! I was trying to help you. Elizabeth, please! You have no idea what he did to me. Margaret didn't live for men, one step behind "her" man, sacrificing everything for her children. She lived entirely for herself. And it was this that made her burn in our lives. It wasn't her wicked sense of humour or some of the scandals that she was always rather too close to. But a woman who knows, as Margaret knew, how to live... may break hearts, may break rules... I'm sorry, Jeannie. What you did for Margaret... .. caring for her like that. I've been such a bloody fool, Jeannie. Jeannie... Come on, you. Come on, Lily. Dearest, I'm home. Joe. I heard from the Cunard office that you were missing. I got into a scrape, that's all. Had to make myself scarce, you know? Angela, you don't wear our ring? Oh... Nurses aren't allowed to be married. I have missed you so much. Ron! Ron? He's not here, Beatty. No. Here. This should help you feel more human. Otto, I'm pregnant. I think. He forced me. Why didn't you tell me? Because I thought you would kill him. So... what should we do? Tonight. No... I meant... I know what you meant. No. Please, Otto. No-one need know. Elizabeth... Stay with me, Otto, please. And tomorrow we can go and fetch Thomas. I'm sure Mrs J could do with a rest. And we could have a little break down by the sea. Mrs J tells me the crabs down there are really quite something. Crab sandwiches in a pub by the beach. I think the weather's set to be lovely. We can go on, Otto. I need you.
