 You've a very important journey to go on, lass. I'm not ready. They're calling for you, Cait. You know what you have to do. For me. For Islene, for us all. Now, listen to me. You are the one. It's you. Now, go. You have made a big mistake here today.

 Send word to the Regni, they can start their siege. It's been four moons. Perhaps we should parley. Parley my balls. From now on, let's say we strike another deal. You keep away from me, and I'll keep away from you. The gods don't deal, Rome. The gods don't deal. Let me tell you something else the prophecy says. You want to know what happens next? I'll tell you. Lokka, in his rage, releases three hellhounds

 to track down the Chosen One. Start trying a little harder, because this is no game. I'm not strong enough. Whatever was supposed to happen, it's not going to happen because of me. Take me to the Underworld. Fuck... I was wrong. Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK The Samhain moon was loud last night. The higher I flew, the louder it spoke. What did the moon say? The invader must have his victories. They will make him drunk with glory. What's that? This... This is our only hope. Who are you?

Vitus! Since we've landed, you've shown courage, wisdom, alacrity... and because of the unfortunate disappearance of our erstwhile Praefectus, I am promoting you to that rank. Congratulations. Follow me. Thank you... General. General Aulus, welcome. Ah, you seem happy today. I hear the Cantii are eating straw and rat shit. Cheers a girl up no end. Yeah, the smell of victory, we like that feeling. Our victory. I never forget when an ally comes good. Where's my pretty boy? Praefectus Lucius Validus is no longer with us. May I introduce our new Praefectus, Vitus. Shame. I was rather lining him up to seal the alliance. What happened? He'd not been himself for some time. Likely a dose of Cairo clap did for him. Oh, near miss for me, then. Yeah, don't make Vitus kiss your feet. It's his first day. Don't worry. I'll break him in gently. When the siege breaks, it will be a new world for the Regni. Which is why I requested your charming company today. I, uh, needed to clarify terms of surrender. The terms are simple. I get the fortress, you get the lands. And the Cantii themselves? Your subjects. Under the ultimate protection of the Emperor, of course. Now, you see, that's the tricky part. Our people have ways of doing this. Sacred ways. I haven't won this war until I have blood sacrifice. Go on. 500 Cantii heads. Warriors. To please our gods. I thought it was Kerra's head you were after. I am. The gods have their own demands. If the Cantii know this, why would they surrender? If they don't surrender, we behead them all. They'd do the same to us. You and your angry gods... [distant beat of troops marching] What do you think? It'll do. [marching feet thundering to heavy drumbeats] I'd love to see Copperknob's face now. Seems the end is near. Such a short reign. All those fights with your father, and in the end, what changed? You had the chance to talk to the Romans, forge the future, and instead you closed the door, watched your people starve. He would have been so proud-- If you've come to torture me, you're wasting your time. I came to warn you. It was Lindon who burned down the grain store. I watched him do it. You're lying. He's a spy for Queen Antedia. Pure poison. So like daddy. Blind as the night. [Druidic prayer echoes dreamily] [voice struggling as he intones] And now... Hungry? Fuck off. I'm not scared of you, Hellhound. That's what you are, isn't it? Don't you want to know how I know? I'm the small daughter. Me and the horse was hoping for smaller. So you know the prophecy. You're taking me to him, aren't you? That's the truth, isn't it? That's who's paying you. Three things. One, you ever cheek me like that again, I'm going to cut off all this bottom stuff, and just take in this top bit. Two, don't take this the wrong way, I genuinely couldn't give a fuck who you are. No more than the last hundred heads, so spare me how small and how important you are. And three, who says I'm taking you to the Romans? We must make room for everyone inside. Of course, but without food-- We'll send out raiding parties. We are surrounded. We have no choice. They're waiting for us to do exactly that. Anyone goes out there, they'll pick us off... I'll choose some warriors. I'll see what I can do. But it must wait till nightfall. Thank you. Arawn... where is she? Sucellus... has she passed your way? Taleisin... do they sing of her already? If she breathes... show me where. Show me. Gods of air, and river, and dark below, where is she? Of course. Aw, f-- Praise to Epona, our thanks for this meal you have blessed us with. Yesterday, I'm washing outside the tent, this kid squats and dumps one right next to me. You told me. And it wasn't yesterday, it was the day before. These are the only people who the gods speak to. You said that too. Then you shook your head, and said, "Someone's having-- Someone is having a fucking laugh. And I said, "They live simply. They don't pretend to be anything other than spirit, and all the spirit needs is a blanket and food." Four moons, and still he won't speak to us. Starting to worry? Because I am. Nature takes its time. He hasn't even said hello. He barely comes out of his tent, and when he does, his eyes are like this. I bet he doesn't even know we're here. He knows. Oh, what, he makes all the goddesses wait, does he? Doing nothing? You may be doing nothing. I'm busy forging a destiny. Fancy a fuck? Oh, don't mind me. My body is unpollutable until the birth. We're all aware of that, thank you. You can have both of us. Don't take this the wrong way. Same answer as yesterday. Suit yourself. If you change your mind... Thank you. I can't stay here any longer. He knows we're here. Besides, he doesn't summon us, the gods do. Stick a knife in me, you witch! Open wide. Breathe. Hey! Right, go on! Shoo! Not here! Shoo! Somewhere else, go on! King Phelan. King of the Cantii. You a druid? Do I look like a druid? Where's Veran? In that tent, since the summer. But he's busy, not available, so good luck with that, just generally. What do you want? I'm looking for Veran. Who wants to speak with The Second Man? Me. Follow. What the fucking fuck? What is it you bring me? I don't bring things, I sell them. What are you selling? Something I found. Swinging in the forest. Where is it? Nearby. There's a problem. What problem? The Romans. And what did the Roman offer you? Half the Empire, sprinkled with rubies, on a big golden stick. And that's not enough? Depends. On what? On what you're willing to pay. Right now I'm hoping you only look like a stinking penniless beggar. Where is she? I told you, nearby. Alive? Let's hope so. I get it now. I get it. Get what? How it all works around here. How's that? If you want something, if you have a genuine need, a genuine case, then they fuck with you. But... act like you don't need them, and then they're all over you. I've seen them turn into eagles and fly. Good. Because after waiting this long, that is the very least I expect. [bag lands heavily, jingling with gold] She's in the ground half a mile north of here. A stand of oaks where the river bends. I know the place. There's a rock at her feet and a reed at her head. Pleasure doing business. It's easy doing business with the soulless. Yeah, I'm bored now. What if she's lying? She speaks the truth. Wait for the rising moon. The first thing she'll see. It's time to talk. Tell the General that I'll speak with him. Don't do it. Why? Don't go to them. You told me to accept his offer-- He'll devour you. It's too late for talking. They know it's over. What can you offer? Yourself? Is that it? You think that's written here? This girl you say you helped, with the blind father, this chosen one... where does that leave you? A sacrifice to some prophesy? Is that what you want? He'll see you now. Follow me. Enough, child. I am Ania, daughter of Bann and Danu, but I go by another name, a name you know well. My true name is Brenna. I was raised by the Regni, but always knew the presence of my real parents. Now I am with child by the golden-haired one, and the prophecy shall be fulfilled. Prophecy? You wrote it yourself, on the face of my ancestor, 2,000 moons ago-- 2,004. The prophecy tells that Brenna shall be rescued by a golden-haired mortal, and together they will spawn a pantheon to rule the heavens for a thousand years. You would bear gods? If that is my destiny. Do you also accept this destiny, should it be so? I want to know the will of the gods. You, who are thousands of moons old, who have always guided us, shown us the right path, the path to the Divine, tell us, Second Man, are we made of light? We would know your answer. I must speak with the gods now. The prophecy is true... But it's not your prophecy. What? You are not its vessel. It has not come to pass. It may not for a thousand years. I only know this, you are not Brenna. You are not a goddess. You are Ania of the Regni. You lie. Gods never lie. I don't believe you. You lie. You're a liar. The troops are massing. At least let me come with you. No, I must do this alone. Kerra... I've done your tribe nothing but harm. It was me who burned the grain store. I came here not to forge bonds, but to poison. It was the Druids' bidding. The Druids decreed it, and I obeyed. I understand. I took food from your mouth. And saved us one, two moons of vain hope. Will you not have me punished? Those of us who do the Druids' bidding are already cast to the wind. Goodbye, Lindon. It is her. I only came to protect her. Is that the only reason you came? The Prophecy... I need to know. What happens? Veran. Veran... please. Veran! I need to know what happens next. You want to know what happens next? You were right, Father. You were right. Patience, your Majesty. Hungry? These are really rather good. The Cantii surrender. The fortress is yours, on one condition. Oh. And what's that? The guaranteed safety of my people. Not a single Cantii will be harmed. Do I have your word? Well, now, that wasn't so hard, was it? Hmm? All this suffering, all this pain, for months and months. If only your father had listened, huh, seen the bigger picture... But then you and I would never have met, would we? It seems the gods have plans for all of us, wouldn't you say? Do I have your word? There's just one small problem. Your ally, Antedia. You know, I have seen some grim things in my time, but what she's got planned for you... If you guarantee the safety of my people, I will give myself over to her. Well, that would certainly sweeten the deal. Make things easier for all of us. Your people will sleep with full bellies tonight, wake up in the morning to a new dawn. On behalf of the Emperor, I accept the terms of your surrender. With one condition of my own. And what is that? Let me show you... how the Empire really works. Are you watching? What are you doing? Fire! Fire! This way, my queen, hurry. Fucking Roman bastard! Where's Gildas? Archers! Fire! Fire! No... No, no, no, no, no! No... no... No, no, no, no... My boy! No, no, no... Now... one more thing. Where is she? I don't know where she is. You helped her escape. Now, you tell me. If you want her more than these lands, more than this fortress, then that means that she's powerful, she's a threat, and as long as she is out there, you haven't won. You haven't won. Now, this... is your last chance. Where is she? She's out there. If your tongue won't tell me, then I will ask your heart. Go back to hell. Sorry. I've decided to stay. I need to learn. Me too. But not here. Goodbye, Phelan. T-Take care of... I will. We'll meet again. What makes you so sure? I can feel it in my bones. She's staying? Yes. The gods have a fate for all of us. You must find yours. But there is a light in this world. A new light. The flame is small now, and the winds are strong, but it burns. It's out there. Somewhere. It is now your task to find it. If you can find that light, and protect it, and help it grow, it will grow strong. Stronger than Kings. Stronger than Empires... The Age of the Druids is over. This is a New Age, the Dawn of the Cantii. All hail... Queen Amena! All hail Queen Amena! All hail Queen Amena! All hail Queen Amena! The gods are dead. The gods are dead! The gods are dead! The gods are dead... Lie down in the light, Phelan of the Cantii. Lie down in the light. The voices, all singing, as one. Hope is the small daughter of a blind father. I know what happens next. ♪ Histories of ages past ♪ ♪ Unenlightened shadows cast ♪ ♪ Down through all eternity ♪ ♪ The crying of humanity ♪ ♪ 'Tis then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man ♪ ♪ Comes singing songs of love ♪ ♪ Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man ♪ ♪ Comes singing songs...♪
