MY GRANDMA AND MOM ALWAYS DID SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR ME... WHENEVER MY BIRTHDAY CAME AROUND, BUT I NEVER GOT TO HAVE A PARTY WITH FRIENDS AND STUFF.

[ CHUCKLES ] IT'S KIND OF SELFISH, ISN'T IT? IT'S NOT. I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. BY THE WAY, WHEN'S YOUR BIRTHDAY? I MEAN, YOU AND RIN. OH, IT'S DECEMBER THE 27TH. HAVE YOU AND RIN EVER HAD A BIRTHDAY PARTY BEFORE? YES, YOU COULD SAY THAT. SORT OF. SORT OF HOW? SINCE OUR BIRTHDAY IS RIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS, WE'D CELEBRATE BOTH OF THEM ON THE SAME NIGHT. EVERYONE AT THE MONASTERY WOULD COME TO THE PARTY. BUT FOR SOME REASON I NEVER CARED THAT MUCH ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY. HMM. ANYWAY, I HOPE YOUR PARTY GOES WELL. MM-HMM.

HEY, EASE UP ON KONEKOMARU. WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT, 'CAUSE I THINK I MADE A MASTERPIECE. NO. YOU MADE A MISTAKE. I DON'T SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE A PERFECTLY GOOD BIRTHDAY CAKE. [ ALL ] HUH? OH, MY GOD. BIRTHDAY CAKES AND CHRISTMAS CAKES ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT. AND IT TOOK US 15 YEARS TO REALIZE IT. OH, RIN. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THIS THING? [ RIN ] "FROM ALL OF US AT THE CRAM SCHOOL, PLEASE ACCEPT THIS AS A HUMBLE TOKEN OF OUR APPRECIATION." [ MEPHISTO ] A CAKE CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF CHRIST FOR ME? A DEMON? HMM. HMM. AH. WHOA! IT'S FANTASTIC! [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] THANKS FOR WAITING. NO, NOT AT ALL. [ CHUCKLES ] WHOA, YOU EVEN LOOK FOXY IN YOUR STREET CLOTHES. [ BOTH LAUGH ] - COME ON, LET'S GO. - LEAD ON. [ PANTING ] I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING AFTER ALL THE WARNINGS I GAVE HER. [ FOOTSTEPS RUNNING ] [ GRUNTS ] HMM? IS SOMETHING WRONG? HUH? OH, NO, IT'S NOTHING. [ GIGGLES ] SHIMA, YOU'RE WEIRD. - WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ONE? - YEAH, IT'S PRETTY COOL. WATCH IT.

TRYING TO KISS PAKU IN THE MIDDLE... WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? OF THE STREET... WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE? HUH? I WASN'T TRYING TO KISS HER. HE WASN'T TRYING TO KISS ME. THEN WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY ARE YOU GUYS SNEAKING AROUND? WE WEREN'T SNEAKING AROUND. WE WERE TRYING TO FIND A BIRTHDAY PRES... ENT. [ THUNDERCLAP ] I SWEAR IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I SORTA LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG. NICE JOB, YOU DUMBASS. WAY TO GO. I'M SORRY. BUT I DON'T GET IT. WHY ARE YOU MAD? YOU HANG ME OUT TO DRY LIKE THIS? WELL, I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU GET AWAY WITH IT. [ SUGURO ] CHILL OUT. NO ONE'S HANGING ANYTHING. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU'RE USING ME AS AN EXCUSE JUST SO YOU CAN ALL GO HAVE FUN. BUT, IZUMO, YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY. WE'RE DOING THIS FOR YOU. I'M SORRY. THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. I SAID WE SHOULD THROW YOU A BIRTHDAY PARTY, AND I WANTED IT TO BE A SURPRISE. YOU SHOULDN'T BE APOLOGIZING. YOU KNOW, MORIYAMA WORKED HARD TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. SO WHAT'S WITH THE ATTITUDE? IS IT REALLY SUCH A DRAG THAT EVERYONE WANTS TO CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY? NO. IT'S NOT A DRAG. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. [ SUGURO ] THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'M JUST SAYING IT'S UNFAIR, IS ALL. [ ALL ] UNFAIR? ALL THESE MONTHS GO BY, AND NOW YOU WANT TO THROW A PARTY FOR ME? HOW UNFAIR IS THAT? WHAT ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE'S BIRTHDAYS? SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS, HUH? HOW MANY HAVE WE SKIPPED [ ALL GASP ] I'M SURE A COUPLE OF YOU TURNED 16 BY NOW. AM I WRONG? THE OTHER DAY, YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT GETTING YOUR MOTORCYCLE LICENSES. I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU, IZUMO. YOU'RE SHARP. THERE, SEE? I KNEW IT. IF YOU WANT TO THROW A PARTY, LET'S DO IT RIGHT AND CELEBRATE EVERYONE'S BIRTHDAY. OTHERWISE, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT MINE. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. THEN IT'LL BE BON'S AND SHIMA'S AND KAMIKI'S. PAKU'S TOO. THAT MEANS WE'LL HAVE TO GET FOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENTS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S FAIR FOR EVERYONE, SO WE'LL GIVE BACK SUGURO AND SHIMA'S MONEY. THEN-- THEN--- MAN, IS THIS GONNA BE A PAIN IN THE BUTT. HEY, WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT INCLUDING PEOPLE WHOSE BIRTHDAYS ARE COMING UP SOON? WE CAN CELEBRATE EVERYONE'S BIRTHDAY TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE THAT WAY [ GASPS ] I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO SPELL THIS. NO WORRIES. I CAN SPELL IT FOR YOU. YOU READY? UH, H-A-P-P-Y. ALL RIGHT. IT'S DONE. SO DOES EVERYONE HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK? [ RIN ] IT'S READY! MM-HMM. HEY, HURRY UP. WE'RE HUNGRY. DID YOU BAKE THAT CAKE BY YOURSELF? YEAH, I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE 'CAUSE COOKING'S THE ONLY PRODUCTIVE SKILL I GOT.
