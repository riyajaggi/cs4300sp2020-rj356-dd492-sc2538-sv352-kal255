 ROSE: Oh! He has your eyes. But he has your smile. I don't know where that nose came from, though. Hmm. I think he's missing something. Arms. Ha ha! What do you know? He is a she. (GASPS) Jake! How did you... Well, that's... That's awesome. Not as awesome as the real thing. (BEEPS) Ahem! Sorry, Jake. I have to go.

 Well, bye. I'm telling you, it was the most perfect first date ever... Until she took off for no reason. Dude, what's up with the two of you always almost kissing? I'm growing impatient with this. Yeah. How come whenever you two link up, one of you always got to bounce off somewhere? Well, I got dragon business and Rose always has aerobics or something. Uh, Jakey, not to bust your bubble, but if it was gonna happen between you and Rose, you think it maybe would have happened already? Chin up, dude. Maybe you two can hang out more once aerobics season is over.

 Or dragon season. Spud, that's it. Dragon season's never gonna be over. If I ever want things to happen with Rose, I gotta tell her the truth. -The truth? -The truth. This weekend, I'm telling Rose I'm a dragon. Mr. Long, I didn't know you were coming on the school ski trip. What fun this weekend will be. You have no idea. Yi!

GRANDPA: Jake! Get back to work! Aw, man. Ah, chaperone, from the French chape, meaning... If you hoodlums think you can get away with anything on this trip, you've got another thing coming. I did not spend 18 years at Farmersteichen University to baby-sit children on a ski trip, so you will behave or you will be gone! Questions? Looks like somebody forgot to drink his chamomile tea this morning. It's cool. Not even Rotwood's gonna ruin this weekend for me. Uh, yeah, about that. I don't think Rose is ready for the "D" word. But she needs to know the real me. Besides, this weekend's Valentine's day. It's the perfect time. So, what are you gonna do? Slip a Valentine under her door? Yeah. With, like, a cute little picture of a puppy on it. Ahem! Roses are red, puppy tail's waggin', by the way, I'm a dragon. Would you like me to write that up for you? Yes. Say yes. My mind's made up. I waited too long to tell you guys the truth about me. I'm not gonna make the same mistake with... Rose! -Hey! -Hey, I saved you a seat. Enough with the dilly-dally. Take your seats! Hey, hey! Rose-alicious! -Hi, Brad. -So guess what? The Bradster's turned over a new leaf. A leaf of sensitivity and compassion... You know, junk like that. Watch this. (GRUNTS) Whoo-hoo! That's right! The Bradster's not afraid to cry! Yeah! You like that, baby, don't you? (GROANS) Oh, I'll give that guy something to cry about. Attention, students, I hold in my hand the key to your happiness. These are special ski passes issued by the school. You must keep them on your person at all times. -Wait! I did not give... -(KIDS CHEERING AND TALKING) PROFESSOR ROTWOOD: Oh, something broke! No, wait! I think it's just a sprain! (CRACK) Oh, no. It's broken. You know, Jake's not the only one with a hookup to make this weekend. Who you checkin' for, broham? Not who... What. The ski lift is my Valentine this weekend. She's playing it cool right now, but by the time this bus pulls away on Sunday afternoon, she will be mine. Yo, Jake, can you translate Spud for me, please? Spud's never made it on the ski lift. He's kind of... Terrified of it. Not terrified... Respectful. Okay, girl. Come here, gently. Aah! Okay. Terrified. Room 215. This is me. (GASPS) You're rooming with Rose? Not if you don't let me through the door, I'm not. Okay, okay. Here's the plan. You two are to stay up all night giggling and girl-talking about me. Then, in the morning, you'll give me the 4-1-1 about Rose's hopes, dreams, favorite nail polish shade. Yeah, baby, I'm in! Whoo whoo! Uh, uh! Yo, Jake, girl-talk is not my speed, okay? Trixie does not do the giggly-headed, nail-painting, hair-braiding, boy-liking, light popcorn nibbling flim-flam. -I'll give you 10 bucks. -Make it 20, and I'll tape record home girl snoring. Deal! Rose! Girl-hug! Hee hee hee hee! This is me. Hey, look who gets to room with the new, sensitive, softer Bradster. Go deep, rookie! Uhh! And this must be my roo... Whoa! Happy Valentine's day to me! (GASPS) What are you doing? Get out of our room, you weirdo! SPUD: Aah! Medics! Medics! Aah! GIRL: Get out! Uh, Spud, I think you got the wrong room. If this room is wrong, I don't want to be right. -Oh, okay! Ow! -Get out! PROFESSOR ROTWOOD: Per school rules, before you do the shushing of the slopes, we must discuss a few safety guidelines. Now, number one... Always approach the ski lift with care as you... Aah! Already take me down! (SPLAT) What do you call it again when ze broken bone protrudes from ze flesh? What happened to you? I got the wrong room. Speaking of rooms, how's that girl-talk going? Mm, we were... What did Rose say about me? -Well... -She likes my hair, though, right? Does she like my hair? -Well, we... -Shh! There she is! Jakey, I am warning you. Think this thing through. Take it from us. It's not the easiest thing in the world finding out your friend is a... -Dragon! -What? Your snowboard. Oh, yeah. Snowboard. Dragon. Ha! That's right. You still got that birthmark? It's kind of permanent. Hey, I have a birthmark, too! Oh, Spudster, no! You nasty! Ahem! Uh, listen, Rose, speaking of birthmarks, there's something I wanted to talk to you about... Rose-alicious! Oh, hey, you've got a little something caught in your jacket. I got you a Rose 'cause that's your name. That's what sensitive guys do, right? They give girls Roses and junk. Man, I rule at this stuff! I don't know what to say. Whoa! Girls who don't know what to say rock! Whoo hoo! Okay, then. We'll talk later. No problem. We're cool. Cool. Jakey, you gotta stop thinking extra hard about this Rose thing. You don't see Spud going around, being all obsessive over some girl. ♪ We are united ♪ ♪ Together ♪ ♪ We are united ♪ Quiet, Lifty Jr. Daddy's trying to read. Whoa! All right, Spud. Let's cut the chatter and get down to the matter. Mastering the ski lift is all about making booty to the bench contact. All right, come on. Now don't be afraid to put some hip into it. Uhh! How was that? Uh... Your birthmark is showing. Uhh! Whoa! Whoa! -Wha... -(CAT YOWLS) Uhh! (SPUD'S TEETH CHATTERING) Oh, I need a heater! On the up-side, I've mastered the art of snotsicles. (ROARING) Ear of the dragon... HUNTSMASTER: You've done well, Huntsgirl. Thank you, Huntsmaster. You can send the Huntsclan to pick him up at sundown. The Huntsclan? Why should I send them when you're already there? Master, I captured the creature like you asked, but... But nothing. You're not a child anymore, Huntsgirl. Come home with the pelt of the abominable snowman or don't come home at all. (SIGHS) I may be wrong, but I think Abominable over there might be an endangered species. The only endangered species I see around here is you! Uhh! Hmm. White's not really your color. Hyah! What are you doing here, anyway? If I didn't know any better, I'd swear you were following me. Well, maybe I am. Well, maybe you should stop. Maybe you should chill. (GASPS) Uhh! Yo! You forgot your... Ski pass? You! no skateboarding in the lodge! You two, separate! You three, feet off the coffee table! I... Da... I... Oh! Oh, g... Ow, ow, ow! (CRACK) Don't worry. That was just my crutch! -Ow, ow, ow! -(CONTINUES FALLING DOWNSTAIRS) -(CRACK) -That was my leg. So anyway, after she ran off, I found this. Hold fast! Only people from our school have those. Exactly! The Huntsgirl's here on the ski trip! She's one of us! Whoa! Happy Valentine's day to Jake. Roses are red, violets are blue, your arch enemy goes to school with you. Harsh! Ooh! We got a rizz-at in the hizz-ouse. -Now all we gotta do is just set a trap. -That's her! Hyah-oh-ah! (ALL LAUGH) Yo! I don't think attacking mannequins qualifies as a trap, dude. Yeah. I guess you're right. It's not like the Huntsgirl would just be hanging out in the lodge. What do you mean you won't be bringing me an abominable snowman pelt? Don't worry. I have something better. A dragon skin. I'll be slaying it tonight. Hey, did I hear you right? Oh, well, I was... You're going sleighing? 'Cause I love a good sleigh ride! In fact, maybe you and me can go sleighing tonight. See, there's something I want to tell you and... Hey, Rose! Oh, look. I think you dropped something. More Roses for my Rose-alicious! (GROANS) Yo, that fool is going down! Forget him. We got bigger flapjacks to flip. Uh, Jake, I feel the need to tell you that I'm a little disturbed by this plan. I'm more disturbed by the fact that Jake not only owns a leprechaun costume but brought it on a ski trip. What up with that? What? So I overpacked. Oh, gosh, begorrah. 'Tis a sad thing indeed to be a little, lost leprechaun. I do hope a ninja huntress doesn't come upon me, don't you know? Gotcha, Huntsgirl. Uhh! Uh, actually it's just Earl. Hey, are you a leprechaun? Uh, you're just seeing things. It's an advanced stage of altitude sickness. Whoa! Leprechauns rock! Uh, my room now! Yo, Jake, this thing has gone way too far. You're tackling innocent... -What the... -(GRUNTING) Oh! Uh... Hey, there. I was just, um... Getting in a quick, pre-ski workout. Uhh! Heh heh heh! Yo, did you see that? Heck, yeah! Rose is totally buff! -Yeah! -Yeah! JAKE: Trust me, Trix, this plan is foolproof. Attention in the lodge. There's a collect call at the front desk from... Huntsmaster. (HUMMING) Here she comes. Yah! Wrong number, Huntsgirl! Think you can hide under all that padding? -Huh? -Huh? (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Aaah! Yah! -Okay. Maybe we need a new plan. -Shh! So I must have lost my ski pass somewhere. Do you think I could maybe get another? Well, normally I would never allow it, but seeing as you asked so nicely, I'm sure I could allow it. -Oh, excuse me. -Aiiiiyah! Aah! My ribs! (GASPS) Okay, y'all saw that, right? Yeah. Rose's aerobics classes are really paying off. Dude, check it out! ANNOUNCER: Gale-force winds and heavy snowfall will combine to create blizzard conditions. Hear that? Blizzard coming in. The ladies love the blizzards. The cold makes them all snuggly! Ah-whoo! I'm gonna totally make my move with Rose tonight. I got all the junk for romance... Chocolates, candlelight... Let me guess... Romantic music? Are you kidding? These are just so I don't have to listen to her talk. Or you for that matter. What? What? I can't hear you! Uhh! Don't worry about me now, huh? My Teutonic blood allows me endure extraordinarily high levels of pain. What's that, Mother? The chickens are loose again? -Ah! -(CRASH) I've got to tell Rose I'm a dragon before Brad gets a chance to make his move! Uh, Jakey, I don't want to be the one to bring this up, but seeing as you're blind as a bat, haven't you noticed anything strange about the way Rose has been acting? -No. -Denial, party of one. Your table's ready. Repeat game, Jakey. The missing ski pass, the ninja body slam, the pro-wrestler biceps, boy! I'm sorry, Jakey, but Rose is totally Huntsgirl, and I'm not about to let you go tell your arch enemy that you're a dragon. I mean, think about it! Hey, you're pretty sure about this. Too sure! Maybe 'cause you're hiding something! You know, I searched every girl's room this weekend -except yours, Huntsgirl! -(GASPS) Okay, now you just buggin', boyfriend. If I were her, I would have shut you down by now. You can't touch my ninja business! I'm sorry, but it's Rose. Roses are red, Jake wants to hurl 'cause he just found out that Rose is Huntsgirl. Man, you know what? I am good at this stuff! See ya. Oh, yeah, and now for a little Rose-Brad alone time. I'm sorry, Jake, but who you gonna trust? Us or her? Jake, are you listening to me? Yeah. Can we talk about this later? No, we cannot talk about... Ow! All right, okay. But don't come crying to Trixie when that she-witch filets you with her hunt... Stick... Thingamabobby. Roses are red, Spot is afraid, Trixie's ticked off, Jake's getting slayed. You! You've got to shut that down! Rose! Rose-alicious! Uhh! Ding-ding, baby! You've got a ticket for the Brad-o-rail, now boarding at station love! Whoo-whoo! Eye of the dragon! (GROANS) Dragon up! What exactly did I tell you about trapping innocent creatures? Hmm. You don't look so innocent to me. -(SNAP) -Huh? Whoa! Uhh! (GRUNTS) Aw, man! You know what? Forget him! Let him fend for himself out in the snow with a blizzard and a ninja. I'm worried about him, too. Well, come on, then. We gotta get our rescue on! B-b-eh-heh-ha. Where exactly do you think you're going? (SPUTTERS) Cold. There! Jake's footprints! I'm guessing that's where the wings kicked in. There's no way we could walk up that mountain in this storm. Who said anything about walking? -(LIFT CHAIR CRASHES) -(GULPS) Looks like you're mine at last. How long do you think a wooden cage is gonna hold in the American Dragon? Long enough for me to slay you. (INHALES) (COUGHS) Oh, is the big, bad blizzard wind too much for your "wittle" dragon fire? Yo, baby, you're the wind beneath my wings. Yeah! Uh-oh! Oh, oh, oh! Whoa, whoa! Rose! Rose, baby! Where are ya? Come on, don't be shy. Time to par-tay! -Whoa! -Aah! Oh, oh, oh! Whoa! Whoo-hoo! PROFESSOR ROTWOOD: Really, this is silly. I am... I'll be fine. My bones just need time for the healing required. Is there a hot chocolate? Oh! Ow! (GROANS) Hyah! Yo, get off my back, woman! Uhh! Give it up, dragon! -Never! -Fine! Catch me if you can! Uhh! Snowboarding. That's what I'm saying! Not bad! Let's see how you do off the trail! Whoa! Uhh! Uhh! (GASPS) Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! (TREES CRASHING) Hah! Nice moves, dragon. Right back atcha... But you need a pair of wings to really catch air. Hyah! Whoa! Uhh! Hah! How do you like me now? You'll pay for that! Leaving so soon? Stick around a while. Uhh! Uhh, uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Go ahead! Finish the job! The Huntsclan will find you soon enough. Trust me! Actually, I don't. They were right! (GRUNTS) You like it? It's the mark of the Huntsclan. It assures me that I was born to do one thing... Slay dragons! Say good-bye! Ai-yah! (VOICE ECHOING) (RUMBLING) -Aah! -Whoa! Rose! Whoa! Uhh! Huh? What are you doing? Uhh! Uhh! Why did you save me? We're mortal enemies. Or did you forget? I wish I could. Dragon, you saved my life, but that doesn't change my destiny. Any last words? -Eat snow, Huntsgirl! Rrarr! -Uhh! Whoa! did you see that? I did it! I've mastered the ski lift! -(CLANK) -Ow! Another day, dragon. I'll slay you yet. Ain't you gonna go after her? Let her go. I should have trusted you guys all along. Hey, don't even sweat it, Jakey. If you ask me, Rose wasn't all that, anyway. Listen to this. (SNORING ON TAPE) She snores like gravel in a blender. Plus, you should see homegirl's feet. She puts some serious ninja wear and tear on them joints. Oh, and don't even get me started on sharing it back. (MUFFLED RANTING) (CRIES OUT) (SOBBING) (MUFFLED RANTING) Hey, ladies, I'm offering approved rates on the Bradster express. Who's riding? All aboard! Ah-choo! -Ah-choo! -Ew! Weirdo. Oh, here comes trouble. Hey, Jake! Listen, I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to hang out this weekend. Hey, you were busy. So, you wanted to tell me something? Is this seat taken? ♪ And I don't want to let you go ♪ Hi. Hi, yourself. ♪ When we know the time is right ♪ ♪ And I don't want to let you go ♪ Sorry. It is. Yo, where is Spud, anyway? That's right, Lifty. It's you and me together forever! A match made in heav... Aah! (SPLAT) Okay, fine, but for the record, I broke up with you!
