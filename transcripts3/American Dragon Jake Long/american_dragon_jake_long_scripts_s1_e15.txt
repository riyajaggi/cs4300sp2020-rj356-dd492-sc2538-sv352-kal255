 Yo, G, thanks for getting me out of the house. Mom's just straight buggin' over her big catering gig. I tried to go in the kitchen, and she about frosted me. Hey, kid, you still got a little bit. Eh, right there. That should not concern you now, Jake. Keep your mind on the mission. What? My mind's all over this mission. Wh... What are we going after again? A gremlin. These are highly inquisitive creatures who love to dismantle machinery and mechanical devices to see how they work.

 But they're not so good at re-mantling after, so you see the problem. (SCOFFS) No problem. Just tell me where this gremlin is and how bad a smack-dragon you want me to lay on it. You cannot defeat every foe with dragon smacks, Jake. Did you bring the CD player like I asked? Pow! even better! I brought the M.P. Blaster 3000. Fresh and brand new! Hyah! I cannot play this on that! The Hubba Hubba Hula? FU: By luau legend Elvis Kamehameha. It's a karaoke classic. (GROANS) Gramps, you know I can't be seen with music this whack.

 What's this have to do with gremlins? It's the only way to defeat them. Not that you'll be defeating anyone today since you left your CD player at home! Don't have a cabbage, gramps. He can borrow mine. And if you need a cabbage, I got that, too. Yo, Fu, I don't know where this has been. Are you calling me dirty? 'Cause I don't think you want to go there, Mr. Same Socks. GRANDPA: Give me the CD player. Hmm. (HAWAIIAN MUSIC PLAYING) This will have to do. Now, when I give the word, Fu Dog will create a diversion. Then, and only then... Look. There's a train coming. Fu Dog, now! Okay, was now the word? 'Cause I didn't get that e-mail. -Fu Dog! -Sheesh. We've got to work out a hand signal. The old injured pup routine ought to do the trick. Yipe! (WHIMPERING) Look at the poor puppy! Puppy! Puppy! Pull his tail! So where's the gremlin? Is he on the train? Whoa! Hey! He's not on the train. He's driving it! Ha ha ha! Need for speed! (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) He's cool, he's hot like a frozen sun He's young and fast He's the chosen one People, we're not braggin' He's the American Dragon He's gonna stop his enemies with his dragon power Dragon teeth, dragon tail, burnin' dragon fire A real live wire American Dragon Dragon up! American Dragon Oh, oh, oh. Whoa! He's the American Dragon His skills are gettin' faster With Grandpa, the master His destiny, what's up, G?

Jake, you forgot the CD player! FU: Ow! Hey, kid, -that's tail, not a toy. -(CROWD GASPS) But you didn't hear that from me. Heh heh. Woof? (SNARLS) Ooh, hoo, hoo! Sparkle! Ooh, hoo! Gremlins are extremely difficult to capture. Highly evasive and slippery. The best way to catch one is to lull it to sleep with the soothing sounds of soft island jazz. You just have to sing a few bars... No way! I don't want that elevator music anywhere near me. Let's just stick to plan "J." What is plan "J"? (GRUNTING) Crabby little gripper. Ah... Ha ha! Wait for Grandpa! (GRUNTING) Aha! What's up? What's up? (GREMLIN GRUMBLING) Jake, use the music! What the... Bye-bye, boys. Ah! Ooh! Eeh! Unh! Jake! (GREMLIN GRUMBLING) -(GREMLIN GRUMBLING) -Whoa! (GREMLIN GRUMBLING) Oy! (GRUNTING) Hot! Hot! Hot! whoo-hoo! Hot! Come back here, you little... Gingerbread! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, no! It's bad! (GRUNTS) Now what did you do? Aah! (SCREECHING) Bye-bye. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn Ha ha! Ha... Did you see that? We better go. Hurry. At least the gremlin problem is history. Good. Where is it? Oh, it's gone. Huh? You mean it got away? I mean it got defeated. You let it escape? I let it know who's boss. It's still on the loose? Still running, Gramps! Jake! (SPEAKING CHINESE) Ah! What's this? A gizmo! Ha! What up, Pops? Ah-ah-ah! Don't go in the kitchen. Your mom's making mushroom caps for the big wedding she is catering. MAN: (ON TV) This is gonna be the wedding of the year. -Maybe the century. -Cool. I'll be upstairs. What are you doing in my room? Staying out of the kitchen. Wanna hear a haiku? Jake's room is dirty. Moldy sandwiches abound. He lives like a pig. -Out! -Does that mean you don't want to hear the sonnet? How was your mission with Grandpa? Was it fun? Was it dangerous? Did you destroy anything you weren't supposed to? (SIGHS) We never talk anymore. Finally, a little peace and quiet and a little bump in the trunk. -Aah! -(SCREECHING) (SCREECH) -(BOING) -(TELEPHONE RINGS) -(RING) -Uh, hello? WOMAN: (ON TELEPHONE) Hi, is your mom there? MAN: (ON TV) Soap stars Thad and Jasma, who have been married 7 times... Jake, don't get... No! Don't... (SIGHS) I tried. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! I think one of your caterers is on the phone. Hello? Inga? What do you mean, Bjorn isn't there yet? INGA: Sorry, boss. He's stuck in traffic. There was a big accident on the subway. The whole uptown line is shut down. Oh, no! I wrecked my mom's reception! Now what am I gonna do? I can't leave yet. There's still too much to do here! Yo, Mom! I can help if you want. Uh, hold on, Inga. (ECHOING) I can help... Whoa! Heh heh. Excuse me. Pardon me. Oh! Hey, is this butter creme frosting? (SLURPS) Yo, does this thing work? Ooh. -Mom? -Huh? Oh. I was just thinking about the last time you helped me out. Oh, Inga, please! You have to take over until I can get there. I'm counting on you. But that was an accident! You can't hold it against me because I messed up that one time. It was 6 times. Yeah, but it was all in one night. And I'm not holding it against you, Jake. I'm sure you'll be a big help. It's just that, uh... I wouldn't know what to have you... I know! Keep an eye on the oven while I fax a menu over to the hotel. -That's it? -Let's start with that. The mushroom caps will be done in exactly one minute. Congratulations on your new job, Jake. You know, it's okay if you want to ask me for help. I don't need your help. I know. I'll just be right here if you do. Now what has gotten into this thing? (STAMMERING) Ooh! Cook place! Ha! Yah, yah, yah! Food! Good food! Food! Yah! Ha ha! (GIGGLING) Whoo! Okay... That's gotta be about a minute. What the... Huh? What? Aah! (SPITS) (SMACKS LIPS) -Needs salt. -(SPARKING AND HISSING) Hey! Occupied! Hey! (GRUNTS) (DING-DONG) I'll get it. That's odd. (DING-DONG) I'll get it! Honey, are you gonna get that? -Yay! -What was that? It's a gremlin. Help me find it. How did it get here? I don't know, but we have to catch it before mom finds out I let it in. -You let it in? -I mean it got in on its own. Why don't you just grab it? It's slippery, all right? Any more questions? What's it doing to the toaster? Don't! No! What about a mason jar with holes in the lid for ventilation? What? How is that gonna help? What is all the hullabaloo? FATHER: Sweet mother of invention! Grr. Well, look at the bright... Okay, I'll just be quiet. MOM: Jacob Luke Long! Oops. (MUMBLING) Here. Try this. (MUTTERING) Ah, ha! Special on aisle sizzix. Pickled gremlins. Get it? 'Cause now, you're in a pickle. Ha ha! What just happened in there? Your mother's mushroom caps are ruined. Oh, uh, they were burnt. So, you threw them against the wall and destroyed the kitchen? Technically, yes. Well. (LAUGHS) I wouldn't want to be in your shoes right now, little mister. No, sir. What on earth were you thinking? Oh, never mind. I don't have time to argue about this now. I have to load up the car and get to the hotel. Oh, this is turning into the worst day ever! -(DOORBELL RINGS) -I'll get it. At least you're out of the picture. (TELEPHONE RINGING) MAN: (FRENCH ACCENT) Hotel Poubelle. I'm afraid I cannot comment on whether the wedding of monsieur Thad and mademoiselle Jasma is taking place in our grand terrace ballroom tonight. Oops. I said too much. Thanks for coming, Fu. I'd bring this to F's shop myself, but Moms needs my help. Don't worry. I'll get this little guy to the big guy. You just make sure nothing goes wrong with Thad and Jasma's big wedding. After all those two have been through together, don't they deserve a moment of happiness? Aw! Don't they? Uh, yeah. I gotta go. (CRYING) Oh, I swore I wasn't gonna cry in front of the gremlin! (SOBBING) Aw, pretty puppy. MAN: Mademoiselle Long, this is the terrace ballroom where, as you can see, your capable staff is already hard at work. Thank you. I'll take it from here. Hello, everybody. Sorry I'm late. It's ok, boss. We're almost done setting up. Oh, Sven, Inga, you did it! Everything looks fabulous. (FOREIGN ACCENT) We knew you were counting on us, so we didn't want to let you down. INGA: Plus, you could fire us. Let's go ahead and light the tiki torches, then. And I think the cake is a little too close to the karaoke stage. We ought to move that. You want me to help with the cake? No! I mean, uh, why don't you go down to the copy center and see if they got the menus I faxed over? (SIGHS) Jake... Everyone, come quick! The wedding is starting! the wedding is starting! Yay! I love TV weddings. TV ANNOUNCER: On TV, they play star-crossed heartthrobs Jasma Sincere and Thad Wilford Chase. But tonight, hearts will throb for real as they take that unscripted walk down the aisle. (GIGGLES) We love you! They can't see you. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! BOTH: Making copies. Jinx! Another jinx! (COPIER WHINES) Oh! More of me. (SIGHS) Probably thinks I'll wreck the place if she lets me do anything. What the? ALL: It was him! Where did all y'all come from? Egg. All right, that's it. You're going down. Dragon up! -Hi! -Hey. What the? TV ANNOUNCER: The bride is resplendent in a cathedral-length tortoiseshell ballgown. Just like the one she wore in the episode where Thad found out Jasma's baby is really an alien-hybrid implanted by a covert agency. Happy new year! (JABBERING) Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get your autograph. Can you sign my collar? I am such a big fan! -Look! -Let's go there. Uh-uh! You don't gets no cake, boy. Huh? Test, test, test. Lookin' at you. Raise 'em up. Boo. Boo. What the? (YAWNS) (HAWAIIAN MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING) Oh, the Hubba Hubba Hula Is a hula that you do When you meet a girl-a Who you're gonna love-a, love a lot Oh, my eyes! Oops. Hey, Fu. I didn't hear you come in. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Boy, after 40 years, you think you know a guy and then this. Eww. Never mind that. Where is the gremlin? We must keep it away from any technology. Ooh. Probably shouldn't have brought it to an electronics shop then. He he. Eww. (GREMLINS JABBERING) (INDISTINCT) Ha ha! one down and... 2 million of you guys, man! -Hmm? -Huh? We're missing the "I dos"! Hmm. -Hmm. What's it do? -I don't know. Emergency something. Do something. Touch. (LAUGHING) Oh, and one more. Thanks so much. Now, where was I? Do I take this woman? Do you, Thad... (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Ooh, this can't be good. Nobody panic. We rented the ballroom on the roof for the reception, so let's just head upstairs in an orderly fashion. -(ELECTRONIC WHINE) -The guests are on their way. All right, everybody, battle stations. (ALL GASP) Oh, my. I can totally explain. Ahh... (MAKING RAP NOISES) What happened out here? Yo, Mom, it wasn't me. It was the gremlins! They're pesky. Totally pesky! You brought gremlins to my reception? No! Well, maybe, but not on purpose. Oh, Jake, this really takes the cake. -Aah! Oh! -(GROWLS) Okay, I know this looks bad, but I can fix it. No! You're not fixing anything. You're not helping. You're not touching. You're not even breathing. Do I make myself clear? Huh? Oh... Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, whatever you say. No breathing. Sven, Ute, stop that thing. Inga, you've got 5 minutes to make this place fabulous again. (GROANS) I'm going downstairs to try and stop the guests from coming up. ALL: You got it, boss! And you... (INHALES) (EXHALES) Ear of the dragon! (GREMLINS BABBLING) -I gotta go. -Are we there yet? When are we gonna get there? (ALL LAUGHING) All right, there's no way out. And I'm not playing no more! I want all y'all to surrender now! And... And get in this bag. ALL: Whoo-hoo! Well, that was easy. Ha! That's right. You're messing with the Am-Drag now! 'Cause when I say jump... GREMLINS: Jump! What the... -Whoo-hoo! -Going down! When are we gonna get there? Oh, hi! I'm the reception planner. You must be the happy couple. We are not happy yet. Oh, but they will be, as soon as we get them up to that nice dry rooftop. Uh, that's the thing. The rooftop? It's not quite ready. Oh! Ready or not, I'm not staying in this stairwell one more minute! Come on! But... Oh! Aw, man! This is totally out of control... (ALARMS WAILING) And not in a good way. Aah! FU: You know, I told you we ought to stock more than one CD player in this place, but no! Eh! Just fix it already! -Whaa! Yah! -(TELEPHONE RINGS) Talk to the Fu. Where's grandpa? This is an emergency. Uh, Gramps, Jake-tastrophe, line one. Jake! What's wrong? There's a gremlin epidemic, and I need to know how to stop them. And please don't say The Hubba Hubba Hula! Yes! You must serenade them with The Hubba Hubba Hula. -It's the only way. -That's impossible. There's too many of them now, and they're all over Times Square. I'd have to have a... Big screen TV and a karaoke machine. But even if I had all that, I just couldn't do it. That song is just too embarrassing. Kid, if you don't find a way to do this, you're not the only one who's gonna be embarrassed. This is the worst wedding I've ever been in! And that includes the time I was kidnapped by Amazons during sweeps. Oh, yeah? Heh heh. Well, I'd rather be married on a sinking ocean liner, like I was last season, than listen to anymore of your whining! This is all your fault! I'll see to it that you never cater in this town again! Ever! -But... -Not ever! Fu, I've got to go. My mom needs me. Dragon up! (SOBBING) My wedding is in complete shambles. Oh, every bride feels that way. But someday you'll look back on this and... Oh, no. Whazzup, New York City! Jake Long is in the house! Jake, what do you think you're doing? Making a complete fool of myself on national TV. Well, okay. Good luck with that. This is a very special love song going out to Jasma and Thad and to all you music lovers out there. You know who you are. -Huh? -Huh? Come on, come on, come on. It's got to be here. Yeah! (HAWAIIAN MUSIC PLAYING) Jake, use dragon karaoke! (CHORUS SINGING) Oh, the Hubba Hubba Hula Is the hula that you do-a When you meet a girl-a Who you're gonna Love-a love a lot (YAWNS) Oh, no. Oh, Thad... Oh, Jasma... What? Huh? (SINGING) Aloha oh With a smile, it's an island hello JAKE: Aloha eh Hubba hubba your troubles away It's the song that was playing in that hospital elevator in Fiji on the night we first met. You were there to donate a kidney to your Polynesian half-sister's evil clone, and I was the ex-showgirl who performed the operation when the real doctor fell into a sudden coma. (SIGHS) Do you, Jasma, take you, Thad... I'm going to take that as a yes. That should put every gremlin in the city to sleep for several hours. Call Jake. Tell him he can stop singing now. Huh? What? What'd you say? What? JAKE: Hubba hubba your troubles away -(RAP MUSIC PLAYS) -Check it out! NYC what hows you do ya My name's Jake, And I'm in the hou-ya Volcano's hot, But Jakey-Jake is cooler 'Cause that's the way You hubba chicka-chicka hula baby Ah, Jake, you did it! You saved everything! Yeah, after I messed it all up in the first place. I wasn't going to mention that. And if it's any consolation, I don't think you looked like a fool at all. Yeah, but you're not the one who has to go to school on Monday. (GIGGLES) (ALL LAUGHING) Dragon out! Hee hee hee!
