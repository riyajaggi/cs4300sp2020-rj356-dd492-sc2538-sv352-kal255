Oh, Mal Function. Would that be short for Mallory then? (WHISTLES) Ah, is it just me, lass, or are you sensin' sparks between us?

 What do you think? I think you've fallen for our hunting decoy. We use it to lure out our prey. And despite the malfunction, it appears to have worked. Now hand over the gold, leprechaun. -Oh! -Sorry, baby, But gold-digging definitely drops you a few points on the "hot meter." You're the one about to be dropped, dragon boy. Finish him! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! (BOTH GRUNTING)

So, class, feast your eyeballs on my latest scientific discovery. Uh, Mr. Rotwood... Professor! Yeah! I'm lookin' at your flier, and the only thing my eyeballs is feastin' on is a big red and yellow blob. It looks kind of like my mom's lasagna. My mom's lasagna flyin' and doin' kung fu! Hyah! Hoo! Nein! This is not any pasta! It is a dragon or a sphinx Or maybe a griffin. Maybe. I don't know. And I am ze first to capture one on film, -Whatever it is! -(CLOCK CUCKOOING) But that's all fairy tale, mumbo-jumbo stuff. Oh, yes. It's mumbly-jumbly stuff, of course. The fairy tales. But let me explain to you these three things. Number one, zere is a magical creature loose in New York City. Number two, I am offering a $500 reward for physical evidence of said creature. And number three, and perhaps most important, -it is Professor Rotwood! -(BELL RINGS) Rotwood is trippin' hard. What? Oh, yeah. Totally. I wonder if my mom even knows that her lasagna escaped? The clock's running down! We need a touchdown to win it! TRIXIE'S GRANDMA: Trixie! You and your friends hungry? You want something to eat? No, no, we cool, Grandma! We just tryin' to make a fourth-quarter comeback up in this piece! Trixie, Captain Bierholtz's called in sick, So I'm flying the entire London to Tokyo to L.A. run. -I won't be back until Thursday. -Yeah. A'ight, Mom. Behave yourself. Write to your father And listen to your grandmother. Promise? -I promise. Love you, Mom. -Love you, too. -Bye, kids! -Bye, Miss Carter. Fly safe. Watch out for flying lasagna up there. You hear? TRIXIE'S GRANDMA: Trixie! Where you goin', girl? -I'm right here, Grandma! -Oh! You hungry? -You and your friends want some food? -No! We straight! A'ight, only time for one more play. Hey, yo, Jake, run a deep post. Spud, pick up that red dog blitz. (BEEPING) I'm open! I'm open! (MUSIC PLAYING) -Whoo-hoo! -Yeah! Yeah! That's right! That's what's up, baby! We're the champions of a world that doesn't exist! Whoo-hoo! And the extra point is... (ALL GASPING) Oh, no! Not Mom's Suitton crystal! TRIXIE'S GRANDMA: Trixie! What are you doin' in there? What's that about the crystal? Uh, nothing, Grandma! It's cool! I was just welcoming over my new friend! -Her name is crystal! -Ugh! What, uh... (HIGH-PITCHED) Right! I'm Crystal! Nice place you got here, Trixie! And that Spud is one cool and hot... Ow! TRIXIE'S GRANDMA: Your friend Crystal want somethin' to eat? Mom is going to straight freak! That was an antique, one-of-a-kind Suitton vase. Dad gave it to her on their first anniversary. SPUD: That vase wasn't one-of-a-kind. According to this stamp, It was a limited edition of 100 pieces. Now let's go find another one! Uh, I'm lost. You have exquisite taste. Suitton crystal, 1912. Mint condition. Wrap it up, Jack! I'll take it. Uh, very well. That will be $600 all wrapped up. Did you just say $600? Now, how much if we get it unwrapped? SPUD: 62, 63... We've $16.63. I'm doomed. Doomed! She's getting hysterical! Get a hold of yourself, woman! Just chill, guys. The three of us are friends for life And friends for real. If we put out minds to it, there's nothing we can't do. Yeah! A'ight! You right! Let's get it crackin'. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn (TIRES SCREECH) (HONKS) Oh! SPUD: And 600 cents. That's $6.00 Wait a second. We lost $10.63. I'm doomed. Doomed! She's losing it again! Woman, get a grip! Guys, guys, it's just a setback. So we still need, let's see... Carry the one... Uh, listen... I got an idea. Meet me back here in a couple of hours. Dragon up! (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) Work it. Own it. Now pout for me. Jake, I'm not feeling it. Just take the pictures, Haley. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) And print... And bingo. -(BUZZES) -What? Who's there? Go away! Oh, it's you. What do you want? The dollars, yo. Huh! So, this is where you live. Uh, real nice crib you got here, Mr... I mean, Professor Rotwood. Ah. Well, enough of the pleasant chitty-chat, eh? You have evidence for me, ja? Yo, do I ever. Chika-check it out. So I'd like the reward in cash. It's all about the Benjamins, baby. Yeah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Shame on you, Mr. Jake Long. These photographs are obviously a ridiculous hoax. Say what? Those were way better than that lasagna picture you handed out in class. Exactly. These are too good. No one could get this close to an actual dragon, particularly an amateur such as yourself. Now take this away from my face! Oh, man! Trixie, you're gonna sell your what to science? No, just hang tight. I'm totally on this. Mmm-hmm! Interesting. Uh-huh. Hmm. These are clearly fake! What? No! Those are genuine dragon scales and claws for real. (LAUGHS) You should know better Than trying to fool a trained mythobiologist, Mr. Long. Dragon claws glow in the dark. Everyone knows this. And their scales have the faintest odor of lavender. Lavender? Glow in the dark? That's crazy! They do not! You wouldn't know a dragon if it took a bite out of your butt. You flaunt your ignorance, Mr. Long. Dragons go for the throat and have acute allergies to human "buttockses." What? Aw, forget you. Glow in the dark. (SCOFFS) LEPRECHAUN: Help, help, don't you know. Eye of the dragon. End of the line, leprechaun. So much for the luck of the Irish. (GASPS) Say good-bye, leprechaun. (GRUNTS) JAKE: Not so fast. (BOTH GRUNTING) Don't you ever take a day off? (GRUNTS) I've been dreaming about slaying a dragon since birth. -Well, keep dreamin'! -Hyah! SPUD: We could try back alley turtle racing. Or, uh, pull-it-as-I-go carts. I hear that could be pretty lucrative. Spud, puh-luh-luh-ease. Don't even come at me with anymore schemes. I need paper, cold, hard, loose change. And it ain't gonna just drop down out of the sky and... (BOTH SCREAM) (GROANS) Whoa! That's one big lasagna. Maybe I'm dreaming Or maybe you're dreaming. Hey, what are you doing dreaming about me anyway, huh? Is it dead? It's still breathing. -Breathing fire. -(PASSES GAS) Out of both ends? Wha... Breathing and tooting fire? Hold fast. Come on, Spudinky. Don't just stand there. Grab the head. Not my head, boy! The dragon's! Finally! Scientific log... I will now decipher the mystical inscription On the lost Aztec tablet of Monte Rubio. It says... TRIXIE: (POUNDING) Hey, you! Open up! Ooh! TRIXIE: What up, what up? You in there, Mr. Rotwood? Professor! It's Professor Rotwood. Now what is it? What do you hoodlums want? -We here to get paid! -Believe that. Oh, no, no, no, no. No more hoaxes and con jobs from you little swindlers. Now, go on. Get out of here. Shoo! Run away! All right, Professor. I guess we'll just take this genuine dragon elsewhere. Let's roll, Spud. Wait! Achtung! Stop! Wait. What is that? It's a magical creature. A dragon! Well, heck, yeah. Ain't that what you asked for? (SPUTTERS) I... I... SPUD: That's about as much proof as you're ever gonna get, buddy. Now cough up the cashola, hmm? Well, of course I'm coughing! I'm coughing! I'll get the $500 immediately. Wait right there. I'll go cough. Oh, pop them brakes, dude. Uh-uh. We just delivered you a whole live dragon right to your door. You're gonna have to start talking more bucks than that. Shall we open up the negotiations, dude? Yeah, baby! Now that's what I call bling-bling! (INHALES) Ah! Money smells good. Come on. Jakey's gonna lose his pudding when he sees this. PROFESSOR ROTWOOD: Wakey, wakey, Mr. Dragon. Huh? What? Scientific log... Success at last! I have a quiet, alive, magical creature! How did I... Professor... Uh, I mean... Rawr? I have contained the creature in the back of a specially-reinforced armored car -Of my own design. -(RATTLING) The specimen displays super strength und the ability to fly! However, the legends of dragons breathing fire and all of these things have no basis in factual... Ahhh! Uh, strike that last part. (SCREAMS) Enough with the fire! (GRUNTS) (PHONE RINGS) What? What do you want? Oh, yes. This is correct. Bring all of your TV cameras. I will be unveiling my discovery at a press conference in exactly two hours. -Ahhh! -(FIRE ALARM BLARES) Hot, hot, hot, hot! TRIXIE: Oh, Jakey, you home, baby? Where are you, bro? Ahem! I'm not usually supposed to let friends into his room unsupervised. He's afraid they might find out about his teddy bear collection And the fact that he sleeps with a night light every night since he was two. Man, where is Jake? We gotta let him know that we're gonna have enough dinero left over to buy some new skateboards and all that. Maybe he, like, went and robbed an art museum. Or perhaps he went on some reality show to win the money. Or, you know, I dunno. Shush! Look! TRIXIE: (GASPS) I don't believe it. I don't believe it either! And I don't even know what the heck's going on. The dragon? Jake? The dragon ate Jake? Oh, man. What a way to go! No! The dragon didn't eat Jake! Look at this! The dragon is Jake! I'm even more confused than usual. What does it mean and how does my mom's lasagna fit into all this? I'll tell you what it means. It means we just sold our best friend to Rotwood for cash! I can't believe we just sold Jake out to Rotwood like that! Man, we really are greedy and cold-hearted. I, like, hate us! Come on, yo! Let's make move! We gotta do something! -(DOORBELL BUZZING) -Open up! Hello? Hello? What? What is it? Go away! Listen, Professor. There's been a bit of a misunderstanding. We need our dragon back pronto. Your dragon? (LAUGHS) I don't think so! It is now my dragon, is it not? Now, who sent you? Dr. Van Horn with that hair? Or Professor Becksley? Mr. Bixley Becksley! Look, dude, nobody sent us. We just want the dragon. Look, we'll even give you all your money back. Plus our own $6.00. Nein! I am on my way to a press conference that will make me the most respected scientist in the world! You want a dragon? Here, take this one. -Good day. -Man, why didn't Jake tell us? We all harbor dark secrets. My third toe is longer than all my other toes. Keep that one to yourself, homey. Now, we gotta get Jake some kind of help. Do you think his mom and dad know? -About my toe? -No! Not about your funky toe! Hold up, hold up. What about Jake's grandfather? That old working in the shop business. Big Ernie, hey, listen up. I like the number four jackalope in the fifth race and the... My bad for busting in on y'all like this. (WHISPERING) I'll call you back. Woof woof! -We're friends of Jake. -He is not here. Jake, he's a dragon, ain't he? (CHUCKLES) A dragon? Oh, no! Ah, the imagination of the young, it's like a butterfly in the rain. Jake's a dragon. Well, that probably means you're one, too, right? -Well, I... -Drop the act, Gramps. They know. How are you doin', kids? Ahhh! It's that crazy dog up it! And look, it really talks. Very sharp, sweetheart. Check out the king-size brain on this one. After today, nothing will surprise me ever again. You must understand. Jake's identity is a secret. No one can know what he is. That's just the problem, bud. Yeah. The whole world is about to find out what Jake is... And it's all our fault. (PROFESSOR ROTWOOD HUMMING) Here we go. (TIRES SQUEALING) (BOTH SCREAM) Uh, shouldn't you be the one behind the wheel? I don't have a license. Oh, but the talking dog does. Well, he has a dog license. Hey, huh? Do you mind? The talking dog is trying to concentrate over here. Oh, yeah! FU DOG: Hold tight, kiddies, We're passing on the right! (ALL SCREAM) Keep it steady. -JAKE: Grandpa! -Hold on! Oh, unbelievable! Another one! Take this, Mr. Dragon. FU DOG: hang on! (ALL SCREAMING) (TIRES SQUEALING) (GRUNTS) (CARS HONKING) Hey, stick a sock in that horn! Can't you see we got a situation here? I oughta... I mean... Woof! Sorry. I am off duty. This is yours, buddy, If you can get us to the Hoboken Scientific Institute in 10 minutes flat. -That, plus $6.00 tip. -Buckle up, kids! Six years ago, I was fired from this very institution for my controversial yet brilliant theories on the existence of magical creatures. (BOTH GRUNTING AND GROANING) SPUD: (QUIETLY) It won't budge. Trixie! Spud! Oh, I mean, um...Ahem! (GRUFF VOICE) I'm a big, scary dragon! Rawr! TRIXIE: Kill it, Jake. We know it's you. Now hang tight. We about to spring you, baby. But I... (SIGHS) There's no way. Rotwood's got this truck built like a vault. You guys just better get out of here. -No chance, bro. -We're here for you, Jakey. Friends for life and friends for real. Now this is how it's going down. Listen up. Holla! (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) (TIRES SQUEALING) And so it's time to change the very course of human history und science with one startling revelation! Aw, we're too late! Behold the dragon! Hey, Professor Rotwood, can I take this thing off yet? Hey, what's crackulating, y'all? (GASPS) You! But... But... What have you done with my dragon? No, no, no! Come back! Listen to me! There was a real dragon in the back of this truck! A big, red, nice one, oh, with big eyes! It's true! This is a misunderstanding! This boy is just one of my wretched students! That's one of your students? You mind explaining why you have him locked up in the back of a truck? Well, I... Well, I... Could... I... I think you better come with us. No! Wait! Let go of me! There was a dragon! Oh, it was a beautiful dragon, I tell you! Oh, with such big eyes! I am a top scientist, a genius! Don't touch me! (SIREN BLARES) Oh, thanks, guys. FU DOG: Some phoenix feather, ba-boom! A little Venus flytrap root, ba-bing! And presto! One mind-erase potion. (SHIVERS) There's been many a morning I could have used a few of these. Yeesh. So, what? I just pour this into Trixie and Spud's drink? It will make them forget everything magical they have seen. But they're my friends! I know, but there are rules. The World Dragon Council would never allow them to know. (CALLS OUT) What? Is it the Huntsman? What? Where? Where are they? Oh, keep your knickers on, laddie. I just never got a chance to thank you is all. I don't know how you did it, Jakey. It was nothin'. I used a piece of gold from this leprechaun and he... Well, the... It's a long story. Listen, Jake. Spud and I want you to know something. This whole magical thing... Look, man, we don't care if you're a dragon, a troll, -a unicorn... -Or even my mom's lasagna. Yeah. Point is, we're friends for life, and friends for real, and that's what's up. Whatever she just said, totally. TRIXIE'S GRANDMA: Trixie, what you doin', girl? You hungry in there? You want something to eat? Nah. No, thanks, Grandma. Come on, y'all. Let me give y'all the business of this game real quick. (GAME BEEPING) Jake, what's up? You with us, baby? I'm with you... Most definitely. PROFESSOR ROTWOOD: Scientific log... Begin working on a new theory concerning a dragon's natural ability to shapeshift into human form. Also, keep a close eye on Mr. Jake Long. That's a very nice tattoo. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
