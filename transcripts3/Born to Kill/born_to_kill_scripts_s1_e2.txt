 Born to Kill (2017): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 Following the mysterious death of elderly patient Mr Williams and the theft of his watch nurse Cathy is suspicious of Sam, who spent a lot of time reading to him but Sam feigns grief, allowing Cathy to be suspended for negligence. Jenny is also concerned, especially when she finds the watch in Sam's possession and bars him from the hospital. Her worries increase when Oscar's parents stop the boys from seeing each other after Sam attacks their son for no good reason. She confides her fears to Bill, on a date, where she also tells him that her husband is not a dead war hero as she has led Sam to believe but a convicted murder, soon eligible for parole. Sam meanwhile claims another victim.

 We don't seem to have any - contact details for his dad. - His dad's dead. Even if Peter does get out, you never have to tell Sam. They do take everything into account his psychiatric evaluation, - his behaviour in prison. - My son is still a child. I cannot let that man anywhere near him. Is there something worrying you? No, I'm-I'm fine. Now the final contestant, Sam Woodford, representing year ten. - Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 - - www.addic7ed.com -

 - You were brilliant, by the way. - If you keep practising and having lessons, one day you might be up there with me. Do you think so? You can do anything if you put your mind to it. When you stand up there, high above everyone, just nothing can touch you. Buzz is incredible. I'm sorry for what happened at the party, what I said about your dad. It's OK. Forget it. - Chrissy! - Get the fuck off me! - I'm sorry. - What are you doing?

 I saw you watching me dive. It was compulsory. Oh, so you mean you weren't checking me out? No, I wasn't. OK. If you say so. Shit dive, by the way. I'm 5p short. Thanks. You all right, Jenny? It's been a long time since anyone's asked me that. Really? I owe you 5p. Maybe we could get that coffee. How about a carrot cake? No! Maybe even dinner? - That'd be nice. - Great. - What's going on? - Mr. Williams is dead. They think it was an accidental overdose. Something must have gone wrong with his morphine machine. - That's not possible! - I know, it's a nightmare! You know, I've been on all night, and now Jane wants me to write a report. There's going to be an inquiry and I've got to minute all the comings and goings and I can't find his watch anywhere. You know, I'm exhausted and I can't remember anything. It'll be fine, they'll get to the bottom of it. Oh, I need to speak to Sam. - Why? - Well, he was here last night. What? No, he told me he was at party. No, no, he was here, wandering around as usual. - Can he come in today? - Yeah, - I'll call him, we'll speak to him. - OK. We inherit through the egg of our mother and the sperm of our father. Er, there's nothing funny about that. Come in. Er, Sam Woodford, your mum rang, you need to go to the hospital straight after school. OK. Jason Watson and Francis Crick worked out the structure of DNA... He passed away last night. Was it his heart? It was a morphine overdose. Didn't finish Treasure Island. - I'm going to miss him, Mum. - I know. Jenny, we need to do this. What were you doing here last night? I was looking for you. Why did you lie to me? You told me you were going to a party. I didn't lie. I went to the party, but it was boring, so I left early and I came to find you. - Did you forget I was out with Lisa? - Mum, you weren't at home and I didn't want to be on my own. But that's not the point. You shouldn't be here when I'm not. I keep saying the same thing, this is no place for a child. I think Cathy's right. I don't think you can come here any more. Did you speak to Mr. Williams? No. I picked up my book, like I said. But I didn't speak to him, he was asleep. W-was he making any noises? Nope. He was quiet as a mouse. Are you sure? Sam? Sam? Yes, I told you, he was asleep. I'm sorry Kathy, but you need to come with us. Uh... Erm, I haven't finished my report. Don't worry about that now. Can you cover for me? Be all right. You'll be back before you know it. Okay. Eurgh! Stop! You're not afraid of hurting a snail? No. What about a bee? Bees are important to the environment. You can't kill bees. - What about a rat? - I can't stand rats! Those long tails. - So you'd kill a rat, would you? - If I had to. Maybe see you later. Hey, Chrissy! Where you going? I'm going to see my grandma at the hospital. I'll come with you. - Weird. - It's my second home, I love it. The old man at the hospital, the one I read to... He died. Shit. I'm sorry. He was a real gentleman. I liked his company. You sound like you were close to him. One of the nurses gave him a morphine overdose. At the hospital? Yeah. Can you imagine? To do that to somebody. That is massive. It's meant to be a gentle death, a bit like drowning. Where'd you get that idea from? I wouldn't have thought drowning was gentle. I'd hate to die like that. Why? Cos I'd just be panicking, knowing there was nothing I could do. Maybe at first. But then you'd be calm. No way. I'd much rather be shot in the head. You coming, or what? I don't know what she looks like now. That's her. - Do you want me to come with you? - No. This is where the old man died. - Oh, my God. Really? - Mmm. Wonder if he was awake or asleep? What do you mean? Just wondering how it happened. Sam, what are you doing? Just showing her where Mr. Williams died. That is inappropriate. Get off the bed. Now! I told you not to come to the hospital any more. - I didn't mean anything by it. - This is serious, Sam. Kathy's been suspended. She's in a real state. Well, she's always in a flap. Maybe she made a mistake? But I know her. She's a brilliant nurse. She does like a drink. No more than anyone else. Well, I smelled it on her breath the other day. - It could be to do with that. - What are you talking about? I told you not to come back to the hospital. I really mean it. You're starting to sound a lot like her. And you're starting to sound like someone else's son. Whatever. Sam? Sarah? It's Chrissy. You look like her. - Do you think so? - Mmm. Come and sit down. Last time I saw you, you just learned to talk. - That was a long time ago. - What are you doing? - I didn't know you was coming here. - Look at her now, all grown up. Yeah. - They give you time off school? - Look, I was going to say... Dad made me start at Ripley Heath the day after we moved in. Did he, now? Yeah. He wouldn't let me have a day off. Chrissy, go and wait for me outside. - You trying to get rid of me? - Chrissy. Please? So, she's at school here now, is she? Thinking of staying? You have to put them in school now or you get fined. - You're not having my house. - I don't want your house, Mum. I'm just here to help. It's not a man's job. What about work? The transfer hasn't come through yet. - Chrissy? - She's fine. Look, she doesn't know anything about what happened. I'd like to keep it that way. I don't know what you're - talking about. - Just... Leave her mother out of it, OK? Oscar, can you get Dad from the garage? Dinner's ready. I'll go. Oh, OK. Hey, Sam, didn't see you there. This is amazing. How do you know how to do this? My dad taught me when I was little. It's the kind of thing you pass on, isn't it? Are you teaching Oscar? It's not really his sort of thing. Yeah, I can see that. You could teach me. Well, when it's ready, you two can take it out together. No, I don't know about that. Oscar's not a very good swimmer. He's never been very sporty. Yeah, a nice way of putting it. I mean, come on, Mike, we both know he's weak. Maybe we could go, just the two of us? I don't think so. Why not? Well, you're Oscar's friend. You're not my son. You guys coming or what? Yeah. Well, I found a caterpillar in one of these. - In the green beans? - Now, look, yes, I do remember. - And you blamed me for that. - Well, yeah, you put it in there. - It got stuck in my braces, actually. - Oh, nasty! Don't know what's going on with Sam. He's started disobeying me, doesn't seem to care. I was never like that. They all go through phases. I put it down to hormones. Do you ever wonder what they're doing when we're not there? All the time. I started thinking about searching his room, you know, checking his phone. Every parent does that, and the ones - who say they don't, they're lying. - Really? Well, saying that, I got up to all sorts, and I still turned out all right. I mean, I think I did. You didn't go to Ripley Heath, did you? I definitely would have remembered you. Don't know about that. - I had spots and no mates. - That's my type. I'm... I'm a bit out of practice. Yeah, me too. No, hold on. You like him? I don't know, we only just met. It's early days. Well, I know no one is ever going to replace my dad. I'm sorry it's just the two of us. You never talk to me about him. You know I find it really, really hard. What was he like? Do I remind you of him? No. No, you're nothing like him. You're more like me. There's some... Sam... Just tell me again what happened, Mum. How he died. - When I was...  - I remember I was at nursery. And you were in a car crash, a lorry came out of nowhere and hit you head on, and that's when you got your scar. That's right. Dad scooped you up in his arms and took you from the car. - Well, I never told you that. - But it was too late for him. His injuries were fatal. His heart was failing. He collapsed on the cold, wet tarmac and even though he could barely breathe, he still managed to tell you how much he loved me. - To keep me safe. - That is not what happened. - I'm going to bed. - No, Mum. - I want to hear about him! - Night, Sam. Sam, don't forget your swimming kit. Sam! I saw you come in, thought we could do some more diving practice. I was doing this game, playing this game, it's a diving game. I thought this game, it might help you. I've been doing these exercises for my arms. I can really feel, feel the difference. You should come to mine tonight. We're having hangers and mash. I don't even... I don't even fucking like you! I pity you. I pity you. I could snap your little fucking neck if I wanted to. Fuck! Watch it. Excuse me? Hi. I'm Lauren. I'm Oscar's mum. - Hi, I'm Jenny. - Hi. I've been hearing a lot about him. I just wanted to have a word about Sam. Oscar came home from school today and he was freezing, he was soaked to the skin because Sam had pushed him into the showers in his uniform. My God. - Is Oscar OK? - No. No, he isn't. Look, Oscar's younger than Sam. He's sensitive. He's impressionable. Yeah, well, Sam's not really been himself recently and I... I will have a word with him. You can tell Oscar it won't happen again. Yeah, to be honest, I would rather they didn't hang out any more. Oscar's mum came to see me today. Apparently you've been bullying him. That's rubbish. - Tell me your side of it then. - He was getting on my nerves, so I pushed him, that's all. Did you not realise how upset he was? You frightened him, Sam. He didn't look frightened. What were you doing? I don't want to talk about this any more. Found it. - Go on. Where? - In the street. Sam, I know it's Mr. Williams'. He gave it to me. - You're lying. - No, I'm not. It was the night he died. But you said he was asleep. It's ridiculous. I don't believe you. OK. OK. I took it. I know I shouldn't have. I was getting my book out of his bedside table, I saw it. I just picked it up. Why would you do that? - I know. I was going to take it back. - You can't go back and say you stole a patient's watch. The police are there, they'll interview you. I could lose my job! Sometimes, he just seems like blank. The other night he was asking about his dad. Does he see much of him? No. I just... - I really feel like I've fucked up. - I know what you mean. I wasn't there for Chrissy after her mum died. I couldn't keep it together. Lost my job. I think you seem like a really good dad. Do you want to get out of here? I'm still waiting on three numbers. Come on. Hi. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. Well, come in. Excuse the house, it's... ... full of old lady shit. Do you mind if I... - You're lovely. - I'm not. I've done something terrible. You can tell me. You can tell me. It's all right. I told Sam his dad is dead. And he's not. Right. So where is he now? Glenford prison. How long's he been inside? 12 years. And he's coming up for parole. And Sam doesn't know anything about him? I couldn't tell him. He was only four when it happened. I... I had to try to protect him. And now he thinks his dad is some kind of hero. Look. Erm... - Maybe we should do this another time? - Is that what you want? No. Oh, God, no. I just... Whoa. How do I look? Really unattractive. Thank you. How weird is it that our parents are out on a date? Are they? They've gone for a drink. I didn't know that. Your mum seems nice. Where's your dad? He died. I'm sorry. It's OK. It's not though, is it? My mum died. People say it gets better, but it's just shit. - I don't bite. - I know. What is it about you? I can't put my finger on it. On what? The reason I like you. Can I just lie here? Yeah. Have you had sex before? I said that I just wanted to lie here. It's OK. Let me show you. Are you OK? - What's wrong? - Nothing. Are you sure? I've got to go. Sam, please don't go. I... I didn't mean to, just... Fuck. Cell 10, let's go. He used to put me up on his shoulders and he used to show me off proudly to everybody. And everybody that could see us, they could just see in his eyes how much he just... Adored me. And everybody that could see us, they could just see in his eyes... How much he just... Fucking adored me. I'm his son. Fuck. Whatever. Hello. Hey, Sam, it's Cathy. Is your mum there? No, she's not. Oh. I wanted to talk to her. I'm being reinterviewed by the police and, well, I've been going round in circles and someone must have used my code on the morphine pump. I just wanted to talk it through with your mum. - I'll tell her you called. - OK, well, I'm... This is really important, Sam, OK? So don't forget. I have to clear my name. - I won't. Don't worry, Cathy. - All right, then, - bye. - Bye. - Good luck. - Thanks. Thanks. Oh, hi, my name's Jenny Woodward. I'm here for a parole hearing. ID, please. Check your bag. Just wait here. Have you done this before? Many times. I'm the prison psychologist. I'll go and get a jar. Peter Shelton is my ex-husband. When I was married to him, he violently abused me and my son, Sam. Peter can be charming and charismatic. He'll say to you that he's sorry for what he did. And that he's changed. Until I met James, I didn't know what it felt like to be loved. He helped me to escape Peter. James was kind and gentle and loving. He was a father to Sam. We were a family. And Peter couldn't bear to see how happy we were. Sam. What are you doing here? Mum's at work. She's going to find you when she finishes. She wanted me to give you these. - Oh, that's kind of her. - I thought they might cheer you up. Do you want me to come in for a bit? Er... Yeah. - Would you like some tea? - Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Just watching some telly. Then combine together to ensure that everything is mixed in well. Can you use any type of cheese? I like cheddar. Can I use that? Most recipes use Caerphilly cheese... I don't suppose you've got a biscuit to go with the tea? Yeah, sure. What do you do next? - I've only got bourbon. - That's OK. - Is that cool? - Yeah. I'm sorry you've been having such a hard time. What do you think happened? I really don't know, Sam. Do you think he could have done it himself? That doesn't make sense. Well, we both know it wasn't you. You'd never do anything like that. You're right. I wouldn't. Who else could it have been? I don't know. I was there. Yes. You were. Now I come to think of it, Mr. Williams did seem a bit anxious. What are you talking about? I thought you said he was asleep. He grabbed hold of my arm. It was like this. He was just digging his fingernails into me. Are you feeling all right, Cathy? W... That's strong. Nice. Now, I'm going to go and run you a nice hot bath. I've had a lot of time to think about what I did. It's something I'll always have to live with. Jenny was right, I had trouble managing my anger back then. I'm a different person now. I keep to myself. I study, and I read and write. Look, I'd like to meet my son one day. Show him I've changed. That I'm not the monster that I was. I'm not a child. You thought I didn't belong at the hospital. I'm not a child. Five, six, seven, three, nine, three, two, eight. Your code, Cathy. Come on. Let's get this off you. What do you want? Please can you give me another chance? I shouldn't have run off last night. I want to be honest with you. Good. It's difficult for me. Show me what to do. Oh. Hi. What are you doing in the dark? Nothing. You look happy. I'm very happy. I want everything to be all right between us. And from now on it will be, I promise. I love you. I love you, too. - Do you want a cup of tea? - Yeah, that would be great. Did you have a good day? Perfect. Have you done your homework? No. I'm going to check, you know. ... Been down the market to get a fake pair of Ugg boots... _ - There you go, Mum. - Oh, thank you. So, how was your day? Yeah, it was good. You were on the ward all day? Uh-huh. Rushed off my feet. - Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 - - www.addic7ed.com -
