 People can't get past the idea of living in an old asylum. Bad things happened here. That doesn't just go away. (SCREAMS) Do you see ghosts? I don't just see ghosts. I see how they died. Trying to get me electrocuted, Uncle Warren? Pity they didn't give you that at the hospital. Might be less bother. Who's that woman? What woman? Sammy never came home last night. I need to be here.

 What are you frightened of? ♪ AQUALUNG: Strange and Beautiful ♪ I've been watching your world from afar ♪ I've been trying to be where you are ♪ I've been secretly falling apart ♪ Unseen (RADIO ON IN BACKGROUND) (TEXT BLEEP) I am popping out for some milk. You're enjoying this, aren't you? Of course. No, I mean - You mean being a dirty bit on the side? Wondering if your wife knows?

 Maybe even hoping she finds out. You were supposed to be a still life. I won't move a muscle. I can include you, if you like. You serious? Deadly. I'm Jed. Sadie. You're good. Oh...it's just part of my therapy, really but... ..it works for me. You've done much drawing? Yeah, erm... ..just as part of my therapy. You got any more? You ever shown your stuff anywhere? Never really had the chance. Been ill in hospital for a long time. Thanks. Well, it was, er... ..mental health unit. This is my first bid for freedom. Yeah, it can be hard getting out of those places. Is that the voice of experience? Yeah. In and out since I was a kid. But I guess they helped me get better but... ..I felt like I couldn't breathe in there. Like I was trapped and I couldn't escape. Actually thought I was dead and had gone to hell at one point. Well, you're out now, so... Yes, I am. It feels really good. Except I don't have any friends anymore. I kind of scared them all away when I was ill. Don't suppose you wanna hang out? Yeah. You can count on me as new friend number one. (BOTH SIGH) I don't think I've ever done it with a landlady before. Don't think I can call myself a landlady. It's not like I own the place. No, but... ..your dad does, right? Yep. It's his baby. I think you should tell him to tone it down a bit. Tone what down? Well, the big spooky pictures and all that bullshit about it being in the family. Don't you think he's taking it a bit far? In what way? Well... ..it's a good marketing ploy, it's very original but... Well, I just think it freaks people Well, it's not bullshit. My grandfather ran this asylum. It's been in the family for 300 years. Don't you think that's a bit weird? I don't care what other people think. I'm eating fine, Mum. Everything's very good. Don't fret. Course I would. Love you too. Bye. (END CALL BLEEP) How did it go? Good. Three more signed,  five maybe Chicken feed. We're doing the best we can. Dad, do you think we're doing the right thing? Well, we got a cracking price on the builders. Poor sods are doing it for next to nothing. Even if it sits empty for a couple of years, we'll still make a mint in the long run. I mean being back here at all. Is that what Jed thinks? No, it's nothing to do with him. Why wouldn't it be the right thing? I just... Doesn't it upset you? Remind you of Granddad? I just think you've been on edge since we moved here. Hey. I'm doing this for your granddad. I'm doing it for you. You OK? No, I...I was... I'm underestimating what a big move this is. It's gonna take a while to get used to being on my own. You'll get there. Maybe I should be sharing a flat like you. I'd much rather be on my own. Why? Just... ..like my own company, I suppose. Just a bit easier. Cos no-one gets it, do they? Yeah. Are you OK? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Do you, erm... Do you wanna come over for dinner tonight? Oh. If you don't wanna be on your own then... You'll like my flatmates. They're cool. The words 'job centre' imply they have actual jobs. Do not be fooled by that. They must have had something. Yeah, two jobs. One in a lap-dancing club, the other in a fish finger factory. I don't know which one's worse. Fish finger factory obviously. Lap dancing's good money. You'd do that, would you? Well, if my circumstances demanded I needed to. Wouldn't you? It's not really my ba but whatever floats your boat. Ignore her. She's a wind-up merchant. Bullshit. You know I'd do it. Like hell you would, Kate. Oh, come on, you'd pay to watch me. Wouldn't you, Ryan? And what brings you here? I've been in hospital for a couple of years. I had a breakdown. But I'm all right now. I can eat my own food and everything. So you two have something in common Has Jed told you he sees ghosts? Well...he used to. And not just pretend. Totally believed they're real. Kate. You're all right now, aren't you, Jed? Has it occurred to you how joking about it might make Jed feel? He's big and ugly enough to fight his own fights. Why make it a fight? Why not try showing a bit of empathy? Good night. And...sorry. No, it's probably my fault. Trying to be honest about - It definitely wasn't your fault. Erm...good night. Good night. (CLATTERING) What's her problem? She's the one that made the scene. Well, she didn't do it by herself. That girl did not help. What did you think of Sadie? Well, you know, she seemed nice enough. A bit full of herself. God, yes, she was trying way too hard. And she was all over Jed like a rash. I know. I didn't even think she'd be his type. What, a bit screwed up and fancies herself (?) That's why Kate didn't like her. Two peas in a pod. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Right, I'm off. You're not going out? I said I'd go to evening mass with Mum. But Masterchef's on in five minutes Go on, God won't mind. Sorry. Isn't it a bit late for a church service? Well, us Catholics do like an inconvenient act of worship. Bye. I knew this would happen from the moment I saw you. I mean, I hoped it would happen. You know, you're pretty great. You're not so bad yourself. Yeah, well... ..I need a bit of practise, to be honest. It's...been a while. ♪ MUSE: Supermassive Black Hole ♪ Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer ♪ Ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan ♪ You caught me under false pretences ♪ How long before you let me go... ♪ (GHOSTLY BABY CRYING) (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) You all right? Yeah, erm...I just had a bad dream. Went to get some fresh air. (VIGOROUS SCRUBBING) You OK now? Hmm. Who are you? What do you want? Hey, wait. I just wanna talk. Hello? Hello? Where are you? Hello? Can I trust you? I need to know. Yes. You can trust me. I need your help, Ryan. How do you know my name? Ryan McAllister, RMC Computer Services. You've lived here for 14 months, is that right? I stole the paperwork. I had to find out who you were. Who are you? I'm Grace. I live here. You live down here? That's right. Do you like it? It's small but quite comfortable. How long have you been here? Oh, years. They've never found me. Not even when they were renovating the place. Fools. I used to be a patient. Here? That's right. What are all these? I need your help. Tracy in 1988. Jane in 1986. Catherine in 1983. And...Jennifer... ..June 1st 1984. It was the last time I saw her. She was my daughter. Somebody took them but...I never found out who. And that's Molly's mate, Zoe. Zoe. They've taken her. I just know they have. It's started again. It has to end. (MOANING AND GROANING) You're up early. I can't sleep. Bad dream. Where have you been? Go on, spill the beans. What's his name? That's for me to know and you to find out. (BANG ON GLASS) (SCREAMS) Sadie? You all right? I...I slipped. Sorry. Right, better get ready for my first day. What's the job? Office dogsbody. Nothing special. Sorry, I really need to get on. I'll speak to you later. Do you want me to walk you there? Oh, no, I'll be fine. Honest. OK. I'll, erm...see you later. (CRIES OUT) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (PANTS) It was a friend of my dad's. Nobody knew. I was... ..really...ashamed. He didn't know I was pregnant. Nobody did. Nobody noticed. But... ..hiding it from everyone was what... ..made me get so ill. What happened to the baby? (SIGHS) I gave birth on my own. On the bathroom floor. It was...horrible and painful. And then... ..when it came... (SOBS) ..it was blue and it wasn't breathing. It looked so tiny. It broke my heart. But I didn't know what to do. I... ..I was in a bad...way. My mind was shot. I was delirious. So what did you do, Sadie? I wrapped it in a towel and buried it in a box in the garden. And now I keep thinking I'm seeing the box again. I know it's the medication. I know my mind is playing tricks on me. You have to get out this flat, OK? Why? It's just not good for you to be here. Trust me. It's... ..it's not that I want you to go, all right? That's not it at all. But I just think you should. I think I'm gonna go to my mum's for a few days. Yeah. Today, right now? Mm-hm. I just need to get cleaned up first (SIGHS) Thanks for your help. I just need a bit of time on my own Yeah. Yeah, of course. Call me from your mum's. Yeah. (DOOR SHUTS) Ryan, I need you to find a patient. I've got something to tell you. 20thC, female, early twenties, had a lobotomy. Died from it. And she probably had a baby. Have you seen a ghost? Is it that girl's flat? She's got a name. Is that where you were? Jesus, Ryan, give it a rest. OK. But you're coming with me. I've got someone to introduce you to. I'm in a bad mood. Bad bad or good bad? Hmm. Both. No marks. I said no marks. You know why. Because she'll see. That's the one. And you'd have to explain yourself. I don't trust you. I know. Scary, isn't it? Just a bit. What if I don't listen to you? What if I was to do this? Aagh! Kate! You're mine now. Not hers. Get off me. Get out! Get out! (LIFT RUMBLES) (LIGHT FIZZES) (THUMP) (SERIES OF GHOSTLY NOISES) (NOISES STOP) (DISTANT CLANKING) (DISTANT BABY CRYING) (BABY CRYING) There was four girls that went missing in a five-year period. Then a big gap. Now Zoe. She says it's the same thing. Look at all this. All these girls went missing when they were here. She thinks they might have been taken by someone. Hello, Ryan. I've brought my friend. The one I told you about. I...I've seen him about the place. Ryan told me your story. I just wanna help. How can you trust him? It's OK. You can trust me. We just wanna help you. Ryan told me you used to be a patient here? Between nervous breakdowns. I never got better until I was released. Why do you think Zoe Fielding was taken? Like the other girls, like your daughter? Girls don't go missing from this place for no reason. It's strange that Bettany's back. What's he doing here? That's what I wanna know. He's...Jed's uncle. Well, he's not my real uncle. Only adopted. Oh, my God. I know who you are. I knew your dear mother. Such a sweet woman. She was a good friend. I think you're mistaken. You didn't know she was a patient here? She had a baby. Died in childbirth, November 1985. They said Caleb Bettany took the baby away. So that must be you. ♪ What's the matter with you? My mother was a patient here. I was born here. Why haven't you told me? It was my idea that Joan adopt you. She could never have children of her own, as you know. She was delighted. You had no right to keep this from me. We were gonna tell you, but when it became clear you had problems, I suggested we put a lid on it. That wasn't your decision! Maybe it wasn't and I understand you feel angry, but you've had a lot of troubles, Jed. It's hardly gonna help if you knew your mother had this... Was cut from the same cloth. You didn't think how I'd feel knowing that my mother had died here Who told you that? The woman in the tunnels. What...what you blathering about? Her daughter went missing. Like all those other girls. What happened to them, Warren, eh? What happened to my mother? Listen to yourself, son. Missing girls? Mad old ladies who live in tunnels? You're never out of loony bins for long, are you, Jed? Just like your mother. Tell me what happened to her? She was pregnant when she was admitted. In a bad way. She died giving birth to you. Poor cow. Still, I'm sure she'll be very proud of you. Chip off the old block. Look where you're heading, Jed. Delusions, imagined conversations. And now you're threatening a member of your own family with violence. (TUTS) Now take your hands off me or I'll have you sectioned just like that. (KEYPAD TONES) '(BLEEP) Hi, this is Jed. Leave a message.' Did you know about my mother? That she was a patient here, that she died giving birth to me? I didn't know that. Sorry. You'd better not be lying to me, Kate. I said I didn't know that. But your dad did. Maybe he thought it was better you didn't know. He's trying to protect you. You might not believe it but he see you as part of this family. Bullshit. I'm not part of this family. I've never been part of this family. I'm just part of the freak show. And you've been happy to play that part You know, you Bettanys are all the same. You do what you want and don't give a shit about anyone else. Give me one scrap of evidence to back that up. All right. Shagging a married man. How do you know? It's pretty obvious, Kate. Yeah, well... What do you care? I don't. We need to go back down, speak to Grace. Find out what else she knows. Do you think Zoe was adopted, too? I think Grace is right. Has it something to do with this place? Everything's got something to do with this place. I think...we've found our ghost. There were three deaths from lobotomies here in the 20th century The other two were men. So it has to be this woman. Elizabeth Smith, 23 years old. Moral degradation? She had a baby outside wedlock. That appears to be the only thing that was wrong with her. They took the baby off her and threw her in here. (TEXT BLEEP) (KNOCKS ON DOOR) Sadie? Sadie, it's Jed. Sadie? Sadie? (RINGING) Sadie, it's Jed. Call me as soon as you get this. (CLATTERING AND CLANKING) (CLATTERING CONTINUES) (WEAKLY) Help! (PHONE BLEEPS) Help! (WHIMPERS) Sadie, where are you? I don't know. You've gotta help me. Please help me. (CRUNCHING) Jesus, what's that noise? Describe where you are. I'm in a...I'm in a box. A wooden box. It's dark... I'm scared, Jed. What the hell is happening to me?! It's all right, don't panic. I'm gonna find you. Jed... Sadie... (COUGHS) Sadie, I'm losing you. (CLATTERING AND CLUNKING) (SOBS) It's no good. (RINGING TONE) 'Hi, it's Sadie. Please leave a message.' (DISTANT CLATTERING) Sadie! (CRIES OUT) Sadie! I'm coming! Hold on! Sadie, stay calm.  I'm here. (SOBS) (WHIMPERS) Somebody call an ambulance now! He was alive! My baby. He was alive. (SOBS) I'm sorry to hear about Sadie's...unfortunate cry for help. I hope she recovers soon. (DOOR OPENS) You have got to see what's happening outside. Ex-patient. Used to hang around the place apparently. We'll do whatever you want. Come and see. A bad man made you do it. (GIGGLING) (SCREAMS) You've got no right to judge me. Well, I know he's got a wife. (GASPS) Aagh! Ella! What's he doing here? I think he killed her. itfc subtitles ♪
