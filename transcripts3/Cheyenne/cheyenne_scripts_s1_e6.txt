 Son. Hold that whip! That man hangs, you all hang. Back away from that horse, boy. Easy. Cheyenne... Marshal, that man's a killer. He killed my son. Let him hang now. What difference does it make? The difference is every man's entitled

 to a fair trial. You don't have to try a man who admits he's guilty! I admitted rustling, but that's all. We know how to handle a rustler and a killer. Most of you men are ranch owners. It's in your interest to support the law. And the law says he gets a fair trial. In Santa Loma. You stay out of this, marshal. Cheyenne, shoot him. Not before I get you. Shoot him. Makes no sense, Len.

 He'll get you too. Afterwards, take the prisoner to the jail in Santa Loma. Shoot him. We're with you, Roden. But not this far. Cheyenne, you and Lou take the prisoner. The prisoner admits to rustling. You say he's a killer. All right, he'll be held for trial. You'll be notified, Mr. Roden. You'll be expected to appear in Santa Loma to press charges. There's only three of 'em. What are we waiting for? No man from my ranch rides against a federal marshal. Let it go, man. The law will take care of the killer. Come on, we'll bury young Ed. I'll bury my own dead. Let's go, Dad. I'll bring him in alone. Why can't I help? He was my brother. He was my son. Well, so am I. I guess we can cut you loose. Maybe he can't lick the three of us. How come you boys showed up at the hangin'? Not that I'm kickin', you understand. We come up here looking for Sam Jethro. Found him dead. Killers don't have many friends. I suppose I'd be wasting my time trying to tell you I never killed young Roden. Save it. A jury will decide whether you're innocent or guilty, not us. Well, anyway, thanks again for what you done back there. Marshal, it'll be dark in about an hour. We'd better find us a camping spot. If you boys wanna sleep off the ground, my place ain't more than a couple hours ride from here. I sure wouldn't mind a roof over me. Maybe I wouldn't either. That's the place where they say I killed young Roden. Cheyenne, go on down there and look the place over. Check the body. Where'd you say this hacienda of yours was? Due west. Two pointed rocks right side of the trail. Just beyond them. I'll catch up with you. You saved his killer. What more do you want? I'm sorry about your boy. So you're sorry. How can you know what it means? He was worth any five men on the range. There wasn't a horse he couldn't tame. Nor a man he couldn't handle. He was everything I wanted in a son. And now he's dead. Shot in the back by a rustler. Let me help. Keep your hands off of him! The marshal's not here to cross you, Mr. Roden. Your son's killer will get what's coming to him. But according to law. I don't want law. I want justice. I want to see that murderer hanging from a limb. Roden! Roden! Well... You wanna keep fighting, it's all right with me. You make it right pleasurable. Let her go. Friend of yours? She's my daughter. Your manners need improving, ma'am. When you want something, say "please." This old coot tried to trick us. I must be getting old, being ambushed by a girl. That any way to treat guests? No cattlemen are guests of ours. We ain't cattlemen, we're the law. Your father's under arrest. What for? For rustling. Rustling? You call that rustling-? That's the charge. Well, now that we're all friends, maybe you boys would like some supper. Mary's a real good cook. If she's as good at cooking as she is at ambushing, what do we got to lose, huh? Only our lives. There you are, honey. It's as clean as I can get it. What about that supper? I'm hungry. I'm cookin', but I'm not servin'. Set the table. Marshal, I wonder if you'd give me a hand... with my last will. Well, I guess you know if you need a will. Roden's had a rope around my neck. He knows my size. He'll never get a chance to use it. You want to make a will, what do you wanna say? Whereas I hereby bequeath my homestead to my daughter, Mary. Well, in the first place, you don't need "whereas" and "hereby." I never heard no legal document yet without "whereases" and "herebys." All right, all right, it's your will. Where you going? To get some liniment, do you mind? Those spurs of yours aren't made of rubber. Where you going? That's a bad cut, you might need help. Now, I suppose we'll have to cook our own supper. All right, Pop, what else? Nothing. Ain't got nothing else. Dark in here. Scared? Not yet. How's the leg? It's...better. I think it'll be all right. Oh, we can't be too careful with a cut like that. My spurs are kind of rusty. You better use that liniment. Oh, I'll get it. I can reach it. This what you wanted? Yeah. Sit down. Pull up your dress. What? Pull up your dress. Higher. Say, that looks bad. It'll be all right. You wanted liniment, you're gonna get it. Ooh, stop. Ooh, quit! Stop! Quit! Why'd you cut yourself like that? Cut myself? I don't wear that kind of a spur. That was done with a Mexican rowel. Why'd you do it? I wanted to get you alone. All right, you got me. Mister, let my pop get away. The marshal won't get mad at you. He likes you, I can tell. That why you wanted to get me alone? You don't know these cattlemen. I do. I've got good cause. The first year, they burned our house. Three years in a row they burned our crops because they don't want homesteaders on the range. Why didn't you go to the law? The law. The law's got no use for homesteaders. We've got to fight for everything we get. All right, so Pop took a few steers. We've got a lot more than that coming to us. Now these cattlemen caught him at rustling. You think they'll stop till they've lynched him? Give him a chance, please. The marshal will see to it that he gets his chance. In Santa Loma. Santa Loma? With cattlemen for jury? You may as well hang him yourself and be done with it. I'll do it. You sure got a one-track mind. Mister, I got nothing personal against you... But my pop's not gonna be hung. Marshal Merrick? Yes. I wou- I wouldn't want them knowing that I'd come here, but Roden has decided you're not to get to Santa Loma. We wouldn't ride with him, so he's lining up his own ranch hands to stop you. You were part of the lynching mob. What changed your mind? I don't want no part of the trouble that comes from a lynching witnessed by a federal marshal. And if I was you, I'd get going. Right away. Cheyenne, pack up. We're leaving now. Crossing the desert in August is plain stupid. Rather have a run-in with Roden? He'll never figure us to take the long way. Wouldn't think anybody would care about leaving a place like this, would you? If you're not guilty, you'll be back. Wanna bet? Roden wants me dead. Son, do I look like a killer to you? They say young Roden caught you rustling. If you were trapped- Trapped? That lad was shot in the back. How do you figure that out? What do I gain by killing Roden's boy? You can see what I got to lose. This old neck, and this place ain't much, but I like 'em both. And there's her. Where do you think you're going? I go with him. Now, Mary, you keep out of this. You can meet us in Santa Loma. I'm not leaving you. Oh, this new generation. Well? If you think you can take it, get your horse. There they are. Hold it. We'll rest 30 minutes. Lou, break out the grub. Yeah, it's about time too. You know, I don't figure Pop killed that boy. Oh? That trial bothers me too. Suppose most of the jury are cattlemen? That ain't our worry. Our job is to bring 'em in. That's all. The rest is up to the judge and jury. I got to figure they'll do their part same as we do ours. You sure got a lot of faith in the law. Someday, everybody'll have faith in the law... if we can keep good men behind these badges. Cheyenne, why don't-? Len. It's not for me. Not as a regular thing. Now, maybe Lou there, you might- Lou? Lou's a gun. Oh, a gun's useful...sometimes, if you can keep it clean and be careful. Sometimes the law needs guns. But the law always needs men. I figure the law's got a man. Yeah, but I'm 58. Who am I fooling? I'm 62. Len. It's Roden. Mount up. Your choice, Merrick: Give us the killer, or you die with him! I'll tell you again, Roden. If my prisoner dies, you all die! That's the law! Think it over. Take cover. Pop, what'd they mean, "killer"? They say I killed young Roden, honey. But I didn't. All right, let him have it! I got their water bag. That'll change their minds about the desert. I want the killer. I'll get him. Give up, Merrick! You're done for anyway! Cheyenne. Another trigger finger would do no harm. You, stay down. Drop it fast. Get your hands up. Get on up there and call 'em off. Move. There's only one man shooting. Let's move in! All right, start talking. Dad, stop! Hold 'em, Dad! Stop, hold 'em, Dad! Stop, Dad, hold 'em! Let my son go! It's your turn to go, Roden! We'll leave! You can have the killer, but let my son go! He stays with us to Santa Loma! That's our guarantee that you won't give us anymore trouble! You've lost one son, you could lose another! Come on. Put the handcuffs on him. Len. Where'd they get you? Son... Get him to Santa Loma. First, we're gonna take care of you. We ain't got enough water now to get through the desert. Water hole. Don't try to talk. He's trying to tell you about the water hole halfway across the desert. I know where it is. You sure? Mister, I get thirsty too. Cheyenne... alone. I want to talk alone. It's all over with me. Don't try to tell me different. Like it or not, you gotta take over for me. Mighty hard thing you're asking me to do, Len. I don't even think he's guilty. I swear you as a deputy. You've gotta do it for me. No matter what you think, no matter what happens, get the prisoner to Santa Loma. I want your word on it, Cheyenne. All right. You'll stand by that, won't you? I give you my word. Roden. There'll be a murder charge waiting for you in Santa Loma. You and your father. Cheyenne. You better come away now. You thought a lot of him, didn't you? I've drifted all over the West, met a lot of men... but nobody like him. I only knew him maybe six months. It was like knowing him all my life. I never met a better man. So now you're taking over for him? It's what he asked you, wasn't it? That's about it. It's all right. I'd rather take my chances with you. It was you who didn't want me to know Pop was charged with murder. He didn't want you to know. I think you know he couldn't have done what they say he did. He just couldn't have- I'm gonna take your pop in. I've got to. I know. I guess I can't blame you. You've got to try to do what the marshal wanted you to do. But I've got to try to save my pop. I guess that's how it is. We're enemies. Only, we don't want to be... Do we? I wish it wasn't my pop that was between us. You and me, we're in the same boat. We gotta stick together. Me and you? You tried to kill me, remember? Well, maybe I made a mistake. Mm. We've gotta do something. I don't wanna go to Santa Loma. All allowing, you've got a point there. What are we gonna do about it? They've got guns. What have we got? The girl. What? She can handle him. They've been out there a long time now. Go on, kill each other off, ha! Leave them alone! Let them finish it! What happened? Who knows. They got in a fight. It was your job to see they didn't. You get the horses saddled. I'll take care of them. You couldn't take care of nobody. Where's your gun? It's here. Lower your gun belt. Throw it this way. I'm taking my father with me. You've got to understand. Well, I guess I can't say you didn't warn me. Like I said, I've gotta try to save my pop. might as well take this with you too. Now we're even. Are we? Ho. Well, it ain't my fault he went lame. You're the big man here. You were in charge. Whose horse do I get? Take the girl's. Double up with your father. Don't tell me what to do. Come on. What if the rest of these horses give out before we reach water? Then we walk. He's asleep, but I'm not. Let me see that watch. It's your brother's. I found it where he was shot. Well, you got no right to that watch. Give it to me. It was my brother's watch. What's his is mine now. You'll get it when I'm through with it. All you need to know about the time, bud, is it's running out. I thought you were asleep. I'll get plenty of that in Santa Loma. What's gonna happen to her if I hang? Pop, shut up talking like that. I gotta talk like that. It's what I'm thinking, and I don't like what I'm thinking. Mister, we ain't in town yet. If I get a chance before we get there to take off... Mary and me is hittin' the trail. So don't you turn your back on me. Less you wanna get poleaxed. Well, being as you so set on talkin', we might just as well be ridin'. On your feet. There it is! Wet, cool and waiting! Nobody drink. It's polluted. He did it. He's poisoned it. He wants to kill me! That's why he did it! My father wants to kill me! Sun's got him. You'll never make it, mister. You'll never make it to Santa Loma. We'll make it. A half a day's ride will bring us to the Guadalupe River. He's right. It's straight south. Guadalupe's on the border. That's your big idea? We're headed for Santa Loma. Well, that's what you say. I say you've had your way long enough. You led us into this. Well, I'm leading us out. We're headin' south. The marshal gave me a job to do. The marshal's dead. Get on your horse. Take his handcuffs and put 'em on him. You had three against you yesterday, mister. Now you got four. When's the last time you slept? You got none yesterday. None the day before. I'm not the only one who has to sleep. We'll sleep in the saddle... one at a time. Just waiting for you to close your eyes for one second. Get mounted. Why, I'm glad to oblige. Sweet dreams, mister. 'Cause the next time you go to sleep, you ain't never gonna wake up. Wait a minute. You ride with me. Why? Why, I'm just thinking of your pop. Your talking just might keep him awake. Might keep me awake too. Lead off, Lou. He can't last much longer. Yeah. I thought he'd cave in before now. When he does, what are you gonna do? Let him close his eyes... just once. Cheyenne, take us to the river. It's only a matter of time till you go to sleep. When you do, they'll kill you. Worried about me? The marshal's dead. That's enough killing. Go to the river for water and then to Santa Loma. Another day of staying awake and I'd never make it. You won't make it anyhow. Roden didn't quit. He went the other way. He'll be waiting for us. If Pop runs, it's like confessing. Then the law would get him for sure. All right then, sleep against me. I can hold you. I had sleep. They wouldn't know. They wouldn't know it, but you would. I kissed you once, remember? Cheyenne. Cheyenne, get up. We got him! This is what we've been waitin' for! Honey, we're free. Pop, what are you gonna do? Pop, you can't. Give me that gun. Don't crowd me. Pop, you can't shoot him and you can't leave him here either. What are you talkin' about? Can't you get it through your head? I'm trying to save your father. No one will argue with me. I'll be boss of the Roden ranch now my brother's out of the way. You ain't much on mourning are you? Pop. Now him. Drill him too, and then we'll leave. What are you waitin' for? You got the gun. Here, take it. Some things a man can't do. You had your chance and let it pass. Like I told you, I ain't no killer. You shot Lou. That's different. It was either him or you. He shot Lou to save your life. Why? Well... I figure up till now, I don't deserve hanging. But if I shoot you while you're down or let him shoot you, I do deserve it. All right, you're the law, mister. Now, you got the gun, what are you gonna do? First, we'll bury Lou. Then- Then then we go to Santa Loma. What kind of man are you? You know he isn't guilty now. You know he's not. He even saved your life, and you're still gonna take him in to be hung? I've got to. But I promise you this: If we make it, I'll do everything I can to see that the law sets you free. We made it. What am I cheering for? For water. Easy, easy. Not too much. Cheyenne! Hold it, or I'll shoot. Get behind the well. Dan, are you all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm all right now. Give me a gun. I wanna get that big fella myself. No, first, we get the killer. Bring the rope. You could have let him go. But no, you're so high and mighty you had to bring him in. Well, let's see you save him now. Let's see the law save him now. It's no use, mister. I don't want her to do no fighting. It's your neck they're after. He's right, Pop. We'll fight them. Get down. That's all! All right, Roden! You wanted to hang me?! Come on, get it over with! No, Pop, I'm all right. I'm not hurt bad. And you ain't gonna get hurt no worse. Roden, the fighting's over! All I'm asking you, as a father, get my girl to a doc! You with the badge, come out with your hands up! Do as he says. No, Pop. You two, get the old man. Well, you gonna be all right, honey. There's somebody in town to get the bullet out. Give me that key. Get me out of these. You could have saved yourself a lot of trouble, mister. String up the killer. No! Roden, I'll tell you again what the marshal told you. If my prisoner hangs, you'll all hang. I'll follow you the rest of my life. That won't be long. Look at this badge. Think what you're doing. I know what I'm doing. Your son's watch. Is the law stealing watches? Take your watch, Dan. This is your watch? No. Roden, I found this where your son was shot. Don't listen to him. I ain't been near that place in a year. I found it where the body was lying. Dad, I loaned it to Ed. He lost his watch, and I gave him mine. You lie. Ed's watch was in his pocket when I buried him. Give me that gun. In the back, you coward! You shot him in the back! It's your fault! You gave him everything! Nothing left for me! Let the law have him. We ain't far from a doctor. I'm all right, Pop. Roden. Well, lawman. I guess I'm the one to go to Santa Loma. You'll have no trouble with me.
