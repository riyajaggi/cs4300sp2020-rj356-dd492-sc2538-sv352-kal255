Cheyenne having what he thinks is a winning hand doesn't leave but the drunk decides to let him stay. It helps the sheriff arrest the town drunk. The three men he was playing cards with want to re-deal the hand but Cheyenne takes the pot as his hand is the winner. When the three men which includes a deputy return to confront Cheyenne, the sheriff has a gunfight with them including the son of a man who owns half the town. The son and deputy are killed. The girl the sheriff loves is in love with the son he just gunned down. Cheyenne who likes the town decides to stay on in the now empty deputy job. When the bank is robbed, the sheriff and Cheyenne give chase. The sheriff catches up with the leader who is carrying the money and accidentally kills him.

 Gus. Yeah, Mike? I want you to close this place. Get everybody outta here. Why, it's only 10:30. What? I said clear the place out. You and your customers don't wanna get hurt. We're closin' up, everybody. All right, you heard him. When you get outside, you can send for the sheriff. Tell him to come in here after me.

 Full of Kentucky courage, ain't you, Mike? I said to clear out. I'll get the sheriff for you personally, Mike. Be my pleasure. You wanna buy a mirror? You waitin' for something? I think I got the winning hand. I'd...kinda hate to leave it. You'll have to. On your way. My quarrel's with the sheriff, not with you. Now, get going. Why don't you let me stay. You don't scare very easy, do ya?

 I'm scared. Drop your gun. Kick it away. I'm gonna let ya stay. I like ya. You know Wes Garth, the sheriff? No. Too bad. Guess you never will now. He'll be coming through that door in about a minute. And I'm gonna kill him. All right, Mike, on your feet. Move! You look kinda sore, Mike. Better get his old cell ready, Wes. Why didn't you leave? He likes me. Give him six months this time, Wes. And keep him outta here. I'll do that. I was about to call that last bet when you fellas took off. Anybody beat aces and threes? We'll play the hand over. I got a better idea. Let's see who won it. How do we know you didn't get them aces out of the deck? Why didn't you stay to find out? I guess you didn't hear me. I said we'd play the hand over. I hear you better this time. It wouldn't do at all for a deputy to get into a shootin'. Let's go, Jimmy. We don't want no trouble. I'm Charlie Peabody. How do you do? Want some friendly advice? You'll be hearin' from them fellas. The young'un, Jimmy Clements, he's a bad boy. They're all bad, all three of 'em. Yeah, I guess you're right. Especially at poker. The boy's been that way now for quite a spell. Noticed it ever since they come out here from back East. Maybe it's 'cause Jimmy's pop owns the Bar X Ranch and half the town. But the kid's always got a chip on his shoulder. He's al- Hear you had a little trouble. No harm done. No, not yet. If you're just drifti'' through town, you'd better drift on while things are still quiet. I'm not lookin' for trouble. You've already found it. Ride out now, and it might pass. Why not tell the others to drift? Maybe because there's three of them and only one of you. Maybe because they live here. Is your horse in the stable? Uh-huh. I'll walk over there with you. My friend here tells me the kid's dad owns half the town. Does he own the sheriff too? Do you have to be carried outta here? Look, mister, I'm meetin' a man at this bar tonight. I did a trail job for him, and he owes me money. When I get it, I'll be on my way. All right, cowboy. Have it your way. But you could become a permanent resident of our town. The kind that never causes me any trouble. All right, Wes, come on in. Why the hat? Aw, you know me. Never take any unnecessary chances. I won't get violent. Good. How about supper? Dining room's still open. I know. I just left there. You ate alone? Why didn't you wait for me? I told you I'd be around. And I told you I wouldn't be. Oh, Claire. It's no good, Wes. I wish you'd go now. Why? I've told you why. What do you want from me, Claire? You want me to crawl? Is that it? I don't want anything from you. Can't you understand? I mean it. You haven't got what I want. And that pink-faced kid has? Yes. It won't work. Clements won't let that spoiled kid of his marry ya. He'll cut him off without a dime. And you're the only woman I've ever wanted for keeps. That's got to mean something. You go on saying no, but this makes a liar out of ya. I know what I want. And you can't gi- Yes? It's me, Charlie Peabody. Wes in there? Uh- Sorry, Mr. Garth, but I thought you ought to know there's gonna be trouble over that card shark. Jimmy Clements and your deputy are up at the Gold Spur, gettin' liquored up and talkin' theirselves into a shootin' mood. There's gonna be gun trouble, sure. All right, Charlie. Thanks. Is Jimmy in some kind of trouble? Good night, Claire. Don't let anything happen to him. Hey, mister, you'd better get goin'. Where do you think I oughta go? I don't know, but you better go someplace. 'Cause here they come. I'll take that. You see those three? I see 'em. Just stay outta my way. That's far enough, boys. Don't try to stop us. You wanna keep that star, Hank? This is a private quarrel, Wes. We're in the right. Not this way, you aren't. Now, turn around and go home. There's a man over there we want. Get out of the way. Don't try anything foolish, kid. You gonna move? No. But you are. Now, turn around and get! I didn't draw, Wes. He's dead, Mr. Garth. When you're ready to leave town, you can pick up your gun. It'll be at my office. Friend of yours? Yes. He was. Came for my gun. Did your man get here? Got my money, and I'm on my way. All right. About that remark that I made to you last night. Forget it. I caused you a hat-full of trouble, uh... I'm afraid my trouble's just starting. You got a lot of gall still wearing that badge. Any reason why I shouldn't, John? Yeah, for making it a free license to kill. I'm gonna take it off of ya. I'm gonna see you tried and hanged! Will you sit down and let me tell you how it happened. Could anything you say make any difference? No. Jimmy'll still be dead. He was only a kid. He was a man, John. All the way. I thought he had backed down. The others would've. Jimmy wouldn't. He drew, and I had to shoot. God, help me. I feel like I killed him. Why? Why should I feel like that? Like I killed him myself. Maybe that's the way every father feels when his boy dies. I should have left here. I should have gone back to St. Louis. I should have married again when his mother died. You know that I sent him back east to school once. He ran away and came home. Want me to ride back to the ranch with you? I'm sorry, Wes. I said things that I didn't mean. I know. There's more to your job than I thought. Maybe that's why I stay with it. Well, I guess I better get going now. Good luck, cowboy. Thanks. Same to you. Thought I was rid of you. I got on my pony and discovered a terrible thing. Didn't know where I was goin'. Does anybody? I do now. Decided to stay right here. It's a good town. Any special kind of work in mind? Isn't there a deputy's job open? Do you think you're qualified for it? I'd like to try. I don't know. I doubt if you're cut out to wear a star. Why? Few men are. Hank thought he was. I knew different, and I was right. Takes a special kind of man. Not a better man, but a special one. Who doesn't have to look to the past to know what to do. I'll watch you. There's no future in it either. Ten years ago, there weren't any jobs like mine or towns like this. And ten years from now, this'll all be changed and forgotten. And you ought to forget it too. Here, the law books don't count. Or the badge either. The whole works is in the man who wears it. Got anybody else for the job? Nope. What have we got to lose? What's your name, cowboy? Cheyenne Bodie. When you find out I was right, Cheyenne, remember I told ya. This will have to do until I get you a new one. Looks like the sheriff's got himself a new deputy. That make any change in our plans? I don't see no reason why it should. Need some help? I seem to. The hinge is loose. If we had a screwdriver, we could fix it. Will this do? Works fine now. Thanks. You're kinda tall, aren't ya? Most of the time. You've been asking about me. Oh? Clerk told me. That's more than he told me. Of course. He's a friend of mine. Shh. What is it, Wes? I've got to talk to ya. Some other time. It's- It's late, and I'm sleepy. You're wrong about that shooting, Claire. Not tonight, Wes. Please? All right, if that's the way you feel about it. You know where to find me. Good night. I prefer it the other way. I need the light to find my way out. Good night. What's wrong? I didn't know you were Wes' girl. I'm not. I'd sure like to believe that. Why shouldn't you? Looked pretty obvious to me. I happen to like Wes. More important, I want him to like me. I can't help the way he feels about me. But if you're anxious to leave, I'm not holding you. I'm not anxious to leave. Tomorrow I'll ask questions. If I get the right answers, I'd like to come back. Morning, sheriff. Morning, deputy. Check the jail? Mike said to tell you he's real sorry. He's only sorry he didn't look behind him. Still like your job? Better than that, I like the town. I've been looking for a place to lay for a long time. I think maybe I've found it. Good. Say, uh, Wes. Who's the girl across the hall from me, room 210. I was wondering when that would come up. Pay her no mind, friend. She's getting married real soon. To anybody I know? To me, naturally. Prettiest girl in town. Whatever it is a particular woman has for a particular man, she's got it for me. She's all woman. Born for the best of everything. Which I can't give her, so right now, we're having a little misunderstanding. Hey, they're robbing the bank. They split up just outside of town. Cheyenne and I each took after a man, and we got both of them. It was just bad luck the third man had the money. Sheriff, a $55,000 loss is more than this town can stand. Every cent I had in the world was in that bank. Same with Charlie and Mrs. Briggs here. Well, why don't we get up a posse. Well, that's all right with me. But where do we start looking? West or east? And who do we look for? A medium-sized man riding a roan pony? I'll do everything I can. We know that, Wes. Well, I got a bar to take care of. I hope my credit's good for a while. Looks like I've got to find me a job. You can have all the credit you need at my store, Charlie. Well that's right good of you, Mr. Harold. I sure wish there was something more we could do. There is. Go to the depot and have the operator send a wire to all the towns in this part of the territory. Tell them to be on the lookout for a free spender with paper money. Door wasn't locked. I decided to wait for you. You know you could get hurt that way. I am hurt. You said you'd be back, and you haven't been. I said I'd check with Wes. Well? I did. Wrong answer. He was lying. I told him I didn't want him. I meant it, and he knows it. I couldn't be lying about a thing like that. I told Wes I wouldn't see him again. He wants me. That's true enough. But people don't often get what they want in this life, do they? I've never gotten what I want. What do you want? I thought I knew until- Till the other day. Who are you, Claire? What are you doing in a town like this? Hasn't anyone told you about me? How I came here? I haven't asked till now. I'd like to- You don't have to worry about me. John Clements brought me here from St. Louis. He promised to marry me. A few months ago, he changed his mind. Then his son. Jimmy was crazy in love with me. He'd have married me. And I'd have jumped at the chance. But Wes shot him. Is that the reason-? No. It wasn't like that. Wes just hasn't anything to offer me. You've got to believe that. Why? Because I want you to. You know I'm telling the truth. But let's get one thing straight. I haven't anything to offer you either. Nothing at all. You really believe that, don't you? It's open. Well, don't be so glad to see me. What is it, Wes? I've decided it's time we stop feuding. We're not feuding. Can't I make you see that? That's what I said. We shouldn't be. Miss me? No. Why don't you give me another try at it. You still don't want me, huh? That's right. I know, Claire. You want the best. And you deserve the best. The best of everything. What if you had all the money you wanted. What would you do with it? Wes, please. I wish you'd go and leave me alone. I just asked what you'd do if you had all the money you wanted. Will you leave if I tell you? If you still want me to. Ever been in New Orleans? No. I grew up there, on Bousseau Street, where the people live in dirty, little shacks and look across the water at the big, white houses. That's what I'd do. Go back home. And live. And look across the water at the dirty, little shacks? Yes. All right. That's where we'll go. What are you trying to say? That I'm handing you New Orleans on a gold platter. You said if I had all the money I wanted. How much would that be? Is 55,000 enough? The bank money. How did you-? What's it matter? I've got it. Where is it? Is it safe? It's safe. When do we leave? Soon? Well, not too soon. It's gotta look right. A few weeks will do it. It's the first time anything like this ever happened. I'm awful sorry, Mr. Bodie. I checked all the other rooms, and yours is the only one. Wes? Wes? I saw you come across here like a charging buffalo. Something up? Everything's fine, Charlie. Seen Wes? He rode out of town about a half-hour ago. Hold up! Look straight ahead and lift that right hand. Now, where is it? Who are you? You're the man that killed Ed Grimes, and Ed was carrying the money. You're gonna tell me what you done with it. You're crazy! He didn't have it when I caught up with him. We both went in the river. Maybe it was lost there. Why you carrying them saddlebags? I always do. Look, mister, if I were you, I'd- Throw it over here and be quick about it. Left hand. Where you been, deputy? Supper. Just heard you were back. I rode out to see how old man Clements was making out. You're all dressed up, Wes. I'm seeing Claire later on. She likes this outfit. Oh, everything all right again? Aw, it wasn't much of anything anyway. I see nothing's happened while I was gone. Wes, if you don't need me, I'd like to go up to the hotel for a while. Well, sure. Be back in an hour, all right? Sooner than that. ? I'm goin' I'm goin' away ? ? For to stay A little while ? ? But- ? Who is it? I wanna talk to you. I'm in the tub. Well, get out of it and open the door. I'll get out when I'm finished. I said now. I'll be right out. Well... What? What's the idea? I hear you and Wes patched things up. Are you trying to make me think you're jealous? I might be. I don't mean a thing to you. Not that you try to make me think I did. Well, that's true, isn't it? So you decided to try Wes again? If I really thought it mattered to you, I'd- You'd what? But it doesn't. The one thing I know in this world is men. I know how you feel about me. I know you wouldn't... take chances just to have me. What kind of chances? Doesn't matter. I'm not used to being the one who does all the giving. I don't like it. I'm gonna marry Wes. Why? I told you. You told me Wes had nothing to offer you. I've changed my mind. What made you do that? There's only one reason you'd marry anybody. Money. A lot of it. What are you talking about? About $55,000. I came here hoping I was wrong. Your face just told me I'm not. I thought you liked Wes. I thought he was a friend of yours. He was more than that. Then how can you accuse him of- Because it's true, and there's nothing I can do about it. Cheyenne, listen to me. Wait, please! What are you gonna do? Why? We can have the money, you and I. When Wes tells me where- Well, that didn't take long. You've got trouble, Cheyenne? Look like you've lost your best friend. Something happened today, Wes. Maybe you can tell me what it means. Somebody tore my room apart looking for something. Looking for what? I was hoping you could tell me. Well, how would I know? Because he searched your room too. Why didn't you mention it? I don't tell you everything, deputy. It's not too late, Wes. The money could still be found. One of the men we killed could have dropped it before we caught up to him. Tomorrow, you could find it and bring it back. What are you trying to say? That I have the 55,000? I'd give a lot to be wrong. You don't have to give anything. You are wrong. No. But I'll forget about it if you'll bring it back. That badge is going to your head. I was afraid it might. I just talked to Claire. She's a liar, but not a very good one. That reminds me, I'm supposed to be up there. Wes, she's no good. She just offered to double-cross you and share the money with me. So that's it. You've got a lot to learn about women. Claire's letting her imagination run away with her and taking you along with it. I suppose she searched our rooms too. Oh, I think you hit the answer to that. Maybe one the men we killed was carrying the money and dropped it. That would explain why our rooms were searched. We'll check tomorrow. Good night, deputy. Don't go out that door. What was that? Don't people like Charlie and Gus Bowlin and all the rest of 'em mean anything to you? You said something about a door. Give the money back, Wes. Say you found it, say anything, but give it back. You didn't answer my question. I said, you don't go out that door unless I go with you to bring the money back. Remember what I told you? You weren't cut out to wear a star. I wish you'd kept that in mind. I kinda liked you. Don't open it, Wes. You trying to prove I'm wrong about you and that star on your chest? I'm trying to prove that I was right about you. Let her go. This is where you belong. It's not too late. I'm going out this door. I'd like to know if I have to kill you first. You'll have to try. Yeah. I guess I will. What happened? It's Wes. Who shot him? I'll get Doc Peters. I'm sorry, Wes. So am I. You got me good. Lot of your friends are here. What do you want me to tell them? Wes, you hurt bad? What happened? Doc's coming right away, Mr. Garth. You got me good, deputy. Kinda changes my plans. What happened? What's he mean, you got him? Cheyenne was trying to stop me. Tell them why, deputy. I was about to leave town with your- Your money. The money from the bank? What do you mean, Wes? What are you saying, Mr. Garth? It's in my room. In the saddlebag. Never did get you that new one. Should've. We found it. The money's here. I used to dread the day we'd lose him as sheriff. I guess I was wrong. We were all wrong. We still got a sheriff. Yes, and a good one too. That's right. Thanks, but it's not for me. You were right, Wes. I wasn't cut out to wear a star. But neither were you.
