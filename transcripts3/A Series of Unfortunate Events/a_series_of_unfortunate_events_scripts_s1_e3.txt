 [typewriter dings]
 [broken-hearted crocodile] Woe is me.
Woe is me.
 The cry you're hearing is that
of the broken-hearted crocodile.
 It is a rare species of reptile found in
swampy regions that are particularly sad.
 [broken-hearted crocodile] Woe is me.
Woe is me.
 My name is Lemony Snicket,
 and it is my sworn duty
to carefully research
 the dire plight of the
Baudelaire orphans.
 But there is no reason
for you to make yourself
 as miserable and
melancholy as I am.
 If I were you, I would look away
 before viewing any of the
horrible and horrifying events
 that comprise this ghastly new episode...
in the Baudelaires' unfortunate lives.
 It's a brand-new episode in
your lives, Baudelaires.
 In a few minutes you'll be meeting
your new guardian, Dr. Montgomery.
 He's your closest
living relative
 and apparently should've been
your guardian all along,
 according to your
deceased parents' will.
 I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to
listen to that oddly-dressed consultant
 who walked into my office with no
references and no identification,
 and who suggested that I place
you in Count Olaf's care.
 My siblings and I
wholeheartedly agree.
 My recently-rehired
secretary Jacquelyn
 is nervous that Count
Olaf is still at large,
 but I don't think Olaf will be
able to find you way out here.
 Oh, look, there's an easy-to-read
sign for Lousy Lane.
 [Lemony] The Baudelaire orphans
more than wholeheartedly agreed.
 And living with Count Olaf had
been more than a mistake.
 It had been a disaster. It
had been a catastrophe.
 And the worst of it
 was that the villainous Count
Olaf was still at large,
 a phrase which here means that the
authorities had not caught him
 and would not catch him
for a very long time.
 By the way, the police tell
me they feel very confident
 that Count Olaf will be
caught in no time at all.
 Ah, here's the turn.
 [Lemony] Lousy Lane is perhaps the
most unpleasant lane in the world.
 It runs past an orchard of trees
which once produced apples so sour,
 one only had to look
at them to feel ill.
 And it encircles a
horseradish factory,
 so the entire area smells
bitter and strong.
 [sniffs]
 [clears throat and coughs]
 [Mr. Poe coughs]
 Uh, what... what is that smell?
 [continues coughing] It's
ginger, I believe. We're here.
 How exactly is Dr.
Montgomery related to us?
 [Mr. Poe] Dr. Montgomery
is, let me see,
 your late father's
cousin's wife's brother.
 That probably explains
why you never met him.
 Come along, Violet.
 What do we call him? I mean,
he's not exactly our uncle.
 You can call him Dr. Montgomery,
 unless he asks you to call
him by his first name,
 in which case you'll
call him Montgomery.
 - His name is Montgomery Montgomery?
- Yes, yes.
 And I'm sure he's very sensitive about
that, so please don't ridicule him.
 - "Ridicule" means "tease."
- We know what ridicule means.
 [coughs] I can... I can
still smell that ginger.
 I hope Dr. Montgomery
is a decent person.
 [doorbell rings]
 Hello, hello, hello.
 - You must be the Baudelaires.
- Yes.
 Well, this is perfect timing because
I have just finished frosting
 this delicious
coconut cream cake.
 Take a fork, take a
fork, take a fork.
 - Nice to meet you, Dr. Montgomery.
- Please, call me Monty.
 I don't like fancy titles unless they
get me a discount at the movies.
 [gasps] Do you like
going to the movies?
 Very much. But our parents
didn't take us very often.
 Well, we are going to go a lot.
 To some very important
and very special films.
 What is your favorite movie?
 Um, Dawn Patrol,
the 1938 version.
 It was your father's
favorite, too.
 Well, let's not stand out here.
Come in!
 - Let's go.
- [Sunny fussing]
 Come along. Yes, we're going.
 [Monty] Now you must be
Violet, the inventor.
 And you are Klaus, the reader.
 Your mother was so proud of your
voracious intellectual appetites.
 And you must be Sunny.
 Would you like a piece of cake?
 My sister prefers
very hard food.
 Ah. Well, that is
unusual for a baby.
 But not so unusual
for many snakes.
 Perhaps Sunny would
prefer a raw carrot?
 Well, that leaves one
extra slice of cake.
 Hmm...
 I know. I'll eat it myself.
 [chuckles] I'm just
kidding, just kidding,
 Mr. Poe of Mulctuary Money Management,
you are welcome to a slice of cake.
 No, I should be getting back
to the bank soon. [coughs]
 Besides, coconut leaves a
funny feeling in my mouth.
 If you need anything, remember,
you can always reach me...
 They won't need anything
from you, Mr. Poe.
 They're finally in my care,
 and I will dedicate myself to their
safety, comfort and happiness
 as enthusiastically as I have dedicated
myself to this coconut cream cake.
 Our parents' fortune can't be
used until Violet comes of age.
 Klaus, don't be rude.
 Though, legally, he's
correct about the fortune.
 I don't give a fig about the
Baudelaire fortune, Mr. Poe,
 what with my salary from the
Herpetological Society.
 But, as a scientist... I do
admire your skepticism, Klaus.
 It's understandable after what
you children have been through.
 Ah, that unpleasantness with Count Olaf.
No need to scare the man.
 - [iguana clock screeching]
- [screams]
 Terribly sorry, Mr. Poe.
 My screeching iguana clock does
tend to startle some people.
 But then, so, of course,
does the screeching iguana.
 - I think I'll see myself out.
- Capital idea.
 Bye, Mr. Poe.
 Bye.
 Goodbye, children.
Remember you can reach me
 at Mulctuary Money Management
if you need me for anything.
 Just don't forget to call...
 I'm terribly sorry if I was
rude to him, children,
 but, frankly, that man
ruffles my scales.
 "Unpleasantness with
Count Olaf," he says,
 when Mr. Poe is the very reason you were
put with Count Olaf in the first place.
 Well, not to worry. You're
finally safe now, children,
 just as your parents wanted.
 Actually, Dr. Montgomery...
 - Monty.
- Monty...
 Uncle Monty, I hope,
once you get used to me.
 Monty, our parents
never mentioned you.
 Really?
 Really.
 Dr. Montgomery Montgomery?
 Renowned scientist?
 Herpetologist?
 Hmm.
 That is astonishing.
 Follow me. Now, your parents and
I practically grew up together.
 I can't believe your parents
never told you about me.
 I loved them dearly. Look,
here's a picture of us.
 - There's no one in that picture.
- [Monty] We're locked inside the piano.
 Ah, we were so young.
 Well, it seems that some proper
introductions need to be made.
 Do you know what
"herpetology" means?
 Well, "ology" always
means "the study of..."
 Snakes. Snakes, snakes, snakes.
That's what I study.
 I circle the globe in search of a
creature who can encircle a globe.
 Oh, don't worry
about your dishes.
 Just leave them anywhere.
Gustav will wash them up.
 Uh... Gustav!
 Oh, drat.
 What?
 I forgot all about Gustav.
 He was my assistant
for many years,
 then he left me a quite unexpected letter
of resignation just yesterday morning.
 Quite surprising, really.
Well, no matter what.
 Who needs an assistant when I have
three charming Baudelaire bambinis
 to help me with my research?
 Bambini?
 Bambini. It's Italian
for "children."
 [chuckles] Why, I'm so
giddy having you here
 that I might as well
be talking gibberish.
 Now, Baudelaires,
 I am about to show you one of the
most important scientific collections
 in the history of the world.
 Spies and rivals in the
world of herpetology
 would eat nine garter snakes
 to get a glimpse of the
wonders inside this room.
 This door has been installed with
top-of-the-line security system.
 [whirring]
 You can't get inside unless you
have 19 keys, three combinations,
 two fingerprints and
one optical scan.
 Or, as I share with my
most trusted associates...
 by turning this doorknob...
 right here.
 - [insects chirping]
- [frogs croaking]
 This is the Reptile Room.
 Feel free to explore.
 Here is the lizard wing...
 - and here... is a winged lizard.
- [lizard chittering]
 Now, see his yellow-striped belly, a
sign of camouflage and cowardice.
 Can it really fly?
 He can fly on cue.
 Fly!
 [Sunny cooing]
 [Sunny gasps]
 And here... we have the
dissonant tortoises,
 soothed only by the music of Alexander
Scriabin or early Sonic Youth.
 This, my dears, is my
most recent discovery.
 The crown jewel of the
Montgomery Reptile Collection.
 I discovered him on a recent journey
and I brought him under cover of night
 and a very large hat.
 Because next month, I
am going to present him
 to the Herpetological Society
as my new discovery.
 - I discovered him, so I got to name him.
- [hissing]
 [babbles]
 What is it called?
 The incredibly deadly viper.
 [Violet screams]
 [Lemony] One thing that
I have found is that
 when the story of the Baudelaires
becomes too upsetting for me,
 when it becomes
absolutely overwhelming,
 it is useful to stop for a
moment of contemplation,
 uh, with a cup of tea or some
other powerful beverage.
 However, I can sip my tea
knowing that Sunny Baudelaire
 absolutely survives this
particular incident.
 It is Dr. Montgomery, however, who
ends up dead, although not yet.
 Anyways, apologies for
the interruption.
 Cheers.
 - [Monty laughing]
- Do something!
 - Sunny!
- [Klaus] Get the snake!
 - The snake!
- [Violet] What are you doing?
 [Klaus] You let a deadly
snake bite our sister!
 - I told you we couldn't trust him.
- [Violet] You're laughing?
 - [Sunny giggling]
- [Monty continues laughing]
 I'm terribly sorry, children.
 I'm so sorry. Oh. [chuckles]
 But the incredibly deadly viper
is one of the friendliest
 and least dangerous animals
in the entire animal kingdom.
 Sunny will come to no harm
and neither will you.
 But it's called the
incredibly deadly viper.
 Yes. It's a misnomer. Do
you know what that means?
 "A very wrong name"?
 - Well, a very fitting definition.
- [cooing]
 Why would you give your own
discovery the wrong name?
 Because... I intend
to play a little joke
 on those stuffed shirts at
the Herpetological Society.
 Payback for years of ridicule.
 "Hello, hello,
Montgomery Montgomery.
 How do you do, how do you
do, Montgomery Montgomery?"
 Well, at our next meeting,
 I'm going to introduce the
incredibly deadly viper,
 and then pretend it's escaped.
 And you know who'll
be laughing then?
 Me.
 Are there any snakes in this
room that are dangerous?
 [Monty] Well, of course.
 You can't study snakes and not
find some that are dangerous.
 I have an entire cabinet
full of venom samples
 from some of the most
venomous snakes known to man.
 And woman.
 Which leads me to the
heart of the operation.
 Now, bambini,
 this is the most important
part of the Reptile Room:
 my scientific library.
 The deepest secrets of the snake
world can be found in these pages.
 And I hope that
you'll find them.
 So we're allowed to
read all these books?
 You are not only allowed, you are
implored to read these books.
 You know, I always wanted
to have a family of my own.
 But...
 time flies like a winged lizard.
 Now...
 I know... that a few
dangerous reptiles
 can make you skeptical
of the entire species.
 But, if you give
them a chance...
 and you get to know them well enough
to tell the dangerous from the good...
 I promise you...
 no harm will come to you
in the Reptile Room.
 There is a type of situation
which occurs all too often
 in the story of the Baudelaire
orphans, called dramatic irony.
 Simply put, dramatic irony is
when a person makes a remark,
 and someone who hears
it knows something,
 which makes the remark have a
different, usually unpleasant, meaning.
 Uh, for example, if I were to say, "I
can't wait to eat this almond cookie,"
 but there were people around that
knew the almond cookie was poisoned,
 that would be dramatic irony.
 For that reason, when we hear
Uncle Monty tell the children...
 [Monty] I promise you, no harm will
come to you in the Reptile Room.
 ...we should be on guard for the
unpleasant arrival of dramatic irony.
 [broken-hearted
crocodile] Woe is me.
 [soft growling]
 [broken-hearted
crocodile] Woe is me.
 Don't be sad. Uncle Monty
will be down soon.
 [chuckles] It can't
understand you.
 Dr. Montgomery said the broken-hearted
crocodile's mating call
 just happens to sound like
depressed human speech.
 I know. Just like talking to it.
 I wish he'd go back outside.
He's... annoying.
 - [broken-hearted crocodile] Woe is me.
- Woe is you?
 We're the ones whose
parents perished in a fire
 and now we're being passed
around like hot potatoes.
 Look, Klaus. It can't
understand you.
 I know that!
 Sorry.
 Klaus, I know how you feel.
 We're always gonna
miss our parents.
 But... Monty's been a
good guardian so far
 and it seems like our parents
really wanted us here.
 But that's just it.
 Our parents never mentioned Dr.
Montgomery.
 Why did we never visit him?
 I thought we knew all
our parents' friends.
 I thought we knew
everything about them.
 I'm sure they had a good reason
for not telling us about Monty.
 Maybe it was the same reason they
sent us to Briny Beach that day.
 Or maybe there was a
more sinister reason.
 Bambini? Baudelaire bambini!
There you are.
 How was your day?
 I polished the tortoise and
Sunny fed it some bananas
 and Klaus clipped
the iguana's nails.
 [Monty] Ah, thank you.
I'm so grateful.
 Perhaps, when I'm out,
 you can lure the androgynous
cobra out of my sock drawer.
 - Where are you going?
- Well, I'm gonna go into town
 and pick up a few things that
I like to keep in stock.
 Wasp repellent, canned
peaches, a fireproof canoe.
 And then, tonight, we'll go
and see our first movie.
 Won't that be exciting?
 - What movie are we seeing?
- Well, we won't know until we get there.
 I've never heard of a movie theater that
doesn't tell you what movie is playing.
 [chuckles] Klaus Baudelaire, I have
a feeling there are many things
 that you're going to see that
you've never heard of before.
 Life is a conundrum
of esoterica.
 Come along, Raymond Ditmars.
 - There we go. Come along.
- [grunts and hisses]
 Yes.
 Now, there we go.
 Ta-ta for now. Come
along, come along. Yes.
 Yes. That's right.
 What did he mean,
"conundrum of esoterica"?
 Well, a conundrum is a mystery.
 And esoterica are obscure
objects or documents.
 Look at this.
 This is the original blueprint for Dr.
Montgomery's landscaping.
 Those hedges outside
make up a labyrinth.
 And if you look at the labyrinth
from the top, it's...
 It looks like the tattoo
Count Olaf has on his ankle.
 [Klaus] It's a mark of villainy.
 [Violet] Monty cannot be in
cahoots with Count Olaf.
 [Violet sighs] He
seems too nice.
 [Klaus] Things aren't
always as they seem.
 Something strange
is going on here.
 Mother and Father told
us all sorts of stories
 that happened before
we were born.
 So why doesn't the name Montgomery
Montgomery ring a bell?
 [doorbell ringing]
 [heavy accent] Good morning.
 I am Stephano, Dr. Montgomery
Montgomery's new assistant.
 It's afternoon. And
you're Count Olaf.
 Perhaps one of you can take
my suitcases up to my room.
 The ride along that smelly
road was dull and unpleasant,
 and Stephano is very tired.
 You're Count Olaf,
 and if anyone ever deserved to
travel along Lousy Lane, it's you.
 We will not help you with your luggage
and we will not let you in this house.
 [in normal voice] Well, I see you
children haven't changed a bit.
 Violet, you're obviously
as stubborn as ever.
 Klaus, you're still wearing
those idiotic glasses
 from reading too many books.
 And I can see little Sunny here
still has nine toes instead of ten.
 What are you talking about?
 My sister has ten toes, like
the vast majority of people.
 Really? That's odd.
 I could have sworn that she lost
one of her toes in an accident.
 I seem to recall a
man named Stephano
 being so confused by
being called Count Olaf
 that he accidentally dropped his
knife on one of her little feet
 and severed one of her toes.
 You wouldn't dare.
 Let's not discuss what I
would or would not dare do.
 Instead, let's discuss your
poor, unfortunate parents.
 [chuckles]
 Your father and mother were
very brave in their days.
 But...
 [imitates explosion]
 Their days are
done, Baudelaires.
 That is not a photo
of our parents.
 Yes, it is. They're
inside the piano.
 How do you know that?
 I took the picture.
 And now, all that's left of
them is their enormous fortune,
 and that enormous
fortune is mine.
 - Never.
- Never is a very long time.
 And your ridiculous uncle will
be back in a few seconds.
 - [clock screeching]
- [gasps and screams]
 [Klaus] Go!
 - [grunts]
- [Klaus] Run!
 [grunts]
 Blast!
 Furnaces of hell!
 [grunts]
 - Baudelaires!
- [pounding on door]
 Baudelaires!
 [chuckles] I've brought
you a present.
 It's very sharp.
 - How did he find us?
- That's the wrong question.
 - What do we do?
- [Stephano] Open this door!
 We can smash a window and
make our way into town
 and catch a train
far away from here.
 - [pounding continues]
- And where would we go?
 Anywhere but here.
 If Count Olaf found us here, he
could find us wherever we went.
 Open this door!
 We can't just stay here and wait for
him to burst in and slaughter us.
 [Violet panting]
 He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't hurt us
till he gets his hands on our fortune.
 He must have some scheme. I just
don't know what it could be.
 We should never have
let him in the house.
 - We can't think about that now.
- Open the door!
 [Lemony] For years afterwards,
the Baudelaires wondered
 what they might have done differently the
day Count Olaf appeared at their door.
 Maybe, they thought, just maybe,
 - they could've saved Monty's life.
- [honking]
 - Monty's back.
- [Stephano] Hello!
 [Violet] He'll see right through
Stephano's disguise... won't he?
 [Stephano] My name is Stephano. I
have been sent from very far away.
 Well, that is an unusual and
long-winded explanation.
 Thank you.
 Uh... so let me understand this.
 You are my new assistant, sent to me
even though I didn't ask for one,
 by the Scientific Society Seeking
to Soothe Stress and Suffering.
 Yes.
 "SSSSSS" for short.
 - "SSSSSS."
- Mmm...
 No. It's "SSSSSS."
 "SSSSSS."
 No.
 Listen to... "SSSSSS."
 Ah, yeah, uh... "SSSSSS."
 - Yes.
- Ah...
 And your name is Stephano?
 What? Yes. Yes. Definitely.
 Ah! And these are your papers.
 Yes.
 [mumbling] "Stephano... SSSSSS"
 Hmm.
 Well, seems everything
is settled, then.
 - Really?
- Yes. Welcome.
 - Thank you.
- Come inside.
 Come in, come in.
 Welcome to my home... um...
 uh...
 Uh...
 - Stephano!
- Stephano!
 Stephano. Yes.
 Well, there's a spare
room upstairs.
 It's small, but like I said, I have
three young children living with me,
 - so living quarters are quite tight.
- Not for long.
 I mean, I don't mind.
 Ah.
 Well, why don't you go upstairs
and get yourself settled?
 And I will go and find the
children, who you say have...
 hidden themselves
in the Reptile Room
 because you chased them up and
down the staircase with a knife.
 A simple misunderstanding.
 Yes. Well, I'm sure they'll
be glad to hear that.
 Are those suitcases
alligator skin?
 I really love reptiles.
 Hmm. Baudelaires?
 - Is that you, Dr. Montgomery?
- [Monty] Yes!
 Uh, let me just unlock all these
important security measures
 and I'll join you in
the Reptile Room!
 [imitating gears turning]
 [imitating machinery whirring]
 [imitating door unlocking]
 Retinal scan one.
 [imitates electrical buzzing]
 Retinal scan two.
 [imitating beeping]
 [loudly] I am so
sorry, Baudelaires,
 that you were frightened by
that man who arrived earlier.
 Um, it makes sense
that you were alarmed,
 being that he chased you up and
down the stairs with a knife.
 But there's nothing to fear.
 He is my new
assistant, Stephano.
 I have seen his papers and
everything is in order.
 So, you see, there's nothing
to be worried about.
 Oh, yes... I see now.
 How silly we were to be afraid.
 Precisely, Baudelaires!
 Uh, Stephano has explained to me
 that he has a very
strict fitness regimen,
 where he has to run up and down
the stairs brandishing a knife
 at least three times a day.
 So, that makes perfect sense.
 I might join him on
that exercise regimen.
 [whispers] Very good, very good.
 [speaking loudly] So, now
that that is cleared up,
 would you mind helping me bring
things in from my truck?
 I got all my shopping done and I
even brought takeout for dinner.
 There should even be
enough for Stephano.
 Now, we don't have much
time before the movie,
 so help me take down this canoe.
 [whispering] Here we go.
 [grunts] I am so
sorry, Baudelaires.
 I had no idea that our enemies
would catch up to us so quickly.
 It's clear now that I can't
turn my back for a second.
 - So you recognized him?
- Of course I recognized him.
 I'm not some half-witted banker
or some member of a High Court,
 who's so starstruck that I can't
see what's right in front of me.
 He can wear as many lab
coats as he wants,
 and present me with as many
ridiculous papers as he wants.
 He's no more a lab assistant than I'm
a three-mouth Brazilian waxed turtle.
 So what are we gonna do?
 - Call the authorities?
- What does H-A spell?
 You think when I was climbing Mount Felix
searching for the goat-eating cobra,
 that I called the authorities?
No.
 If we call the police or Mr. Poe
or the official fire department,
 that so-called lab assistant
will have us in his clutches
 before they can
darken my doorstep.
 And we all know Stephano
does not work alone.
 We must keep an eye on Stephano.
 He will join us for dinner
 and then we'll invite him
to the movies tonight.
 A man that dastardly must
be watched like a hawk.
 That's all we're gonna do?
Keep an eye on him?
 For now, Baudelaires,
 we'll be watchful and wary,
 which is a word that around
here means "very careful."
 - We know what wary means.
- Good.
 Because...
 we can't afford to turn our
backs, not even for a second.
 Besides... [grunts]
 - Dr. Montgomery.
- Monty!
 So sorry.
 I seem to have been very careless
with the heavy glass reading lamp
 that was in my bedroom
 that fell out right when
you were walking under it.
 Uh, yeah. Totally
understandable.
 It... it happens all the time.
[chuckles]
 - Sorry about that.
- [Monty grunts]
 [chuckling] No harm done.
 [softly] I know the
layout of that room
 as well as I know the bone structure
of the osteoporosis lizard,
 and there is no way that that
lamp was near that window.
 Of course not.
 He wasn't being careless.
He was being murderous.
 [Klaus] Dr. Montgomery, I really think
we ought to contact the authorities.
 Trust me, Baudelaires...
 I may be a world-renowned
herpetologist,
 but I also minored
in criminology.
 I know what I'm doing.
 Now let's eat quickly, everyone. We
don't want to be late for the movies.
 I don't think I'll
be joining tonight.
 I thought I'd stay in and
read up on poisonous venoms.
 Well, Stephano, you must join us.
We have to celebrate your arrival.
 In all honesty, I prefer long-form
television to the movies.
 It's so much more convenient
to consume entertainment
 from the comfort
of your own home.
 [Monty] Hmm. Well,
I insist you come.
 I insist upon staying here.
 Well, I insisted first.
 Well, I insisted... louder!
 Well... [chuckles]
 With all due respect, I
feel a little uncomfortable
 leaving my reptiles alone
with a relative stranger.
 [sighs] Fine.
 But I would like to make a brief
phone call before we leave.
 Of course.
 The phone is in the parlor.
 - Could you please pass the pot stickers?
- Yeah.
 [muffled] They're all gone.
 [in normal voice]
Yes, a movie theater.
 Where they show movies.
 Yes, of course it's
more convenient
 to watch from the comfort
of your own home,
 but I didn't ask
for your opinion.
 [door closes]
 [Stephano] Shotgun.
 Thank you.
 - Hurry up.
- [Monty] In you go, Klaus.
 Ticktock.
 Don't want to miss the previews.
 - [Sunny cooing]
- [Monty] There you go.
 And all of the
excessive commercials.
 [Monty] Yeah, and then just keep...
Get in. All right.
 We don't know what you're up
to, but we will find out.
 If anything happens
to my sisters or me,
 you'll never get your hands
on the Baudelaire fortune.
 [normal voice] If I wanted
to harm you, orphan,
 your blood would be streaming out
of this car like a waterfall.
 No, I am not going to harm a
hair on any Baudelaire head.
 At least, not on purpose.
 But accidents happen all
the time, don't they?
 [accented voice] And that
is when I said to him,
 "The frog is the greatest
reptile known to man."
 - Frogs are amphibians.
- What?
 Stephano, where did you
study herpetology?
 I don't know anything
about mouth sores.
 - [upbeat music on radio]
- Oh! I love this song!
 I just thought it might be nice
to get out and see a movie.
 I need more exciting
things in my life.
 And I think it's because
my life is boring.
 Yes. Uh, well, enjoy
the show, ma'am.
 - [ticket seller] Dr. Montgomery!
- Hello, old chap!
 Two adults, three minors.
 I'm giving you the
Verified Film Discount.
 [Monty] Ah, lovely.
 I decided to treat
myself to some popcorn
 because there is nothing exciting
happening in my life at all.
 Hey... [stuttering] Some popcorn
actually sound delicious.
 I get popcorn for me, for all of us.
My treat.
 - Really?
- Yes, you go. Go take a seat.
 Come on, children.
 [Stephano] Go, go. Go, go.
 Seventh row, right of center,
that is the best place.
 That's what our
mother always said.
 Who do you think
taught it to me?
 You know, kids, I am so happy
to be seeing a movie with you.
 Your parents would be so very proud.
I know they would.
 [Klaus] For seeing a movie?
 There's more to a movie
than just a movie.
 Just like a book can contain crucial
secrets about the world of snakes,
 or it can be used to prop
open a refrigerator door
 when you're airing it out.
 What my sister means is, we're not
sure we're really following you.
 Ah, there's so much to learn.
 Unfortunately, some of that learning is
going to have to be delayed tonight,
 because of you-know-who.
 [whispering] Promise me this...
 If I leave during the showing, you
will not act as if anything is amiss,
 but you'll keep your eyes
on that fraud Stephano.
 [Sunny cries]
 - I got the popcorn.
- Ah!
 This one is for me, and this
one is for the rest of you.
 Oh...
 Your generosity is
noted, Stephano.
 My name is not, uh...
Nothing but Stephano.
 Shh.
 [Sunny cooing]
 [dramatic instrumental
music plays]
 Ah, Gustav.
 [whispers] Not now.
 Subtitles? This movie
is boring already.
 - [Rolf] Come, Gerta.
- [Gerta gasps]
 Two.
 [Rolf] Today, we honor
the founding...
 - Six.
- ...of our sleepy alpine village
 with the traditional
building of a snowman
 - Four.
- ...in the village square.
 Traditions are important, Rolf.
 If the movie's in English, why
are there English subtitles?
 All the best movies
have subtitles.
 But that still
doesn't explain...
 - Shh.
- [old woman] Shh!
 I'm watching the movie!
 No! Where is your conscience?
 Klaus, haven't we seen
that actress before?
 I don't think we've seen
anything like this before.
 Sing about it!
 ? They'll eat your feet
They'll eat your feet?
 ? They'll munch on your head
They'll munch on your head?
 ? You're a tasty treat
You're a tasty treat?
 ? For the walking dead?
 The sturdy oak barrier!
They've broken through it!
 Gerta... don't let them
take the children!
 [beeping]
 - [Rolf and Gerta grunting]
- [horse neighing]
 [Rolf grunts]
 - [Gerta panting]
- [Rolf grunts]
 [horse whinnies]
 - [Rolf] Onward. To the safe house.
- Hmm.
 - Don't shed tears, sweet Gerta.
- [beeping]
 I promise this isn't goodbye.
 No one's preparing to die, Rolf.
 Put on this warm scarf...
 - [Rolf groaning]
- [beeping]
 [sneezes] Oh, I need
to get more popcorn.
 [Rolf wheezing and groaning]
 And your poor mother's tutu.
 - Should I go this way?
- No, no, no.
 - Just go that way.
- You're blocking the screen!
 - Is it better to go this way?
- Sit down!
 - No. Go that way.
- I can go this way.
 - You're blocking the screen!
- I'm all right...
 - I'll go here.
- Go that way.
 - That way? Aye, no.
- Yes.
 I feel like your elbow tell me
 - and your hand, your finger...
- That way.
 [old woman] You're
blocking the screen!
 - I'm sorry.
- [old woman] I can't see!
 I hope you didn't miss anything.
 [Gerta] You'll always
be in my heart...
 and in this snow bank.
 Per favore.
 - Butter?
- Salt?
 [normal voice] I'd thank you...
 - [both] Ooh.
- ...for coming on such short notice,
 but I'm not in the habit of
coddling my henchpeople.
 Due to one overprotective
herpetologist's hysteria
 over the safety of his appalling
collection of creatures,
 Operation Capture Monty
has been relocated
 from Monty's home to this
godforsaken nickelodeon.
 And just in time.
 I think you-know-who is trying
to send a you-know-what.
 Hello?
 Am I... [sighs]
 A message.
 They're trying to send a...
 Oh, forget it. Operation
Capture Monty is a go.
 Is there anything
else I should know?
 You look handsome in that beard.
 [accented voice] Hmm.
I already knew that.
 [zombie] I am zombie.
 [Rolf and Gerta singing]
 What did I miss? Oh, boy,
they're still singing.
 I am going to need
to excuse myself.
 - Shh.
- Nature calls.
 Stephano, would you be so kind as
to keep an eye on the children?
 Wait, Dr. Montgomery said
to keep an eye on us.
 We're too young to be
left in a theater alone.
 [old woman] Down in front.
 Get out of the way!
 - Pictures today. So violent.
- Mmm-hmm.
 Mother always said we'd
catch a man at the movies.
 Uh-huh.
 Surely nothing can spoil this
happy and festive occasion.
 There are hundreds of zombies
coming down from those snow banks!
 - ? They'll munch on your head?
- [old woman] What? What's going on?
 [Gerta screaming]
 And your poor mother's tutu.
 [old woman] We've
already seen this part!
 [Gerta] And in this snow bank...
 Well, that is where
I shall bury you.
 This would be much
easier with a shovel.
 How can we overcome
our differences...
 Quick splicing, old friend.
 Things must be worse
than we thought.
 I need four tickets on
the SS Prospero to Peru.
 Meet me at the ticket booth.
I sell all kinds of tickets.
 - [zombie groans]
- [Gerta yelps]
 - Well, wish me luck, old friend.
- Good luck, Dr. Montgomery.
 And a one and a two and
a chicka-booma-chick.
 [Monty grunting]
 [Lemony] The Baudelaires did not wanna
turn their backs on Count Olaf,
 so they did not see what happened
in the back of that dark theater.
 But, of course, there
was much more going on
 that the Baudelaire orphans
were not aware of.
 [sighs] Ah, well, that
was a narrow escape
 full of incredible twists and
astonishing acrobatics. Can you walk?
 Better than I can waltz.
 If we're lucky, we'll be with
the children by bedtime.
 Any idea where this
tunnel lets out?
 I'd say judging by the barometric
pressure and watery winds,
 somewhere south of Winnipeg.
 [creaking]
 Peru.
 Like I said. South of Winnipeg.
 [fanfare playing]
 Terrible ending.
 The villagers should have been
eaten, like in Citizen Kane.
 Monty never came back.
 - Monty!
- Monty?
 What's this? Your
guardian has disappeared?
 Dear me, dear me.
 Ah, this is just terrible.
 Three helpless children
all alone in the world.
 Whatever shall we do next?
 Drive home, of course.
 - Monty!
- You're here.
 [Monty] Hello, children.
 It's been a long night and we
have a very busy day tomorrow.
 - Did you enjoy the movie?
- It was unusual.
 [Monty] Uh, it will require
some further explanation.
 Wait in the car, Baudelaires.
 I have some unfinished
business with Stephano.
 - Will you be okay?
- Of course.
 I am your guardian.
 It is my job...
 and my delight, might I
add, to keep you safe.
 Run along.
 Arrive... chechem.
 Do you think you can
just waltz into my life,
 and the life of my children,
and perpetuate this treachery?
 You're a wretched person
 and a bad actor, Stephano,
 or whatever your real name is.
 [normal voice] You don't
know my real name?
 I don't need to know
your real name.
 Because you...
 are a spy from the
Herpetological Society.
 What?
 Can you hear what
they're saying?
 [Klaus] I hope he's telling Count Olaf
that his plot is foiled and he's done for.
 You're done for, Stephano.
 Well, what can I say,
Montgomery Montgomery?
 You have found out my secret identity.
There's no doubt about it.
 I've been outsmarted.
 Yes. You have.
 Now be gone. You and your...
pale-face twins.
 I said be gone!
 Hang your head in
shame, herpeta-loser.
 [chuckles]
 [white-faced women struggling]
 [sighs]
 - He's tougher than he looks.
- Even tougher than two old ladies.
 Really?
 Well, Baudelaires, that terrible
man will never bother us again.
 - You mean...
- That's right.
 I confronted him and threw him
out of our lives forever.
 [chuckles] The authorities
are on their way.
 And we're just leaving him there?
In the parking lot?
 Under the watchful eye of a
very capable ticket seller.
 Besides, if he does slip away...
 Again.
 Well, it's none of our concern. We
will be far, far away from here.
 Baudelaires, we are not going to spend
the season in a research laboratory.
 We are off to Peru.
 - [both] Peru?
- It's a wonderful country,
 full of natural and
slithering beauty.
 And what's more
important, answers.
 You must have oodles of
questions after that movie.
 If my parents hadn't taught me
about this when I was your age,
 my head would be dizzy
with confusion.
 Well, once we disembark in Chimbote, you
will have all the answers you need.
 What do you say, Baudelaires?
Are you in?
 We're in, Monty.
 Well, it's a good thing I stocked
up on peaches and canoes.
 You never know when you might need to
leave the country in a moment's notice.
 Life is a conundrum
of esoterica.
 [Monty] Well said, Klaus Baudelaire.
Well said.
 Then we travel inward
to Ollantaytambo
 in search of some geckos
who have an extra leg.
 First one to find one
gets to name it.
 - Sounds wonderful.
- Doesn't it?
 Listen, children. I know that the loss
of your parents was a great tragedy.
 But you can still have the
life they wanted for you.
 But now, it is time for bed.
Yes.
 We have a squidillion things to
do tomorrow and a boat to catch.
 Oh, Sunny, it seems that you
finished all of your marshmallows.
 What my sister means...
 I know what your
sister means, Violet.
 It seems we finally found a soft
food that you like after all.
 [all laughing]
 - [Monty] More on that tomorrow.
- [Sunny cooing]
 - Good night, bambini.
- Good night.
 Good night, Uncle Monty.
 Sweet dreams. And tomorrow...
Peru.
 [Sunny cooing]
 [clock screeching]
 I'm sorry to say this
was the last time
 the screeching iguana clock would strike
before the arrival of dramatic irony.
 But as Dr. Montgomery
had promised,
 no harm would come to the Baudelaire
orphans in the Reptile Room.
 But I regret to say that great
harm would come to Uncle Monty.
