 - THE MEGA YACHT IS THE ULTIMATE FLOATING PLAYGROUND FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS. [women cheering] CHARTERING A YACHT OF THIS SIZE FOR JUST A WEEKEND COSTS MORE THAN YOUR HOUSE. - IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. ALMOST LIKE OUT OF A FAIRY TALE. - IT'S A NEW CHARTER SEASON WITH A BRAND-NEW CREW. - YOU MUST BE BEN, THE CHEF? - YEAH, HEY, HOW ARE YOU? - ALEKS. NICE TO MEET YOU. - NICE TO MEET YOU. - YOU THROW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER IN TOGETHER, AND YOU JUST SAY, "GO."

 - COMING THROUGH, COMING THROUGH. WHERE'S MY BUTTER? [glass breaking] [bleep]. - WE PARTY HARD, WE PLAY HARD, WE WORK HARD. - GO TO WORK! - OUR JOB IS GREAT. BASICALLY WE HANG OUT ALL DAY IN PARADISE, PLAY WITH EXPENSIVE TOYS, AND SOMEBODY ELSE PICKS UP THE TAB. - I'M NOT SITTING IN AN OFFICE FROM 9:00 TO 5:00 IN A CUBICLE. YEAH, MY HOURS ARE SOMETIMES CRAZY, BUT I'M IN PARADISE. - TO SAILING THE SEVEN SEAS! - [laughs] WHEN THIS OPPORTUNITY CAME UP TO LEAVE MY OFFICE JOB AND GO AND WORK ON A YACHT, I HAD TO TAKE IT. - WE LIVE TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER,

 AND WHEN YOU'RE IN SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS, IT GETS STRESSFUL, AND IT GETS FRUSTRATING. - IF YOU WANT TO GO TO WAR WITH ME ABOUT THIS THING, WE CAN DO THAT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW, OR YOU CAN JUST DO YOUR JOB. - I GET [bleep] DONE. THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD SAY ON MY BUSINESS CARD. "GETS [bleep] DONE." JUST BRING ME A PLATE. THERE'S STILL SPOTS ON THE MIRROR. AND THE FLOORS HAVEN'T BEEN VACUUMED. - PICK UP A RAG YOURSELF, ADRIENNE. - [screams] - THERE IS DEFINITE PRESSURE. IF MY YACHTING CAREER OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS WAS ANYTHING LIKE THIS, I WOULDN'T BE DOING IT ANYMORE. I AM MY OWN BOSS. - NOBODY'S LEAVING THE BOAT TONIGHT. - YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. I'M ACTUALLY A HIGHER RANK THAN YOU, SO-- - I AM NOT A "YACHTIE," FIRST OFF. I TAKE IT VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE THIS IS MY LIVELIHOOD, THIS IS MY CAREER. - WE GOT A [bleep]DAMN JOB TO DO. LET'S [bleep] GET IT DONE! I DON'T GIVE A [bleep] IF I HAVE $200 EXTRA! I'VE GOT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE AND PROBABLY THE LOWEST AMOUNT OF CREDENTIALS. BUT GIVE ME A CHALLENGE AND I'LL MEET IT. - DON'T DRINK TOO MUCH! THIS IS FRICKIN' WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. HAVING A GOOD TIME, A REAL GOOD TIME. AH! [grunts] - LIVING ON A YACHT IS ALWAYS GONNA BE DIFFICULT. - I'M TIRED OF WORKING MYSELF LITERALLY TO THE BONE. - HOPEFULLY, WE DON'T SCREW IT UP. HOLY [bleep]. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - THAT DOG IS SO CUTE. - THAT'S MY BOY, ED. HE HAS A REALLY MICROSCOPIC PENIS, THOUGH. - [laughs] - HIS PENIS IS LIKE THAT. - OH, ONLY A HALF AN INCH. DO YOU THINK IT AFFECTS HIS PERSONALITY? LIKE, MAKES HIM MORE SENSITIVE? [laughter] - HE'S THE MOST MELLOW, SENSITIVE... - YEAH. - KIND, LOVING SOUL. - THAT'S 'CAUSE HE HAS A LITTLE PENIS. YOU TAKE A POSITION ON A BOAT, AND YOU'RE OUT TO SEA WITH THESE PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE [bleep] BAT[bleep] CRAZY, SO WHEN YOU MEET SOME OF YOUR CREW AND YOU INSTANTLY CONNECT WITH SOMEONE, IT'S SUCH A RELIEF. THAT'S HOW YOU CAN DISTINGUISH THE NICE GUYS FROM THE MEAN ONES. - WHAT, YOU WANT TO DATE NICE GUYS WITH LITTLE PENISES, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? - [laughs] - I HAVE A B.S. IN INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING, AND THEN I GET TO THIS STUPID 9:00 TO 5:00 JOB, AND THEY'RE PAYING ME $32,000 A YEAR TO, LIKE, WASTE AWAY IN AN OFFICE CHAIR. AND THEY FEED YOU, LIKE, CAKE AND COOKIES. AND IT MAKES YOU FAT, AND YOU DON'T GET TO EXERCISE. AND I REALLY FELT LIKE IT WAS JUST KILLING ME. THERE'S GOT TO BE A HAPPY MEDIUM IN THERE SOMEWHERE. - THERE IS, ACTUALLY. I'VE MET ONE. - A BIG-PENISED NICE GUY? - YEP. - THOSE EXIST? - MM-HMM. - DID HE KNOW HOW TO USE IT? - [laughs] - OH, WELL, THAT'S THE ISSUE THEN. - [laughs] - HELLO. - HI. EDDIE. NICE TO MEET YOU. - HI, EDDIE, NICE TO MEET YOU. ADRIENNE. GOOD TO MEET YOU. - DAVE. - DAVID, NICE TO MEET YOU. - CJ. NICE TO MEET YOU. - CJ, NICE TO MEET YOU. COME ON BOARD. - ALL RIGHTY. I'M FROM COASTAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY, AND I LIKE TO FIX STUFF. I REALIZED A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT I DIDN'T LIKE SITTING IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER, I DIDN'T LIKE WORKING 18 HOURS A DAY RUNNING A BUSINESS. I GREW UP SURFING AND SKIMBOARDING AND BOOGIEBOARDING, AND, LIKE, THAT'S JUST WHAT I LIKE DOING, SO THIS IS PERFECT. IF I CAN TAKE THAT AND HAVE SOMEONE ELSE PAY FOR IT? PERFECT. - YOU WANT TOP BUNK OR BOTTOM? [laughs] - WHATEVER YOU WANT. - I'LL DO THE BOTTOM. - THERE'S 12 BEDROOMS ON THIS DAMN BOAT... AND I LIVE IN A CLOSET. I'M A GAY MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT ALL MY LOTIONS AND POTIONS. EDDIE AND I ARE BECOMING CLOSE VERY QUICKLY. I'M GONNA BE UP ON TOP. - FIRST TIME GENERAL ALARM GOES OFF, I'M GONNA SMACK MY HEAD. - IT WAS PRETTY EASY. - HAVE YOU BUNKED WITH A GUY BEFORE EVER? - NOT IN, LIKE, THIS CLOSE OF QUARTERS. - IT'S NICE ABOUT THESE BIGGER BOATS 'CAUSE USUALLY YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, TWO PEOPLE AND YOUR OWN BATHROOM VERSUS, LIKE, SOME OF THE SMALLER 115, 120s, YOU'VE GOT ONE SHOWER, ONE TOILET, AND EVERYONE'S FIGHTING OVER, YOU KNOW, GETTING IN THERE. I THINK THAT I'M A GOOD GUY ROOMMATE 'CAUSE I'M NOT MESSY, I'M PRETTY METROSEXUAL, I TEND TO BE CLEAN. - HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE BOTTOM BUNK? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT? - YEAH, NO. EITHER ONE WORKS FOR ME. - I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT STUCK IN THE ONLY CO-ED BUNK, BUT I'M NOT COMPLAINING. HE'S VERY GOOD-LOOKING. - DO YOU WANT THE TOP ONE, OR DOES THAT HAPPEN TO BE WHERE YOU'RE HANGING OUT RIGHT NOW? - UM, NO, I KINDA LIKE IT 'CAUSE I GET, LIKE, SOME EXTRA ROOM... - OH, NICE. - AND SOME EXTRA STORAGE. - HOW CAN I TURN A BLIND EYE TO A SMOKING HOT CHICK GETTING HALF-NAKED IN MY CABIN EVERY NIGHT? I LIKE HAVING CASUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH WOMEN. I'M ALSO ATTENTION-NEEDY AND HORNY, SO IT'S GONNA [bleep]-- SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN. - OKAY, SO WHAT I WENT AHEAD AND DID WAS PUT TOGETHER BINDERS, AND IF I CAN GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU THESE. I GOT YOU RULERS AS WELL. THIS IS JUST FOR THE FIRST HANDFUL OF TIMES THAT WE SET TABLES TOGETHER 'CAUSE I JUST WENT THROUGH A SILVER SERVICE COURSE TO BRUSH UP. THIS IS MY CAREER. THIS IS MY LIFE. KNOWING THAT THE GUESTS ARE HAPPY, SATISFIED, COMFORTABLE HELPS ME SLEEP AT NIGHT. AS REFERENCES, I'LL HAVE THIS MANUAL TO GO THROUGH IF YOU NEED IT, IF YOU NEED TO LOOK AT PICTURES OF TABLE SETTINGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I HAVE BEEN A STEW FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I AM A CHIEF STEW, AND I'M TERRIFIED. BUT NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW THAT. - I'VE BEEN IN--WORKING ON MOTOR YACHTS FOR TWO YEARS. FROM, LIKE, CANADA TO THE BAHAMAS, MEXICO, PANAMA--I'VE GONE THROUGH THE PANAMA CANAL-- AND I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE CARIBBEAN. I WAS DEFINITELY BORED LIVING IN RHODE ISLAND. IT JUST WAS THE SAME OLD THING, DAY AFTER DAY. SAME OLD BARS, SAME OLD PEOPLE, SAME FACES. YOU KNOW, I'M YOUNG, AND I'M SINGLE, SO I CAN JUST GET ON A BOAT AND GO. SO I'VE WORKED ON, LIKE, 75-FOOT BOATS, AND MY LARGEST WAS 150. - WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN-- - UM, NOT QUITE AS EXTENSIVE. MY FAMILY HAS A CATAMARAN, SO WE DO, LIKE, DAY CHARTERS. - HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING WITH GUESTS ON A CHARTER? - NOT THIS FORMAL. THEY'VE BEEN, UM, FRIENDS... - ON A CATAMARAN? - OR FRIENDS OF FRIENDS, YEAH. - HER PARENTS OWN A YACHT, AND THERE'S KIND OF A STIGMA THAT GOES WITH THAT IN THE YACHTING INDUSTRY. THERE'S A LOT OF, UM... LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU JUST DON'T... KNOW THAT YOU DON'T KNOW YET. - ADRIENNE JUST HAS THIS REALLY STERN GLARE, LIKE SHE'S GETTING INTO YOUR SOUL WHEN SHE LOOKS AT YOU AND, LIKE, EYE-RAPES YOU. - SO IT'S JUST ABOUT FIGURING IT OUT AND ME HAVING PATIENCE... - YEAH. - WHICH I'M NOT ALWAYS VERY GOOD AT. - [laughs nervously] - HEY, LEE? - YEAH? - I HAVE ALEKS HERE FOR YOU. - ALEKS. - LEE. - LEE ROSBACH. - CAPTAIN. NICE TO MEET YOU. - MY PLEASURE. HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD, HOW YOU DOING? - I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS TO IT. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND GO DOWNSTAIRS. - OKAY. - IT WAS GOOD MEETING YOU. - YELL IF YOU NEED ME. - ALL RIGHT, THANKS. SO WELCOME ABOARD. - THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. - I JUST WANT TO GO OVER SOME THINGS WITH YOUR RESUME. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN A CAPTAIN BEFORE, AND I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO SET THAT ASIDE BECAUSE, AS YOU'RE AWARE, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE CAPTAIN ON A BOAT. ON THIS ONE, I'M IT. - UNDERSTOOD. - THE DECK CREW IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. THE EXTERIOR OF THE BOAT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. I EXPECT YOU TO BE A WORKING FIRST OFFICER. - I WAS 19 WHEN I GOT MY FIRST CAPTAIN'S LICENSE. I GET [bleep] FOR MY AGE ALL THE TIME. YOU GET AN OLD CAPTAIN, YOU KNOW, 75 YEARS OLD, "WHO THE [bleep] ARE YOU?" YOU KNOW? MY GENERAL GOAL IS TO TAKE COMMAND OF A BOAT THIS SIZE, IF NOT GREATER, BUT I UNDERSTAND, I'M SO YOUNG, I HAVE TO WORK MY WAY UP THE LADDER, AND I'M WILLING TO DO SO. I'VE BEEN ON IT 24/7. I'VE BEEN A WORKAHOLIC ALL MY LIFE. I'M VERY MOTIVATED, AND I WANT TO SUCCEED. I WANT TO RETIRE YOUNG. - AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT SHORT TURNAROUNDS ON THIS THING. OUR SERVICE HAS TO BE ABOVE EXPECTATIONS, AND EVERYBODY BUSTS THEIR ASS. - AYE, AYE. [laughter] - AYE, AYE. - ADRIENNE, ADRIENNE, LEE. - GO FOR ADRIENNE. - YEAH, YOU WANNA GO AHEAD AND GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER, ASSEMBLED ON THE AFT DECK. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A, UH, A LITTLE MEETING. - COPY. - ALL RISE. - SIT DOWN. MY NAME'S LEE ROSBACH. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN. THAT'S FRED. THIS IS NASH, YOUR CHIEF ENGINEER. ALEKS IS TAKING OVER FOR FRED. THERE'S GONNA BE A TRANSITION PERIOD. WE'VE GOT A SPECIFIC CHAIN OF COMMAND THAT WE FOLLOW. I'M THE CAPTAIN. FRED, ALEKS, AND THE DEPARTMENT HEADS, YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE. AND ONE THING I WON'T TOLERATE IS YOU GUYS GOING OVER YOUR DEPARTMENT'S HEAD. YOU GOT A CHAIN OF COMMAND, FOLLOW IT. - LEE HAS BEEN ON A BOAT LONGER THAN ALL OF US. BEFORE A LOT OF US EVEN-- BEEN EVEN BORN. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. HE HAS A SET WAY, HE'S THE CAPTAIN, THIS IS HIS BOAT, WE GOTTA FOLLOW IT. - I'VE GOT SOME RULES ABOUT CHARTER GUESTS. YOU DON'T SOCIALIZE WITH THEM. THEY'RE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. YOU NEED TO REMEMBER YOUR STATION ON THE BOAT. YOUR STATION IS TO SERVE, OVER AND ABOVE. IF SOMEBODY ASKS YOU TO GO PICK UP THEIR GLASSES, CLEAN 'EM OFF BEFORE YOU HAND IT TO THEM. LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT. IT'LL PROBABLY BE REFLECTED DIRECTLY IN YOUR TIP, IN YOUR GRATUITY, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WORK FOR. - CHARTERS CAN RUN FROM $100,000 TO $200,000 TO $300,000 A WEEK. YOU KNOW, WE GET TIPS. AVERAGE, YOU KNOW, TIP ON A YACHTING CHARTER IS ABOUT 10% TO 15%. - IF YOU DO A GOOD JOB AND WORK YOUR ASS OFF, YOU'VE MADE MORE THAN HALF YOUR MONTH'S SALARY IN A WEEK. - HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS DRINK? [chuckling] ALL RIGHT. WHEN WE'RE ON CHARTER, YOU DON'T DRINK. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. IF YOU'RE OFF CHARTER, YOU WANT TO PARTY, I DON'T CARE, BUT IF IT'S A DAY YOU'VE GOTTA WORK, YOU'D BETTER BE BRIGHT-EYED AND BUSHY-TAILED. I WILL ROUST YOU OUT OF YOUR BUNK. - HE'S KIND OF LIKE THE WIZARD OF OZ, AND, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO PISS THAT GUY OFF. - OUR FIRST CHARTER IS TOMORROW. WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR READY FOR THEM. THE LAUNDRY'S GOTTA BE DONE AND IRONED, MORE PROVISIONS BROUGHT ON BOARD, MORE FUEL. EVERYTHING'S GOTTA BE PERFECT. SO SOME OF YOU GUYS ARE REALLY NEW, I UNDERSTAND, AND THE LEARNING CURVE IS GONNA BE INTENSE. - WE'RE DEFINITELY IN FOR A WILD RIDE. - I THINK WE'LL CALL THE MEETING TO A CLOSE. YOU GUYS START GETTING AFTER IT, OKAY? - ALL RIGHT. - THAT'S A WRAP! - ALL RIGHT. - THANK YOU. - ALL RIGHT. - LET'S GO TO WORK. - SO YOU DO KNOW HOW TO-- - YES, YES. I KNOW HOW TO POUR CHAMPAGNE. - AND YOU TWIST THE BOTTLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T DRIP. - YES, ADRIENNE. JUST [bleep] CHILL. - ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THE PROVISIONS ARE HERE. LET'S GET THEM LOADED IN THE GALLEY FOR BEN. LET'S GET AN ASSEMBLY LINE GOING. - WHOA. [laughs] - NICE MEAT YOU GOT THERE. - WE'RE GONNA HAVE ALL OF THE RED MEAT HERE... - OKAY. - AND THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA ACTUALLY SWING ROUND TO WHITE MEAT. I'VE BEEN A YACHT CHEF FOR NINE YEARS NOW. CHICKEN WILL BE HERE, BUT IT'S NO BIG DEAL, BUT IT'D JUST BE NICE IF THERE WAS A SLIGHT WAVE OF COLOR. I AM ESSENTIALLY MY OWN BOSS, SO I CAN BE AS RIDICULOUS AS I WANT. WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT SOME OBSCURE ITEMS LIKE ALLIGATOR AND OXTAIL. WE HAVE AN UNLIMITED BUDGET. THAT'S FOIE GRAS, YEAH. - ABSOLUTELY. - DO YOU LIKE IT? - I LOVE IT. - I COULDN'T AFFORD IT. - EVERY MEAL I MAKE IS PROBABLY SO UNIQUE THAT I'VE NEVER EVEN DONE IT BEFORE IN MY LIFE. THAT CLIENT WILL NEVER, EVER GET THAT DISH EVER AGAIN, UNLESS FROM ME, AND THE CHANCES ARE I WON'T EVEN REMEMBER IT, SO I HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT. [laughs] GOD, EVERYONE'S GONNA EAT PRETTY WELL THIS TRIP. - [laughs] - BUT I'M A CONFIDENT CHEF. THAT DIDN'T SOUND ARROGANT, DID IT? - SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE REST OF THE CREW SO FAR? - ACTUALLY, I WASN'T REALLY SURPRISED. I MEAN, IT'S STILL EARLY, BUT-- - HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THIS INDUSTRY, DID YOU SAY? - I MEAN, I'VE BEEN SAILING MY WHOLE LIFE. MY FAMILY FIRST CAME OVER ON THE MAYFLOWER. MY FAMILY IS A BIT OF A BLUE-BLOOD FAMILY. I DEFINITELY GREW UP IN A VERY PRIVILEGED LIFE. AND MY FAMILY STARTED ONE OF THE FIRST WHALING INDUSTRIES IN NANTUCKET. SO IT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME, AND I JUST--I'M-- I WANTED THAT LIFE. - I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS SINCE I WAS, LIKE, A PRIVATE. - YEAH. WHAT WAS YOUR FINAL RANK IN THE MARINES? - I GOT OUT AS A CORPORAL. - YEAH. - I WAS ON MY WAY TO SERGEANT, BUT... I DON'T KNOW, I WAS JUST... - DECIDED TO GET OUT? - READY TO GET OUT. ONCE I TURNED 17, AND I WAS GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL, I WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD, SO I JOINED THE MARINES. I FELT LIKE THE MARINE CORPS WOULD BE THE HARDEST AND MOST DIFFICULT AND DIRECT ROUTE OUT OF SMALL-TOWN AMERICA. - DID YOU EVER SEE ANY ACTION? - DID YOU SEE THE MOVIE BLOOD DIAMOND OR LORD OF WAR? - YEAH, YEAH. - I WAS THERE. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY I'M INDECISIVE. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT I CAN'T KEEP A JOB. I THINK THAT I'M STILL LOOKING FOR THAT THING THAT, YOU KNOW, KEEPS ME INTERESTED. - UM, GUESTS ARE GONNA BE HERE IN 50 MINUTES. WE HAVE TO CHANGE INTO OUR WHITES, GET THE CHAMPAGNE SET UP, AND SET UP THE SKY LOUNGE AFT TABLE. - WAIT, I'M NOT FINISHED WITH THIS SIDE. QUIT WIGGLING. - SAM, SAM. - OH, HOLLY. BETTER TO LOOK OUT. - HOLLY AND I HAVE AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP WHEN I TRAVEL, SO I NEED TO GIVE HER THE FREEDOM TO DO WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO WHILE I'M GONE, AND AT THE SAME POINT, I DON'T MIND HAVING THE FREEDOM TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO WHILE I'M GONE. - THERE'S A NEW BACK SHAVER IN TOWN. [laughter] - SO DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE THE CHAMPAGNE? - THAT'S FINE. - YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU? - I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. - THIS FIRST TRIP SETS THE TONE FOR EVERYTHING. SO YOU DO KNOW HOW TO-- - YES, YES. I KNOW HOW TO POUR CHAMPAGNE. - AND YOU TWIST THE BOTTLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T DRIP. - YES, ADRIENNE. - OKAY. I'M JUST CHECKING. THE GUESTS ARE LOOKING FOR THAT SIX-STAR SERVICE LEVEL. OUR JOB HAS TO BE NEAR FLAWLESS. ATTENTION, ALL HONOR CREW, GUESTS WILL BE ARRIVING IN FIVE MINUTES. - ADRIENNE DOESN'T REALIZE, THE MORE SHE IS ON MY HEELS ABOUT DUMB STUFF, THE MORE I'M GONNA FIGHT BACK AND TELL HER TO JUST [bleep] CHILL. - ALL RIGHT, GIRLS, LET'S GET READY. THE GUESTS ARE ON THEIR WAY. - COPY. COME ON, KAT. - WELCOME ABOARD. CAPTAIN LEE ROSBACH. - NICE TO MEET YOU. - ALEX, MY PLEASURE. HOW ARE YOU? - WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - LEE. - LEE, HOW ARE YOU? JOHNNY EYELASH. - CHAMPAGNE? - YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OOH, CHAMPAGNE. OH, SO HOT! - JOHNNY EYELASH SHOWS UP TO A $20-MILLION YACHT IN A SOILED, SOILED BATHROBE. LIKE, I'M EMBARRASSED FOR YOU. - I WANT TO SEE THE BOAT! I WANT--WHAT'S GOING ON IN-- OH, THIS IS GREAT! - IT'S FABULOUS. - OH, GORGEOUS! OH, PERFECT! - [laughs] - AH, PERFECT! - OH, THIS IS "GORG." I LOVE THIS. I LOVE THIS. - OUR GUESTS ARE JUST VERY L.A. PHOTOGRAPHERS, YOU KNOW? WHITE LINEN PANTS, SCARVES, AND-- THIS IS DEFINITELY GONNA BE A VERY COLORFUL CRUISE. - COULD SOMEONE TAKE ME TO THE BEDROOMS REALLY QUICK? I WANT TO GET THE BEST BEDROOM. - [laughs] - BEFORE THEY PAY ATTENTION. - JOHNNY? - YEAH? - SO WE SHOULD DO-- - [laughs] THEY--WHAT-- THEY ALREADY TOOK MY STUFF AND PUT IT IN HERE THOUGH. - I LOVE DOING CHARTERS WITH GAY MEN BECAUSE THEY TIP REALLY WELL, THEY COMPLIMENT, AND THEY'RE USUALLY REALLY EASY TO GET ALONG WITH. - CAN YOU HOLD THIS? - YES. - YOU NEED THE BLENDER, RIGHT? - I WAS GONNA NOT DO IT IN A BLENDER. - JUST USE THAT. - WELL, I DON'T WANT TO-- - IT DOESN'T MATTER. JUST USE IT. AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA CALL IT? - IT CAN EASILY COST 100 GRAND A WEEK TO CHARTER ONE OF THESE YACHTS, WHICH IS JUST KIND OF NAUSEATING WHEN I THINK THAT I DON'T MAKE THAT IN, LIKE...A DECADE. [laughs] NEARLY. AND YET I STILL SERVE THEM. [cheers and laughter] - OH, LOOK AT THAT! - OH, EXACTLY! - THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE SAMMY SPECIAL. - THE SAMMY SPECIAL? - IT'S GUAVABERRY RUM AND-- - THAT IS GOOD. - GOOD. - THAT IS REALLY GOOD.

[laughs] - [laughs] - HOW'S THINGS GOING? - OH, THEY'RE GOING GOOD. - YEAH? - I'M MAKING THEM A COCKTAIL CALLED THE SAMMY SPECIAL. THEY LOVE IT. - WHAT IS IN IT? - [laughs] LOTS OF RUM. - [chuckles] THE SAMMY SPECIAL. CAN I HAVE A GLASS OF THAT? - IN THE SHOWER, I WANT ONE GIRL OR A GUY. SHE'S NAKED, BUT SOMEBODY'S HOLDING HER TOWEL. - OH, LIKE, SERVANT STYLE. - SERVER. SERVICE. - LIKE THIS, YEAH. - WE'VE GOT A GROUP OF PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO ARE APPARENTLY GOING TO ST. BARTS TO PICK UP ONE OF THEIR MODELS. - SHE IS IN THE SHOWER BECAUSE SHE WENT TO SWIM, AND THEN SHE WENT TO SHOWER. - I'M JUST HOPING FOR AN EXCEPTIONALLY GORGEOUS MODEL THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE FOR DINNER LATER. OR AT LEAST COOK HER DINNER LATER. - WE GOTTA CHECK OUT THESE GUYS. - YEAH, WE WILL. - HUH? YEAH, YEAH. - OKAY, LET'S MAKE OUR DROP RIGHT HERE. - ALL RIGHT, SO DINNER'S IN HALF AN HOUR. - OKAY. - HOW'S THAT SAMMY SPECIAL COMING? - I'VE GOT IT COMING FOR YOU RIGHT AWAY. - WHERE IS SHE? - SHE JUST WENT OUT WITH YOUR DRINK. - GO--WHO?

SEE, THOSE ARE GREAT. WITHOUT THE PANTS. - YOU LIKE IT? - WITHOUT THE PANTS. - IT KIND OF REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING, LIKE, ONE OF THE WOMEN IN JAMES BOND WOULD WEAR. - VERY JAMES BOND. - RIGHT, YEAH, I LOVE IT. - DO YOU HAVE A BLACK BIKINI? BOTTOMS? - I DO. - DO YOU MIND PUTTING IT ON? - ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. - SHE'S CLEARLY, CLEARLY, SUPER INSECURE THAT SHE NEEDS TO, LIKE, TAKE AWAY THE ATTENTION THAT I'M GETTING IN ORDER TO MAKE HERSELF FEEL BETTER ABOUT HERSELF. - OH, MY GOD. - YOU HAVE GREAT LEGS. - WOW. - FABULOUS. - LIKE A BOND GIRL. - LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE THE LOOK. - CAN WE GET HER TO STAND ON TOP OF THE JACUZZI?

BUT HERE HE IS, AND I'M STUCK WITH HIM. - IS THERE A BUTTON, IF I HIT IT THAT A SIREN GOES OFF? - DON'T PRESS ANY BUTTON. DON'T PRESS THAT BUTTON! - YOU SHOULD JUST WORK THE REST OF THE DAY JUST LIKE THAT, CJ. - NO SHIRT ON? - YEAH. - I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT WHEN I FOUND THE DRUGS. IF I DON'T SAY ANYTHING, EVERYONE ON BOARD IS IN JEOPARDY. A LOT OF US PUT YEARS AND YEARS INTO GETTING OUR LICENSES, AND EVEN JUST A SMIDGEN OF ANYTHING ILLEGAL WILL TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ALL OF US. HEY, ADRIENNE, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC? - YEAH, WHAT'S UP? - LAST NIGHT, WHEN I WAS DOING THE TURN-DOWNS... [whispering] AND ONE OF THE GUESTS HAD COCAINE IN THEIR ROOM.

I'M NOT GONNA FEEL COMFORTABLE SERVING THEM. - JUST--JUST BE COOL. - I FEEL GUILTY FOR RATTING. LIKE, I'M A RAT. MY GOD, I'M KIND OF-- GIVES ME A LITTLE ANXIETY. - IT'S OKAY. - I KNOW IT'S OKAY. - YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. - I'VE DESTROYED THE CHARTER, UPSET THE GUESTS. GREAT JOB, KAT. THERE GOES OUR TIP. - IT'S UNFORTUNATE. - YEAH, IT--REALLY, IT'S-- - BUT IT'S NOT OUR FAULT. - CAPTAIN, DO YOU MIND ME ASKING WHY WE'RE GOING BACK TO ST. MARTIN? - YOU'LL FIND OUT IN GOOD TIME. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - HAVING MY COFFEE. IS ANYBODY ELSE UP? - I SAW JOHNNY. HE'S LIKE, "I JUST NEED SOME WATER." HE'S TRYING TO HYDRATE. 9:15. HUH? - IT'S, LIKE, A FOUR-HOUR-- SO WE LEFT ABOUT 7:30. - WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET THERE BY 10:00, I THINK. - DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME WE'RE SUPPOSED TO LAND? - WHAT WAS THAT? - WHAT TIME ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET THERE, TO ST. BARTS? - I'M NOT SURE. - YOU'RE NOT SURE, OKAY. - I GUESS SO. IT'S GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE DAYS. I MEAN, MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT KNOW IN THERE. - GHOST SHIP. HEY, CAP-- GOOD MORNING, CAPTAIN LEE. - JOHN, HOW YOU DOING? - SO WHAT'S GOING ON THIS MORNING? - I'VE GOT AN ISSUE THAT I NEED TO RESOLVE... AND WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO ST. MARTIN. - OH, REALLY? - YEAH. I'LL COME AND TALK TO YOU GUYS LATER AFTER WE TIE UP. - OKAY, SO THIS DEFINITELY-- OKAY, YOU SEEM REALLY KNEE-DEEP IN IT. - I AM. - OKAY. DUDE, WE'RE GOING BACK TO ST.

I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY... - IT'S A GHOST SHIP. - EXCEPT THE GUYS. - WHY ARE YOU CRYING? - IT'S MY FAULT. - OH, HERE'S THE THING. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. - YES, IT IS. - YOU HAVE A JOB TO DO. - YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? - WE'RE ON A BOAT. - THIS IS [bleep] STUPID. - WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. - THIS IS STUPID. - OKAY, WELL, LAST NIGHT, HOMEBOY WAS ACTING LIKE AN IDIOT, SO IF THEY'RE GETTING ALL [bleep] UP AND BLOWING LINES AND DRINKING BEERS WITH THEIR COCKS HANGING OUT, AND ONE OF THEM FALLS OVERBOARD, WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT? ALL OF US, SO YOU DID EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING. YOU DID EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING. - YOU WERE-- - MWAH. - ADRIENNE? I WENT UP TO SEE CAPTAIN LEE, WHO WAS SORT OF NON-- DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING. 'CAUSE WE'RE GOING BACK TO ST. MARTIN. - I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT ALL IS GOING ON. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR PLAN IS. - SO IT'S THE LAND OF NO INFORMATION RIGHT NOW. - CORRECT. - I'M SURE THAT WHATEVER PROBLEM THAT'S HAPPENING IS, LIKE, A BIGGER DEAL THAN-- WELL, THEY THINK IT'S A BIGGER DEAL THAN WHAT-- THAN MY PROBLEM, BUT I HAVE A SUN ISSUE. - OKAY. - YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO 4:00, I'M DONE SHOOTING. - RIGHT. - YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO-- - I'LL LET THEM KNOW. - OKAY. IS THERE ANY SAUSAGE OUT HERE? - SAUSAGE? ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. - SO WE'RE REALLY GETTING CLOSE TO LAND HERE. - YEAH. - WHAT'S HAPPENING? - OH, SOME ENGINE ISSUES, I GUESS. I DON'T REALLY KNOW. - TODAY'S OUR WORK DAY, SO... - OH. - HOW DO WE GET THE MODEL FROM ST. BARTS TO HERE IF THIS BOAT IS HAVING ENGINE PROBLEMS? - [inhales sharply] UM... WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOOT THROUGH THIS BRIDGE. I MIGHT NEED TO RUN BACK AND FORTH REAL QUICK, SO IF I CAN GET YOU GUYS TO GET A NICE COMFY SPOT PICKED OUT. - WAS I JUST IGNORED? - LAST EVENING, ONE OF MY STEWS FOUND A ROLLED UP DOLLAR BILL, SOME WHITE POWDER, AND A LITTLE BAGGIE OF WHITE POWDER. - WHAT? - EGGS WITH YOUR SAUSAGE? - A LARGE ICE COFFEE. - OKAY. - MORNING, KAT. - MORNING, KAT. - HOW ARE YOU? - IT WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE HANDING THAT GUY HIS COFFEE WHEN I KNEW THAT WE WERE TAKING HIM BACK TO THE DOCK BECAUSE OF ME. - DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING? - NO. - SO THIS TRULY IS THE LAND OF NO INFORMATION. - [laughs] I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. [British accent] MR. EYELASH, I HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR CHARTER. HERE'S YOUR ICE COFFEE. PLEASE EXIT THE VEHICLE, KEEPING YOUR HANDS AND YOUR COCAINE TO YOURSELF. - [clears throat] YEAH. - I AM SO PISSED OFF. I'M ALMOST SHAKING. I'M SO PISSED THAT THEY WOULD-- THAT THEY WOULD PUT EVERYBODY'S CAREER, EVERYBODY'S LIVELIHOOD, EVERYTHING IN JEOPARDY. TALK ABOUT SOME SELFISH PRICKS. - YOU'RE REALLY ANNOYED BY THIS? - YEAH. - WE'RE BACK WHERE WE STARTED. LOOK, REMEMBER THE GREEN BOAT NEXT TO US? - I KNOW, IF I PUT MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES, UP UNTIL 5:00 IN THE MORNING, HUNG OVER, AND THEN, ON TOP OF THAT, YOU AREN'T DOING YOUR PHOTO SHOOT, YOU'RE LOSING ALL YOUR MONEY-- I, PERSONALLY, WOULD BE A LITTLE TICKED OFF. - OKAY, GUYS. - MORNING. - MORNING. THE REASON THAT WE'RE BACK IN ST. MARTIN IS BECAUSE LAST EVENING, ONE OF MY STEWS FOUND A ROLLED UP DOLLAR BILL, SOME WHITE POWDER, AND A LITTLE BAGGIE OF WHITE POWDER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. I HAVE SUSPICIONS AS TO WHAT IT IS. UNDER THE CONTRACT, WE HAVE A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY. YOUR CHARTER IS OFFICIALLY ENDED AT THIS TIME, AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO VACATE THE BOAT IMMEDIATELY. THIS IS NOT A DECISION THAT'S LEFT UP TO ANYBODY ELSE... - IS THIS A JOKE? - OTHER THAN MYSELF. NO, THIS IS NOT A JOKE. I'M AS SERIOUS AS A HEART ATTACK. SO SOMEBODY WILL ESCORT YOU, AND YOU GUYS WILL VACATE IMMEDIATELY. THAT'S THE END OF THE DISCUSSION. OKAY? GET YOUR BAGS, GET 'EM PACKED. LET'S GO. - OH...MY...GOD. - I NEED A COUPLE OF THE DECK CREW ON THE AFT DECK, PLEASE. - IS THAT JUST AN ASSUMPTION? I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. - I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST NOT TALKING. - HUH? - JUST DON'T TALK. - THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. - LEE, LEE, NASH. - GO. - WE'RE CLEAR. ALL GUESTS ARE OFF. - COPY THAT. LET'S JUST HAVE THE BRIDGE CHECK OUT. - [sighs] YEAH, STRESSFUL. - WE'RE UPSTAIRS FOR A DEBRIEFING NOW. - AFT DECK-- - OKAY, NO PROBLEM. - WATCHING THEM WALK AWAY WAS JUST-- IT WAS HORRIFIC, AND I JUST NEVER WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. - I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING, KAT, YOU DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB. - TOOK A LOT OF GUTS TO, UH, SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT. - THANK YOU. - OUTSTANDING. [applause] - THANKS. - IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU, THINGS COULD HAVE ENDED UP JUST SO MUCH WORSE. OUTSTANDING JOB. - THANKS. - I AM SO PROUD OF KAT. HER COURAGE IN STEPPING UP TO THAT MOMENT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. - WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD, SWEEP ALL THE ROOMS. WE NEED TO CLEAN EVERYTHING 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT ANYTHING COMING BACK TO BITE US IN THE ASS. - OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE NOT GONNA GET TIPPED ANYMORE, SO I JUST LOST $1,000. [laughs] - IT'S AN UGLY SITUATION. HOPEFULLY, WE WON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET AFTER IT. - ALL RIGHT. - ALL RIGHT. - GOOD JOB, GUYS. - EVERYBODY TEAM UP, AND WE'LL GET THIS DONE. - DUDE, COME HERE. - I MEAN, IS IT COCAINE? - I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS. IF IT IS DRUGS, THEY'RE SPILLING IT EVERYWHERE. IT DOESN'T SEEM VERY COST-EFFECTIVE. [laughs] IF IT HAD BEEN ME, I WOULD HAVE FOUND THEM, PUT THEM IN MY POCKET, AND THEN GIVEN THEM BACK LATER AND BEFRIENDED THE GUESTS AND GOTTEN A BIGGER TIP. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE. THOSE GUYS WERE ALL SUPER NICE, BUT, LIKE, THEY GOTTA UNDERSTAND, LIKE, THAT'S RISKING ALL OF OUR JOBS. - I AM READY FOR A NAP. - DO YOU KNOW WHERE SAM IS? - CJ, YOU SAID SHE WAS SLEEPING, RIGHT? OR TAKING A NAP? - WHAT? - IS SAM SLEEPING? - UM, I THINK SHE MIGHT-- - I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS, BUT THAT'S NOT-- - I'LL FIND HER FOR YOU. - IS--IS SHE REALLY LAYING DOWN? - I THINK SO. I DON'T KNOW. - SHE DIDN'T ASK ME OR TELL ME. I'M YOUR BOSS. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I AM STUCK WITH YOU, AND WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF WORKING ENVIRONMENTS YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN BEFORE, BUT THAT DOES NOT FLY. SHE'S ON HER OWN SCHEDULE? SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO CHECK WITH HER BOSS BEFORE SHE TAKES A BREAK? - I GUESS THAT'S-- I GUESS SO. - I'LL TELL THEM--OKAY. - IS SHE IN THERE? - UM, SHE'S HAVING A FEMININE ISSUE. [whispering] SHE GOT HER PERIOD. SORRY. - [laughs] - BUT SHE'S UP, SHE'S FINE. SHE'S ONLY BEEN GONE FOR-- I SAW HER IN THERE, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES AGO. - OKAY, I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN A WHILE, SO-- - YEAH, NO, SHE'S-- SHE'S UP AND ABOUT. SHE'S RIGHT HERE. - I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN WITH YOU FIRST. TO LAY DOWN. - RIGHT. - YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING PRESSING GOING ON. JUST [bleep] CHILL. I'M, LIKE, SO OVER HER. - IS THE MASTER DONE? - YEAH, I MEAN, THE SHEETS AREN'T PUT ON, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE. - WE'RE STILL DOING OUR JOB, WHICH IS LAUNDRY. - ARE WE EATING OUR VACANT GUESTS' PROPOSED DINNERS? - PRETTY MUCH. YOU KNOW, I HAVE THE FOOD. IT'S DEFROSTED. I WAS GOING TO DO LAMB FOR THE, UH, COKEHEADS, AND SINCE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AROUND, I'M GOING TO COOK THEM FOR THE CREW TONIGHT, AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY SPECIAL THING 'CAUSE THEY ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE. - DO YOU GUYS LIKE THESE? - YEAH. - IT'S LIKE A FUN DINNER PARTY, RIGHT? - IT'S GONNA BE GOOD. TIMES OF DISTRESS BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, YOU KNOW? - THAT'S A PRETTY DRESS. - THAT ONE'S FROM EXPRESS. THESE ONES ARE VICTORIA'S SECRET. - I'M GOING TO, UM, PUT MY HAIR STRAIGHTENER ON. WORKING ON THE YACHT, YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO GET YOURSELF READY, SO EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT I GET TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL PRETTY OR PUT ON SOMETHING NICE, IT'S REALLY EXCITING. AND I GET TO ACTUALLY BE ME, INSTEAD OF ME WORKING. - LOOK HOW MUCH MY BUTT SAGS IN THESE JEANS. IT'S GREAT. - DON'T YOU HAVE ANY GAY FRIENDS? - YEAH, YOU. [both laughing] DAVE--DAVE FLIRTS WITH ME ALL THE TIME. IT'S A COMPLIMENT. I LIVE ON THE BOTTOM BUNK. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M A BOTTOM. - I KNOW, LOOK AT THAT. IT LOOKS LIKE A BLOODY CAVEMAN'S FEAST. - OH, YEAH. - WOW, WHAT A PRETTY-LOOKING TABLE. - OKAY. - THERE WE GO. THANK YOU FOR DINNER, BEN. - CHEERS. - THANK YOU, GUYS, FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK. - GREAT CHARTER, EVERYONE. GLAD IT LASTED SO LONG. - GO, CREW. IT'S NICE MEETING AND WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. - WORKING? - LIKEWISE. - ARE WE WORKING RIGHT NOW? [laughs] - [chuckles] - THIS IS AMAZING. WE WORK SO HARD MAKING THAT BOAT LOOK ABSOLUTELY PERFECT AND PRISTINE SO THAT SOMEONE ELSE CAN ENJOY IT. NOW, WE GET A CHANCE TO ENJOY IT. - THAT MEANS WE COULD GO OUT TONIGHT AND COME HOME TOMORROW. [laughter] - THAT SOUNDS RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY, KAT. - BEFORE I GOT INTO YACHTING, I WAS A GYM JUNKIE, AND THAT'S HOW I RELEASED MY STRESS. THE PAST TWO YEARS, IT'S TIME OFF, TIME TO DRINK. IS TOMORROW A BLACKOUT DAY? - YOU MEAN YOU'RE GONNA GET BLACKED OUT? - NO, THAT'S TONIGHT. [laughs] - WHO WANTS TO BET RIGHT NOW THAT KAT IS NOT READY TO GO AT 9:30? - YOU KNOW WHAT? I DIDN'T EVEN SAY I WAS GONNA ATTEMPT. [laughter] - DISCO NAP, TEN MINUTES. [laughter] - NO, THAT WAS SAM. [laughter] - I TOOK, LIKE, AN ACCIDENTAL TEN-MINUTE NAP, ALL RIGHT? I LAID DOWN-- - I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT-- - AND NOW-- - SPEAKING OF WHICH, IF EVER YOU WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN-- - I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, IT JUST HAPPENED. [laughter] - BEFORE YOU EVER EVEN ACCIDENTALLY CRAWL INTO BED IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, IT'D BE REALLY GREAT IF YOU TOLD THE PERSON WHO'S IN CHARGE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING WORKING ON A YACHT, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW WE OPERATE. THERE'S A LOT TO DO, AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN. - ADRIENNE, COOL YOUR JETS. - I TOOK, LIKE, AN ACCIDENTAL TEN-MINUTE NAP, ALL RIGHT? I LAID DOWN-- - I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. - AND NOW-- - SPEAKING OF WHICH, I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING WORKING ON A YACHT, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW WE OPERATE. THERE'S A LOT TO DO, AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN-- - ADRIENNE, COOL YOUR JETS. I WALKED IN THERE TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF MY ROOM, I GOT UP ON THE BUNK, AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, I HAD FALLEN ASLEEP FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND I WOKE UP PROMPTLY AND CAME BACK OUT. - WHAT THE [bleep] IS WRONG WITH YOU? IF SHE WANTED TO CONFRONT ME ABOUT THAT, YOU DO IT AFTER DINNER WHEN IT'S JUST YOU AND I. - IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE, IS WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU. - WELL, IT WAS UNAVOIDABLE, AND IT JUST-- - I FIND THAT REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE. - IT HAPPENED. - REALLY? DO I LOOK LIKE I'M THAT DUMB? REALLY? I'M HAPPY TO GIVE YOU GUYS A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK IF YOU NEED IT. WHEN YOU NEED IT, YOU CAN ASK ME. - IF I--IF THAT'S WHAT I HAD-- - IT'S DISRESPECTFUL FOR YOU TO DO THAT OTHERWISE. - IF THAT'S WHAT I HAD INTENDED, I WOULD HAVE ASKED YOU. - SHE'S GOT THAT SMIRK WHERE SHE JUST THINKS SHE OWNS THE WORLD, AND I THINK THAT IT REALLY WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE DYNAMIC FOR ME IF SOMEBODY LIKE ALEKS BACKED ME UP ON THAT. - WHAT IS SHE DOING? EVERYONE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME. DON'T SPOIL THE PARTY. THAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE OF ME AND HER ON MANAGEMENT, IS I DON'T ATTACK MY CREW, ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF PEOPLE. - GIVING HER A LITTLE TASTE OF HER OWN MEDICINE, AND I PUT HER IN HER PLACE, AND IT FELT REALLY GOOD. - I LOVE YOUR GUMPTION... [laughing] YOUR DEFENSIVENESS. - THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED. - "COOL YOUR JETS." [laughs] - I'M NOT TRYING TO BE THE ONE WHO TALKS BACK OR DISOBEYS OR WHATEVER, BUT, LIKE, I CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH. - YOU KNOW, IF THESE TWO ARE ALREADY BUTTING HEADS THIS FAST, IT MIGHT GET UGLY. - THIS SEASON ON BELOW DECK... - BYE. - BYE. - BYE. - MWAH! - YES. - [screams] - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE ON CHARTER, YOU GET BACK, IT'S LIKE A RACE TO SEE WHO CAN GET OFF THE BOAT AND GET A BEER IN THEIR HAND FASTER. - GO, TEAM. [cheering] [laughter] - THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT OF PEOPLE HOOKING UP. - "WANT TO SEE MY TITS? AH!" - YOU KINDA HAVE A CRUSH ON CJ? - YES. - I'M LIVING IN A CABIN WITH ANOTHER GIRL. - THEN YOU SHOULD BE [bleep] HER. - YOU TAKING A SHOWER? - MM, I MIGHT RINSE OFF. - SAM AND CJ JUST NEED TO GO AND BANG AND GET IT OVER WITH. - YOU KNOW, STUFF HAPPENS. [laughs] - ABANDON SHIP, GUYS. GET IN YOUR STATIONS! - "ABANDON SHIP 'CAUSE YOU ALL SUCK." - OKAY, SO LET'S JUST BREAK IT DOWN TO SEE WHY IT ALL WENT WRONG. - JUST BRING ME A PLATE. - [bleep] CHILL. - THESE GIRLS DON'T TRUST ME, THEY DON'T RESPECT ME. LAST NIGHT, I KNOW THAT YOU WERE DRINKING. DON'T LIE TO ME. - OKAY, YOU LITTLE RAT. [imitates rat nibbling] - DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG? - FROM DAY ONE, YOU'VE BEEN YOURSELF. I AM UP TO HERE WITH YOU. - THIS IS MY CAREER. YOU CAN TALK ALL THE [bleep] YOU WANT, IT'S NOT GONNA BRING ME DOWN. - I GOTTA HAVE A FIRST OFFICER I CAN COUNT ON, AND RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE NOT IT. WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT ABOUT THAT, SAM? AND WHY IS THAT SMIRK ON YOUR FACE? - I HAD SUCH GREAT HOPES FOR THIS. IS IT JUST THESE PEOPLE AND, LIKE, THIS BOAT? - COULD I PLEASE GO FOR A STROLL DOWN THE DOCK? - NO. THIS IS GONNA BE UGLY. - I'M OUT. - DUDE, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. [alarm sounding] - THERE'S A FIRE. - FIRE ALARM. - ALL CREW, ALL CREW. - [bleep]. - SAM? - WE HAVE A FIRE IN THE CREW GALLEY. FIRE IS NOT GOING OUT WITH CO2. THE EXTINGUISHER IS OUT. THE MISTAKES THAT YOU'RE MAKING COULD BE FATAL.
