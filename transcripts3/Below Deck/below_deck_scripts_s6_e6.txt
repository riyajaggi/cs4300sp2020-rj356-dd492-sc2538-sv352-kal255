[hip-hop music] - Cap's coming down. Let's tighten it up, people. ♪ ♪ - That was an interesting charter. - Yeah. - I think the only thing that worked harder than we did on that charter was our bandwidth. - Mm-hmm. [light chuckles] - I think we have a lot of people here that have a lot of talent, and I think where we're having a slight breakdown is utilizing that talent and communicating information from one department to another. - I agree with Captain Lee. It was a sh--show of a charter. But from this point on, it's gonna be different. - Overall, I think we had a really good charter. We, uh, ended up with $15,000. $1,250 apiece. Nicely done. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - Thanks, Cap. - So, you guys can go out tonight, spend some tip money. We got a short turnaround... - Cool. - Let's finish out the afternoon, stay busy. Enjoy Tahiti. Thank you, guys. - It will be raining tonight. - [Lee laughing] - Pay up, Ross. - Stop being angry. - Are you okay? It's fine, it's fine. I just... - No, it's not fine. - I don't know what's happening, but it's not going... - Same one? - Captain, Captain, Kate. - Go. - We need to organize another doctor's appointment for Caroline. - Not a problem, I'm on it. - Thank you. - Thank you. - If we can get mast, that crow's nest, in front of the windows, and most of the sundeck done, then we'll be looking good. The faster we get it done, the sooner you can have your beers. [lively music] - [pants] "Shweating." - Okay, bye, get better. - Thanks. - Get the good drugs. - Okay. [funky electronic music] ♪ ♪ - Like, this is, like, one of the things that will piss me off, is when you don't put your tools away. Like, I just found your bucket and your chamois from last night. - No, that's not correct. - Did you hot-chamois? - Yes, I did, and I did put it away, so you're gonna have to ask whoever was on early mornings this morning. - Okay, well, that's what happens when you start not putting things away, is you get blamed for it. I'm definitely under the microscope right now. My department isn't operating the way it should. I don't want this to reflect badly upon me anymore, and it's one thing after another. - Yeah, maybe check with Ross and Ashton as well, 'cause I did put all my things away. - I'm not asking much. Just put tools where you got them from. Plain and simple. - [groans] - What the (BLEEP)? - ----ing ridiculous. [slow hip-hop music] - Oh, (BLEEP). [whimpers] ♪ ♪ - Here she comes.

Josiah and I have already been doing all of her work... - [sniffles] - Don't cry. We want you to get better. But I'm not gonna carry her weight all season. - Okay, thanks, appreciate it. [sniffles] - So then there were two. Can you start folding and laundry please? - ♪ Laundry turns around ♪ [upbeat synth music] ♪ ♪ - [sniffles] Ow. ♪ ♪ - Ready, bruh? - Just about. - Let's see how far you can go. ♪ ♪ - No, I really wish I was going. Hard-core FOMO. - I don't think you'll miss much. - Why are you pissed? - It's just, everything's building up. - I can guess: It's Chandler. Has it been getting worse or staying the same? - It's just the same. Every day, he's just a pompous ----ing prick. [knocking on door] - Come in! - How are you feeling? - I feel really sore. - Well, just stay horizontal, 'cause I want you to get better. - I promise. - Miss you. - Have fun for me. I'll rest for you. - Yeah, I'll have a great time. - All right, are we ready? - Caroline, come on. - Caroline's staying. She's got elevator foot. - ♪ Need some dancing shoes ♪ - Rhylee, you're looking hot. - Thanks, Ash. ♪ ♪ Are my boobs even? - No one's gonna be looking if they're hanging even, I promise. - I love our entire crew... even Rhylee. [laughter] I'm serious. - The fact that you had to say that makes me question the authenticity. - Let's go, guys, we're here. - Come here, princess. - Whoop, my ass is coming out. - [mumbles] - [burps] Excuse me. - Rhylee, you can't be doing that when you look like that.

Come over. - Hey. - I missed you. - I missed you. - Oh, yeah. - Enjoy. - Is it good? - Bon appétit. - Please chat to Rhylee. She's hectically emotional. She's at that point where she's gonna pop. - I'm irritated to the point where I'm ready to ----ing go talk to Captain. - It would be a good idea to let her know, just be like, "Look, let's play nice, let's have fun," because I don't want her to explode. - With the way we left the workday, I don't wanna be the one to do that. - We definitely have to figure the situation with Rhylee out. She's not going anywhere; she's part of the team. We need to just sort it out and get past the issue. I can already see what's gonna happen. She's gonna have a few vodskies in her, and it's gonna be (BLEEP). - Are we going downstairs, or what? Let's go, let's go. - My goal tonight is not to set anybody off, but if I get drunk and stupidly do something, so be it. [lively club music] - Ha-oh! Whoa! ♪ ♪ - [laughs] - Yes, you can. ♪ ♪ - This is like, "Dirty Dancing" Tahitian nights, and any girl on the floor is the Jennifer Grey to Ashton's Swayze. ♪ ♪ [laughter] [bright hip-hop music] Yes, Ashton!

Ashton's looking for a hookup, but that's not happening, Ashton. I'll have fun with you, but I'm not gonna be stupid with you when you're drunk. [moans] - That's my Tahitian punch. - Ah, Caroline, where in the (BLEEP) did you come from? Can you just-- you're supposed to be resting. Can you go and rest? Where's the toilet? Where--[chuckles]-- where's the toilet? Is that it? - [whispering] - Are you serious? Come on now, that's just disrespectful. Hi. - Hi, sorry. - Do you want to lay down in a guest cabin? I want you rested, because after two days... - Yeah, I can, but will you look at it? I think it kinda went down a little. - Oh, I don't wanna know right now. After two days, we'll decide if you can stay or go. Let's take you down to a guest cabin right now. - Okay, can I just get my stuff? - No, I think you should just rest. I can get it for you. - I don't need it, it's okay. - No, I will get it for you, but I don't want you getting distracted and then bumping it. You know? - [grunts] - It's still swollen. - Well, it is, but I feel like it went down. I really do. - Okay, stay here... - Okay... - Two days. - I can't leave for, like... - No, this is your new home base for two days... - Okay. - Because we-- if you're not healed after two days... - I--I know, I'm very aware. - You know, so let's take it very seriously. - I know there's rank, but I'm a human being. I don't deserve to be treated this way. - After two days, either you're better... - [sniffling, sobbing] - Or you're not. [tense percussive music] This isn't even a personal thing with Caroline. This is her foot. It's seriously injured, and she needs to give it the proper rest it needs to heal. Get better or go home. - [sobbing] - Next on "Below Deck"... - It's a four-day charter: ten people, two of them children. - Hi. - Master Pierson is not loving the vegetables. I don't know what pain you're experiencing or what level, I just need to know if you can work at 100%. - Chandler's just told me something on the foredeck. - Okay, got it, I'm standing by. - Where does this attitude come from? - Calm down, Ashton. - Kate, it's Albert. We've had enough of this experience. - I'm so sorry to hear that. Is everybody all right? - We have towels, no water. - You have one job, deckhands. Captain, would you like some dinner? - No, I'm gonna eat somebody's ass for dinner. I am not gonna finish the season this way. I will make some changes, and not all of you are gonna be happy.
