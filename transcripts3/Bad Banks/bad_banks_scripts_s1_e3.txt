 Drink this. Thank you. I brought you here right away. No one saw you like this. You must take care of yourself. I visit a Turkish bath twice a week. Have them massage me. Scrub my old skin off. Relaxing is part of being professional. You don't have to tell anyone. Congratulations on Leipzig.

 The Global had a project called Quaestus. If was a huge flop but was sold nonetheless. And no one knows why. Okay. I will look into it. Keep it up... Do you like it? Do you notice anything? We had an agreement. Exactly. It's alright. Hi, boss. It's broken. Oh!

 Let's have a look. Your deal with Schuliheiss was a one-time thing. Understood? And if you do anything against my wishes again, I won't wait for the results. I will fire you that very day. Understood. If we don't... - Hello. - Hey. If we don't close in four weeks, Leipzig will sue us. - Okay? - Okay. So. You got us into this, so you will fix it. You're in charge of the project. Yes. Dove, get up. The fucking phone please. Thanks. Call your mummy later. The closing for Leipzig 2025 is in less than four weeks. Four! Yes. That means that all securitized loans must be sold by then. Admittedly, that's not much time. I hope you all brought your toothbrushes. You look good. Cancel all appointments. Eat plenty of white bread. Yes, white bread, so you don't hove to constantly crap. Here's the crazy woman responsible for all of this. She's in charge of the project. Jana Liekem. I don't know why you Dutchmen talk so much. You heard it. Four weeks is not much. But I'm very optimistic that we can do it. - Okay. - Close it. Adam, you know people of the pension funds. - Can you fake on Double B? - No. Adam is an expert on gorillas and perverts. And alpha males. So you will take over the entire risk tranche? Oh yes. Will you handle the final of the roadshow? Okay. Good. Then let's go. This is the project team Leipzig 2025. Adam. Get to work! We have much to do. Michi, how's your divorce going? Have you heard of Leipzig 2025? Laurie, how are you? Here are the A trenches of 80 base points. 25 swaps. 20 it is. Great. I will send you the files. Thanks. My regards to Robert. Bye. If things continue like this, I won't need you or you or you anymore. I don't need you. I make the best trades myself. How is Adam? Something is wrong with him. Why? He has so many allergies. Who is allergic to chili? He wouldn't be able to drink this. Chili... And I think his wife beats him. Pardon? He's always covered in scars. That's right. Like yesterday. His wife. Hm. And your family? Oh, excuse me. The food is hot. No problem. I will make you another dish. Here you go. Thin chicken strips? Correct €5 please. Okay. So you don't won't to talk about it. Cheers. Cheers. Mattias! Hey! This is the last round for today. You're cleaning that up. Black Stone Silver Mountain is a shell company in a worthless palace here. Bloody bastards. But Quaestus surely isn't the only thing they dumped with Silver Mountain. Mum. I might be able to determine... I need money. - What is it? - They're gone. Antoine! I always tell you to speak slowly. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry I couldn't answer earlier. We're so busy. No problem. Shall we Skye tomorrow? Sure. Okay. How was Flo's trip? It was nice. A slide. Okay. I think things will be calmer tomorrow, so we will talk then. Okay? Okay. Good. Kiss Flo for me. I will. Until tomorrow. I miss you both. Bye. How is she doing in Frankfurt? Frankfurt. Frankfurt. Shall we eat with Mummy? Yes? I'd like that too. What shall we cook? Quaestus led us to the hedge fund Silver Mountain, headquartered in Bahrain. The Global constantly sold them useless junk. You think Silver Mountain is a secret subsidiary of the Global. They're selling their junk to themselves to improve their balances. But I need proof of that. Do you get along? Fenger and you. Yes. If you can get access to his computer, you will certainly find something. His computer? Last time, you had scruples too. But then it was easy. I'm sure you will find evidence in his computer's master data. I need more evidence, accounts, sold products. Who do you think I am? Sneaking into his office, hacking into his computer. I don't even know how to do that. I don't have any other options. What do you even need it for? I'm not doing it. Get used to the idea. Am I locked in now? Oh, come on. What is this? We're canceling this. I can see that you're in pain. We're here already. Give me the keys. So we will tour the city. We've never been to Frankfurt together. Frankfurt. Frankfurt. I know that this is totally naive. But there are more important things now. Give me the keys. Close your eyes. Do you remember how happy you were? - Yes. - Relaxed? Close your eyes. Think about Thailand. Hm. Instead we're in this ugly hotel room because of this stupid project. Instead of the two of us... Instead of the two of us flying around the world? What do I do while we travel the world? You will never experience this. Do you realize this? I will ensure that the financing is secured instead of flying to Thailand and waiting for my death. I don't care what other people do in their last weeks. Whether they're lying on the beach or partying. 11 years. I've fought for this for 11 years. That appointment out there, that's my job, and my job is my life. Can I count on you? Where is he? No one is here, and his mobile phone is off. Finally. You're so stupid. You didn't order until 3 hours ago, and now you're complaining! I'm sorry. I'm hysterical. Why don't you cook it yourself? No. Please. It's my mistake. Have you gone completely mad, you stupid bitch? Clean that up. Don't embarrass me further. #SmartCityRising, Leipzig 2025. Wow! Sadly, I'm too young to say that I'm too old for this. Thank you. Yes, I'm too old. Too slow. But ladies and gentlemen, I don't believe in fairy tales. But Leipzig 2025 is an insane project. These past days, my young colleague Jana Liekam has sold credits totaling €1 billion. Yes. Come here. Say something. Good luck. Thank you. Leipzig 2025 is more than just lucrative financing for you to invest in. It's also a project with heart and soul. And representing Leipzig is it's Mayor, Peter Schulfheiss, whom I'd like to ask to come up on stage. Thank you, thank you. In recent years, large-scale projects weren't really popular...in politics. I had to pass a test or two myself. That's why it's so much more touching to see the many young people who, like me, believe in offering others a vision, creating housing, affordable housing, giving them jobs. In short,  being part of developing a booming metropolis' future. The future of my hometown. Thank you. Hey! That's the way it is. Dads care dads and family is family. They're always right. At least we got to meet your family that way. I liked it too. - Fuck off. - Oh! - Hey! - Cheers! May I introduce you to my wife? Lucio! Let go off me! Let go off me! What's wrong? Please. Please. So that's Gabriel Fenger's wife. What about Gabriel Fenger's other big secret? Do you know what's being said about you? Who are you again? I'm Mohammad from accounting. Ah, okay. What rumor is that? I'm just saying it's all drivel. Gabriel. Hey. Hi, Gabriel. Hello, hello, hello. How are you? Tell me. Which rumor? I don't know. Tell me! Gabriel. You might live in this bank. Who said it? Did you? No. I don't even know you. I don't know who you are! I don't know. Hey! Hey, Gabriel! Stop! Are you mad? Hey! Who the fuck are you, man? You asshole! I don't even know him! It's cool. I went to university with him. She looks just like the prostitute whose face I came on yesterday. I can't believe it. You've improved in recent years. You're fighting on the wrong side. You work yourself to death, but do you have your million? We really hit the ground running then. What happened to you? Dessert? The bill, please. Adorn, you will get the offer for this Leipzig thing tomorrow. I must have all of the risk shares. Got it? Cool. We have to party again soon. You know how to do so. We will see. Come on. Fuck the family! I still have those photos of yours. Oh God! By the way, your wife will get them, it you turn down our offer. That's not funny. Not of all. Shall I give you a ride or will you take the tram? I will pay now. Tom! Tom! We have to talk about the photos again. Keep cool. We're going to make you a fair offer. Tell me that you were toking. Want to come to the "Atelier" for old times sake? Old-school bukkake. Wow! Keep cool. This is my family. I have your photos too. But I don't have a family. This deal is important to me. Accept the offer. Sorry, buddy. There's no other way. I'm alive. It's okay. Hm? Jana, do you want to know my real secret? I don't understand my job. In the '90s with all that trading, I made so much money. I was happy... Then there was investment banking. Made even more money. So much fucking money! But every time, I really tried to understand where the money came from? Why? Why do these bills come out of the machine? Somewhere in my line of thought, there's always the point where I just didn't understand it. I once knew a phenomenal banker who said, We align our entire life based on what we want to understand and those things we don't won't to understand. I understand you. Hey, Mohamed! What are you doing? I will just address this quickly. I will apologize. Shush. You're both totally drunk. Okay? Fenger asked me to analyze wire transfer from the master data. But I didn't download anything. You have to go to the data center. Okay. Okay. Could you tell me more about Queastus? - Quaestus? - Yes. I've seen so much shit in this bank. If they want to fire me, I have... Is something wrong? No. Let me take you home. You can't drive like this. Mo? We're here. Good night. Thank you, Jana. No reason to get nervous. Do I look nervous? We discussed appropriate compensation back then. Given what Silver Mountain entailed last week, my compensation isn't appropriate but a joke. This was a one-time... It would have been one-time had you used Silver Mountain once to get rid of junk. But lust week's amounts were... Yes, I got it. I will take care of it. Quaestus? It's all going downhill. €1.10 now for a coffee. I will catch up. Hi, gorgeous man. Hey, beautiful woman. What are you doing here? Visiting you. I'm sorry I didn't respond. I thought your phone was broken. No, no... I'm just really busy. I'm not wearing anything underneath. Do you have a boiler room? I have a date now. We have to study for tomorrow. Did you not hear me? I did, but I'm just so busy. Can I help you? Maybe another time. Bye. Will you call? Just keep walking. Sorry. You again! Do you not have a home? I wanted to ask it you'd like to have dinner with me. - Grazyna. - No. Please. Pretty please. What self-confidence. Last time, you cried here like a child and told me what a bad guy you are. That wasn't even my best side. Oh? Your shift ends of 7:00 o'clock, doesn't it? I will pick you up half past the hour. I will find a nice restaurant for us, and you will choose something good from the menu. I look forward to tonight. See you soon! What is it? I found a client. One. One client. That bloody pleb Tom Moldovan. Wow! With can offer I wouldn't even wipe my ass. I will keep searching. But if I fail, we will at least have Moldovan. Have you gone mad? The risk tranche makes up 10% of our entire credit volume. Tom Moldovan can choke on his offer. - Yes... - No, no! You're going to find something better. Mhm. Good. I've told you from the start that we didn't have enough time. I'm telling you to do your fucking job! Acquire a customer, who won't insult me with such a measly offer. Yes, Sir. Ay, sir. Love you too. The closing is in two weeks, and only half of AAA is gone. Then why are all of you still sitting here? Think of something! Hello, it's Adam Pohl again. Okay. I will fry again tomorrow. Adam, can we discuss the situation? Please trust me. I have a bad feeling. Jana, just let me do my job. Okay? Good night. What? Fuck! And? How are things? I... I just have to... Jana, wait a second. Hey. Hey. Wait a second. I just had bad food. Calm down. Calm down. Leave it. Breathe. It's okay. Sit down. It's okay. It's alright. Sit down. Breathe! Breathe! Deep breaths. Yes. Breathe. Breathe. This panic is just in your head. Don't fight it. Breathe. Fearful people are the most dangerous. So feel free to be afraid. This pressure and this responsibility, that's difficult... But you get used to it. And at some point, the panic goes away. Trust me. Calm down. Shall I see you tomorrow? Yes? Take care. Jana? Yes. Hello. I'm sorry for calling so late. You were right. You have evidence. I can't sell Leipzig's risk shares. We only got one bad offer from Tom Moldovan. I thought we should make a deal. You help me get rid of them, and I will get you evidence. How much are we taking about? €400 million. Someone will be in touch. - Okay. - Jana? Good job. Good night. Good night. Connecting Felix? I've got something for you. The entire risk trenches of the Leipzig project has yet to be sold. Those are the biggest tranche companies. Our problem is that we must sell our trenches for too low a price. I don't like saying it, but Jana is doing your job. What? She's meeting Bender. Hey. Who? is this? What are you doing? Felix Bender is interested. What? Felix Bender is interested? Bender is my client I will cover him. And I'm in charge of the tranche. Adam, you don't. I saw you working the past half cm hour. You didn't do much. You didn't sell any non-rating shores. What's wrong? Do I have to explain the fundamentals to you? You're a structurer. You mustn't engage in sales talks without me or Fenger. I didn't say... I will talk to compliance. They will fuck you up! Adam, I'm advising Bender. I'm not selling anything. Jana, don't mess with me. We will do it together. - Okay... - Okay... I'm choosing where to go. I know what he likes. Two minutes. One minute. Regatta! Regatta! Regatta! Stop this Regatta nonsense! It's just a phenomenon. Everyone always pretends to love a Regatta. Yet they all hide it. I don't. Not you. No. How often did you vomit? Come on, Felix. I mode if, didn't I? I have to give him credit. He vomited three times and still lost. I know it's great to talk about vomiting, but we have much to discuss. And it you hadn't had those drops, you would have made it too. And let me tell you something. Real men vomit and keep drinking. Okay. Back to Leipzig. Yes. Felix, let's party now that you're in the city. - No, no, no. - Oh yes. My sister Birgit from Romania. Of course, she also brought two lovely cupcakes along. Birgit. She's standing fall as always. What's with this stupid nonsense? I haven't seen Felix in a long time. Get to the point! Jana, lei' me do my job and shut up! Buck to our sweet Felix. Be kind to my dear Felix. Yes, that would be... A very sweet man. May we have three more shots? Do you have chili? Or could you add some of this? Chili? Should anyone ask, there was nothing in it. Here's mummy! Mummy makes great drinks. Thanks, mummy. Bye, Birgit! Cheers! Cheers. You Okay? I think I will get some fresh air. Are you okay? I will be right back. Okay. He's spent all day in the toilet. He insisted on coming. I told him not to have alcohol. Pardon? Let him defecate now. We're leaving. Is it that obvious? After all of the interactions with my business partners, I can't out myself. That would be mega un-authentic. I've just missed the right time. I won't tell anyone. I've known Leblanc for some time. It's rare that she respects someone. Good transition. How many do you want to buy? €300 million. Okay. Cool. Good. Great decision. Congratulations! Let's celebrate. You two look great together! I will show you. Like this. Off with the head. Nice and smooth. Don't waste the juice. Now slurp. So? Do you like it? After what I've done, I won't be able to work at a bank. I wouldn't want to. It's over. What do you want to live on? Are you a Mr.Moneybags? I wouldn't say it like that, but I can manage for a while. Crazy. You know, I've been unhappy for a very long time. If you have no money, it's easy to blame your luck of money for you being unhappy and not well. But it you have money and still don't feel good, it's either your character or that you feel like you've done everything wrong so far. So change your character. Stop crying. I'm doing It. I can't wait. You will see. Did you see who? the kitchen looks like again? Oh wow! Don't 'oh' me! I don't want to be the one who always has to clean it all up. What about the kitchen? Don't mock me? It's not funny! You must clean just like me. I will do it. Okay. Please. I want to live in a nice house. Yes. Your girlfriend is in your room. I don't have a girlfriend. She said she was your girlfriend and wanted to see you. I told her to wait. What does she look like? Hello. How did you know where I live? Can we talk? You can't just come here, telling her that you're my girlfriend. That's crazy! You're sitting on my desk. Just leave. Okay? Can we talk? No. No! If you knew me... I don't wan to get to know you. You'd like me. Just leave. Okay? Thao, stop. Thao, don't. Remove your hand. Ow! Stop! Stop! Let go! Everything okay? - Fuck off. - Oh! You can't do that! Let's go! I'm calling the Police! You're crazy! Tom, it's Adam again. You're not answering your phone. I wasn't able to further reduce the price. We must find another way. Please call me back. Don't do anything with those photos. I mean... it was a great joke. But you wouldn't actually send them. You wouldn't, would you? We're friends. Call me, Tom. Fuck! I've always liked... Get some rest and thank you! Need help Did you just pretend to be normal? Sabine, it's not that bad. Don't touch me, you sick asshole! Get some sleep, Flo. No. Your mother is going to kill me. Is mummy coming back tomorrow? No. - Why? - Good night. It's alright. Hey. It will be okay.
