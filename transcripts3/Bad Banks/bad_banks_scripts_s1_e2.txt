I can't say. What can you say? To me, the levels being worse than expected means that It should progress faster than expected. Your last estimate was... A few months to six months. So what does this mean? Thao if depends on how long the organs continue to work. Once one collapses, if might not be long. The worst-case scenario. That's impossible to say.

Students! Lots of little students. Damn Public Universities. Party! I'd enjoy the Global as well. Could I write you regarding an internship? Of course, if you lick my pussy. I was joking. You're not as bright as I thought. What did you think I was like? Not funny? Would you get us something else to drink? Of course. I thought you were a back-stabbing bitch. I think you're my best friend now. You're so stupid. Peer-lending, isn't it? Oak Ville Trust. You talked to George on the phone, didn't you? I think that was a different George than the one Fenger had in mind. Because when I called earlier, he had never heard of Thao Hoang. What do you want? I'm kicking you off the team tomorrow. Then you'll have nothing. No project. Nothing. But somehow that's not enough for me, because I like to finish things. That's why I'll make sure you'll be fired. Thao, I know you studied here. Check my resume. I didn't have it easy either. But it just won't work, will it? Women don't work together or form groups. They also won't go to a brothel together. We'd rather pretend to hate each other, destroying each other. I can do this too. Come. Come! Flo? I overslept. You'll have to have breakfast without me. Can you hear me? Yes. I'll come visit you soon, Flo. I promise. Flo? I have to go now. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Bye. This is stupid. Take a real one. You're mine now. Did you fuck? Looks good.

The diagram on page ten please. Adam Pohl of the Global. Please give me an indicative quote for €10 million. Leon? Do you miss her? Me too. Luc. We hove another half on hour. This is poison. Let's go. Luc. We only have half an hour. This is poison. Gel up and pull yourself together! We're meeting the lawyer. It'll be okay. Screw the lawyer! Leave me alone! Leave us alone! Vomit on your car! Could you just turn right here, 11th street? Thanks. What does the mayor have to say? I'm just leaving now. I've looked at the pitch. Great job, Jana. Under different circumstances, we'd stand a chance. Thank you. Listen, I think that timing is Schultheiß's' priority. I'd like to offer us closing in just four weeks. Four weeks is impossible. I can do it. Six weeks is already nowhere near enough. We don't do such nonsense. I'm sure two weeks won't matter to Schultheiß. - Can't I just? - I said no. Stop constantly contradicting me! We'll stick to six weeks. So I'll pull if out now and re-insert it here. We can see that we can't see anything. No matter which buttons I push, nothing's happening. Am I a programmer? Come in. I don't give o fuck whether it's worth if or not. I wont if to work again tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. Ms.Liekum. Hello, Mr.Schultheiß. I'm glad you could make ii. How about some wafer? Yes, please. I was about to show you the way things are, where this tourney will fake us, but if doesn't work. I know what it'll look like. You can see if here too. Ms.Liekum, why did you send this offer just to me? You have the final say, so I wanted to folk to you first. You've had a chance to look if over. I did. You wont to close in six weeks. Thao seems very ambitious. Yes. That's The benefit of working for such a large corporation as the Global. Time is money. That's true. Honestly, this is up for debate. I think it's possible within four weeks. How did you know? What do you mean? It's not an accusation. You're a banker. You use such information. But I at least try to hide my illness as best as I can. So tell me how you found out? Once the lymph nodes have been removed, one's arms swell up. Your skin changes, gets dry. You can no longer wear rings or watches. It's obvious... I understand. Thanks. I get it. Who was it for you? My mother. Did she suffer? If happened pretty fast. Okay. Give me a few hours to think. But I'll fell you this: If I sign, I want you to guarantee the closing within four weeks. Okay. - Thank you. - No, Thank you. Are you heading straight back to Frankfurt? Yes. What a short meeting. Maybe our next one will be longer. Yes, maybe. Attention, stage in motion. The ups and downs of the ailing Deutsch Global Invest continue. We don't really have to discuss the fact that the current lawsuits don't make things any easier. But investors and shareholders still very much trust Germany's largest bank. It's almost as though everyone wanted the bank to do better than it currently is. What? Mr.Fenger. We talked on the phone. Ah, my brain. Exactly, I'll be in your ear later. Is there anything we should discuss? I'll speak German, won't I? Yes, please. Otherwise I'll be confused. Good. I'll go up the stairs. Good luck. Yes. See you later. Your boss is there. Former boss. I didn't know she'd be here. Where are you? Room 478. Messe Hotel. In one hour. Christelle. What a surprise. Come in. I didn't know you were o shareholder. I happened to be in Frankfurt and thought I'd check to see what you're doing wrong. Are you pleased with Fenger's start? Yes. I'd also like to work with you. When can we folk in private? Never. We're not sharing the some interests. I'll cull you, if that changes. Schultheiß here. Peter Schultheiß from Leipzig. Mr.Fenger. We want you to handle The financing of Leipzig 2025. But as we discussed with Ms.Liekam, we also want you to guarantee the closing within four weeks in writing. Ah! Yes, okay. We'll prepare everything by tomorrow morning. I'll see you tomorrow then. See you tomorrow. Come with me. Do you realize that we're liable for millions, if we don't pull this off? Don't expect 90% from me. Icon only do 100. And if your damn 100% aren't enough? Will it be your head or the bank's what you're exploiting for your crap? Why exploit? You think this is all about you, while I'm trying to save this bank. Is this about you, Jana? About your chance of pulling off something great? About your goddamn career? Remember one thing: I don't give a damn about you. I only care about this bank. Go home and waif for me to decide whether I can employ you further. I just prioritized. Go home. The subject of investment banking has become a huge cultural issue these past fen years. We've all had to cope with massive criticism from governments, the media and the public. But fortunately, Deutsche Global Invest has been able to give you numerous examples of why modern society would no longer even be thinkable without investment banking. Deutsche Global lnv. profits from land grab and arms Thank you, gentlemen. We appreciate the message. We'll look into it. So why modern society would no longer even be... I'm waiting. Rest assured, all of my expectations and hopes in Deutsche Global Invest have been met so far. Mr.Fenger, you once said, and I quote, Never trust u bank that mentions security and upon further research actually shuns risks. Did you mean to say that banks have a duty to lie to their clients? The quotation is from 2003. Refer to the changes offer the financial crisis. Second question: Is that what you're doing now? I don't remember when I said that, but surely before the financial crisis, when the term "safety" was still the some as "constant investing". So in short, you're all about growth without risks. No comment. Polemic. Let's move on to the next question. Why do you ask questions that you know to be rubbish? I said we'll discuss this later. Mr.Fenger, move on to the next question. If you won't me to say I'm just as scared as you are, I'll have to disappoint you. I'm not afraid of risks, because risks are a natural component of success. The term "security" has perverted these past years, forcing people in our industry to use more crude measures. Half on hour ago, someone taught me a lesson, which reminded me of who? I believe in and when' I'd like to represent again. Growth without fairy tales about security with a healthy close of fighting spirit. Next question. I'm sorry. I overreacted. You did everything right. Message not sent. Crazy. Never let it be said that the stock market isn't interesting. Ladies and gentlemen, Deutsche Global Invest's share prices have indeed skyrocketed after Mr.Fenger's ruthless speech today. It seems that the shareholders seem to have more trust in a gambling Fenger than in a cautious Fenger. How are you? I wanted to see if you'd like to come to my party on Saturday? Yes. It will be a theme party. Can you hear me? Put your phone away. I'll take care of her. Jana. Jana.
