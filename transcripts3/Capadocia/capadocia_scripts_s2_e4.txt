 - That'll be 700 pesos. - Hold on. - Thanks. - Sure. Front desk. Can you see the whole bed? - I don't see it at all. - Hold on. Okay? No, a little more. More, more, more, more. And now? Yes, get down from there. Somebody could walk in. Andrea, you need to tell me the truth. I can't help you unless you tell me everything. I'm not your dad now, but your attorney. I already told you dad. I killed nobody.

 How long have you been doing drugs? I don't do drugs. Andrea, you tested positive for drugs. You were high. Somebody stuck it under the door, and I'm so scared dad. Teresa put me in the hole. I'd be lying to you if I told you that... I didn't want her dead for putting me in this chair. For what her bullet took away from me. Did you kill her for me? What? Speak up Andrea. You were high, she teased you, I don't know, but I need to know exactly what happened. I told you dad, but you don't believe me. I swear I wanted her dead. But I'm a coward. Forgive me baby. Please forgive me. We'll get you out of here. I promise. We'll fight back with everything we've got. They can't deal with us. And you need to be very strong. I need to interrogate her again. You've already pressured her a lot. There are still a lot of loose ends, and until she tells us... You've interrogated her already. I beg you not to. Teresa, get this clear. I don't need your permission to do my job here. Andrea's apparently not the only one involved, and trust me, I'm getting to the bottom of this. They're investigating Marin's daughter for Brenda Yamilet's death. That's one problem less for us. What about Victor Hernandez? I'm working on it. He keeps a low profile, and I don't have anything on him yet, but I'm working on it. We'll soon know if we can count on him. Go on honey. Enedina. What happened? They cancelled all my appointments. So I'll work at home for a while. What's wrong? Nothing. - Hurry up. Bye honey. - Bye bye. You got pictures of my husband? That wasn't necessary. This is a lot better. I'll be in touch. Thanks. What do you think? I think you're right. She couldn't have killed anyone with what she was on. I need your professional opinion in writing. No problem. Thanks. Is there any way to know who's doing the same drug? We could run some tests, but Victor would find out, and then his report would say that Capadocia is drug-infested. Sorry to interrupt. We need to talk when you're free. I need a criminal profile of all the inmates. Sure. Move it, first shift. To the workshop. Move it! Time is money lady! Where were you Lorena? Did you take your vitamins or should I carry you? Move it. What are you waiting for? - Sofia. - What? What the hell is wrong with you? It's my period. I couldn't get changed. - You. - Yes? - Take her away. - Let's go princess. You're not reading it? What for? I don't get all these fancy words, and I get a headache when you try to explain them. You know how much aspirin costs in here? If you read it you'd see you don't need to buy aspirin at this drugstore anymore. Your ex-boss got caught red-handed. For fraud in Mazatlan, two days ago, at his latest orgy, and he confessed everything, even that he framed you. They dropped the charges. It's paperwork and you're free. I have to tell Sofia. We're free. Not so fast. Your wife's case is different. - Move it. - Okay. You're so slow. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Could you? Sure. Thanks, we'll be right back. You should've left her home. - Hey. - What's up. Three more tapes and 40 copies. That white guy is a star already. Let's go baby. See you next week. You're not working hard enough. This isn't enough material, my friend. I can't pay you full price for so little. The guy at that other hotel brings me 50 tapes a week. Fifty, my friend. You don't even have ten. You'll have to do a lot better than that. When am I getting my camera? Have I ever failed you, Sandrita? Your kid is real pretty. If she were mine she'd have my Italian features. Your stupid features. Seriously, when will I get my camera? Tonight at the hotel. - Alright. Bye. - Bye. Silence. Silence. I've never had cramps this bad. My grandma used to say that when it hurts real bad somethings going to happen. It's the serpent's labor and delivery pains. The signs are there. Death is back. The father of wrath lives in here, the father of mockery and lies. The just approach the harlot's door. But God's eye watches over us to deliver us from sin. And if my heart is sick, He shall pluck it out. Security. Security. Security. Security. Lights out. Silence. I'm meeting with the architects, honey. I need to convince the idiots Jacuzzis aren't always okay. They want to put a Jacuzzi in a colonial hotel. Instead of, I don't know, maybe some classic bathtubs, or a firefighter's hose in the elevator. You're not listening. Are you mad at me? Do what you have to do. Please. Why are you like this? I was here all day. I don't get it. I'm not angry. It's called depression. What do doctors say now to charge more? Bipolar? That's it. I'm bipolar. Gaby, honey, as soon as the project's done, mom will look after the kid, and we'll go anywhere you say. Let's go to Paris. How about that? - Paris? - Yes. Paris is for suicidals. No. Why not the beach? Sure, the beach is fine. I know you love the beach, and the bikinis, right? But only on you. Wipe that frown off your face and take your pills, please. So you like mom's new toys? I'll make some great films with this. I'll tape your christening. It'll be great, you'll see. What the hell is this? I got it from Picacho. I'll pay him little by little. Now I can make quality tapes with this, and revolutionize the business, I swear. - Come on Sandra. - What? This is what we use to tape people fucking. Silent movies, camera, action. You got that? Action. Action. Stop it. That's fine for practicing, but I don't want to do this forever. I want to make some real movies. Look at this. "The Four Shots of the Seventh Art". See? First shot... Look. Your daddy's nuts. Right line for conjugal visits. Right line for conjugal visits. Why do you want to see me? Come in. There's not much time. Come in. Sofia. I'm a free man. But how? I'll explain everything later. We haven't been alone for so long. Wait. Please. You've changed a lot, Lorena. You scare me. Don't think I don't know it's my fault. You think I'm being cynical but I blame myself every day. I made a mess of everything. I made... - What's the matter? - I'm scared. Don't be ridiculous. Can't you trust me ever? The lawyer says it's going to be fine. Can he stop them from killing me in here? What are you talking about? What's this? You're kidding. Where the hell did you get this, Sofia? I'm telling the warden. Remember Brenda Yamilet? She shot Santiago Marin the governor. The warden's husband. Get out of here. All of this stinks. No, no, Sofia, wait. I'm not going anywhere without you, okay? It's this damn place that stinks. Just how high are you, Patrick? Now I can smell a junkie a mile away. I can dig some holes so you can stuff some more. I don't do drugs. Let go, you're nuts. If you hurt my kids I swear I'll kill you. I'll slice your balls off. You keep this crap up and I'll send someone after you, no matter what it costs. You hear me? I'll kill you if you hurt my kids. Do not come back. What's going on counselor? Hello. How are you doing baby? Is that you, N...? Don't mention my name. Pay attention. Remember how you picked flowers in the garden? Remember how we danced all night long baby? The things you told me, until the sun came up, and while you fell asleep? Remember? Sure I do. But it seems like millions of years ago. No baby, that's not the past but the future. Really Nuro? Very soon, I swear to God. I could kill him. I know what you mean. Believe me. I've been doing this for 19 years, and I can assure that most cases end in tragedy. So what do you suggest? Keep quiet? Put some condoms in his pocket? File for divorce. Forgive him, go to therapy together. Don't make matters worse. Nobody ever wins in these situations. Look Mr. Ochoa, all I ask of you is to find out with whom, how and where my husband shoots these tapes. He didn't know he was being taped. It's the joke about the camera in the hotel room. But since your husband checks in there so often, I'm sure there're lots of copies all over town. We'd have to pick them all up one at a time until we got them all back. A lot? - What hotel? - I'll find out. Thanks. I want to believe you, but you need to help me prove you're innocent. Where's my lawyer? Mr. Hernandez has full authority to interrogate all our inmates whenever he wants. How many times must I repeat the same thing? Being an inmate here is an advantage. You can hear things that can help us find out who killed Brenda Yamilet. Whoa, whoa. What are you asking her to do? I'm asking her to prove her innocence, taking advantage of the fact that she's here. As her mom I have nothing to say to you, but I do as the warden, and I'm not letting any inmate risk her life as a snitch. Don't be such a prude. We need a snitch. Who better than her? I'm no snitch. You want to know who did it? Investigate. Do your job. That's what you're paid for. Joel. You almost missed me. Why are you here? Why am I here? You crazy bastard. You know why? You know I was going straight to the cops. I was going to tell them about you, and your dirty little hands. And you're only here because it's true. No, you jerk. I'm here because I like to take work home? Your woman behaves herself, and I've saved her from all the bad things that happen in there. I'm your only friend in there, so you better watch it. Look. I've got several copies. Here's one. So it's up to you. You and Brenda Yamilet are in all of them. See you now. - Why did you kill Bambi? - No idea. I'll ask the shrink. This is what I think. The killer instinct deep inside of you was stirred up by your husband's betrayal. You can't control it, and you've even killed in here. Your last victim was Brenda Yamilet. This is what I think. You don't have a clue who killed her. You need a scapegoat to impress your bosses. Sure, they feed you and give you a car, insurance, paid vacations. Don't let Capadocia get to you. It's not worth it. You majored in biopharmaceutical chemistry. Interesting. No wonder you're the queen of Capadocia. You distribute drugs, don't you? See? We're much more complex than you think. Juan. Juan. Juan. Valeria. Is everything ok? I'm working on the files Victor wants. Let's see. Just a moment. This is your daughter's file. I'm so sorry this happened to her. She's no criminal. Why is she even here? I thought I had all of Felipe's things. That's okay. It can stay. The good stuff should stay. But they don't. They leave us. Not all of them. Alright Teresa. It's okay, let it out. I thought this was the idea of some crooked guys. But Capadocia is much worse than that. You know what this is, Valeria? A black hole that swallows everything around it. That's what it did to me and my child. It swallowed us up. My dream was to make a difference. I'm so silly. We need to talk, Dominga. It's a touchy subject. And you're not one of these backstabbers. Whatever you say Negra. How're your mom's lungs doing, by the way? Want one? Nervous? I am. We're all suspects, right? Plus nobody cares what we say. It all depends. You and your husband were in the car. Reckless manslaughter. Who was driving? What does it say? I was. Joel, right? You're a decent person, Sofia. So much so that you said you were driving. Somebody like that isn't capable of murder. I don't know, Negra. I've been doing this for nine years, and I don't want to lose it for this crap. Do the math, Dominga. How much did you make in nine years? Not even half of what I'd give you. I don't trust any of them. Just you. Think about your kids. Your mom. Think about her and her lung condition. At least we have social security, and a hospital bed when it gets really bad. Poor thing. She's treated by the same bastards that work in private clinics. But they themselves say she needs treatments, an expensive procedure. All you have to do is open the door and let the little bird out. That's it. So maybe you know who killed her. I mean Brenda Yamilet. You can tell me. You can trust me. You know what keeping quiet can get you. What if I do time? So what? What are lawyers for, Dominga? You won't get more than two years for negligence. And time flies. Think about it. We've been locked up for nine years. We're prisoners that get to sleep at home. Think about it. Two years. And that's it. You'll be free forever. Wouldn't you like to be with your husband? Get out of here? Why Sofia? You'd better not ask any questions. Just do your part. Do you trust your Negra? Or do I get someone who wants the good life? Think about it. You can go now. Good girl. End of shift. End of shift. Do you want to say something, Yolanda? No. No. I don't know. Something like what? Have you ever been in therapy? Yes. Once. - Where? - Right here. How long have you been doing drugs Consuelo? The first time I did drugs was... with Carlos. Do you want to tell me who you're seeing? Who you're talking to, and if that works for you? Who knows? What did you think was in it? I don't know. Everybody else did it. So I wanted to try it too, to see what it was like. And then in here, with Bambi, I started doing a lot of coke. With Bambi. Why with her? Because I thought she'd kill me. Light streams out of every pore in your body. Blessed art thou. That's it! Stop this BS! Ten minutes left! The one that looked the dumbest. Is this what you want? I can give you certain privileges in Capadocia. You need to negotiate with my husband. Well, well. Showing your true colors? Have you seen Joel? I talked with your Pancho Villa. But I don't know what to do with you. Your husband wants too much. Look, Victor just interrogated me and I said nothing. I don't want to talk Negra. But you need to do your part. Being the person presumed responsible for murdering and torturing Father Nicolas Valtierra Nunez, for conspiring to commit a crime, for instigating a riot, and taking hostages, Aurelia Sosa, also known as La Bambi, is hereby sentenced to serve... That'll be 700. - With a Jacuzzi. - Right. - Thanks. - Thanks. Let's see. Ancient exotic dancer. Nine letters. Odalisque. You're not that dumb after all. Alright? Alright, baby, Want to see the odalisques? Let's see. No, take her out of here. Please, she can't see this. And don't bring her back. There's no hurry. Good morning doctor. How can I help you? Is this the punishment cell? They say Bambi haunts it. Yes. - Can I have a moment? - Sure. Thanks. I have to get back to work. I'll see you later. I want you to meet someone. I want you to meet my dad. Dad, this is Montse, my best friend in here. How do you do. Same here. My pleasure. You are just as young as my daughter. That's what I say. Andrea and I shouldn't be here. But they're out to get me just because my husband is Nuro Vega. - Bread? - Yes, thanks. How about a soda? Can I open it? Yes. Would you like some bread? Here, put the wig and all that stuff on. Hurry, when the visitors leave, blend in with them. And don't forget the badge. Sometimes we don't appreciate what we have at home. I don't know. It might be a genetic issue. Or a cultural thing or an instinct. But it hurts, Mrs. Salmeron. It sure hurts. Is my husband coming outwith the whore? There's a diner on the corner. I'll take you over there to talk with him, calmly. Is that her? Stick to the plan. Miss, this way please. Come with me. It'll be fine. Don't worry. Let go of me. Take it easy. I just need to ask you a few questions. Where are you taking me? Take it easy. Just a few questions. Get in there. How many times have you slept with him? None so far. Liar. Let go of my bag. Don't touch my things. - Whore! - Shut up! Fucking bitch. Right line for social visits. Right line for social visits. Name, ma'am? Go right ahead. I'll do that. Finish the visitor list report. Your badge, miss. Go ahead. Signature and full name, please. Left line for conjugal visits. Left line for conjugal visits. Your mom picked up the kid. Did she take the diaper bag? Did you tell her to feed her at 5:00? Yes. What's our favorite actor up to? He's still waiting. Let's see what he does today. Rich or poor. They all fuck the same. Just a minute. Come in. It's open. Look at that. - Well, well, it's Batgirl. - Here goes a dissolve. And now... Cool. Cool. And now we insert timecodes. This gadget does all that? What's she doing? Sit on top of me. What's she doing? She's looking at us. Zoom in. She's looking at us. How does she know there're cameras in there? Take it off. I want to see you. Gaby. - Shut up. - What are you doing? - Shut up. - Gaby. - Shut up. - What are you doing Gabriela? Shut up. You're hurting me. Gaby, I'm sorry. Gaby, Gaby, stop. Please let me explain. What are you doing? Stop it. What is she doing? - Let's go. - He's bleeding. Let's go. This is fucked up. - Wait. - We're screwed. Run. Let go. Don't do it. I killed my husband. I killed him. I killed him. No you didn't. I called an ambulance. Back to your cells. Back to your cells. Break out! - What? - Somebody broke out. Back to your cells. Go back to your cells. - What's going on? - Someone escaped. - Where's Morena? - On break. - Who's in charge? - Dominga. Somebody broke out. To the visitor's area. Let's go. Gate! All inmates return to your cells. Nobody leaves this place. Get backup. Get all the inmates together. Now, Dominga. That's why I sounded the alarm. I already counted them and Sofia Villanueva is gone. - Are you sure? - Yes, ma'am. Sofia's gone. It's Sofia Villanueva. Notify all units. This was in the restroom. That's Sofia's stuff. - How are you? - Good. - Good? - Yes. Good. Let's go. Hold on. We have to wait for La Negra. Why her? Let's go now. She has the money. We can't leave without it. Forget the money. Let's go. No, Sofia. We need the money. She's capable of anything. I know that, but look. No way. Don't do this. I'm scared. Let's go now. Calm down. Trust me, okay? We'll be just fine. We're out here already. We need the money. Okay? What's going on? Where is my stuff? Here. I don't see the cellphone that girlfriend of yours used to film me. Sorry, that's not part of the deal. Plus it's my life insurance. I promise I'll take very good care of it, while you keep quiet. You promise? You promise. Alright. What the hell. Let's go Sofia. Enjoy your honeymoon. There's your life insurance. Sorry sweetie. Why did you have to spy on me? Hands up asshole. Hands up! Ana Moreno, Capadocia's head of security. They're on the run. I arrested them. Call in. Switch guns with baldy. Wipe it clean, two shots. Get those shells. I'm fed up of this shit. Move it asshole. Move it, move it! Is he dead? No! Talk to me. Based on the evidence against the defendant, clear indications of guilt with malice and premeditation, and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable code, this court hereby orders the accused party to be held in custody without bail. Sandra Parades Robles for producing, copying, and distributing pornographic materials, attached as exhibits. And action! Cur! Waldo, one more time, please. I sentence you to eight years in prison. Go to your therapy today like the judge ordered. If you do anything like this again, saying you're bipolar won't help you. I know, I know. I'm taking my medication, and starting my therapy. Sandra Parades Robles. Go down that red line. Producing, copying, and distributing illicit material. A film director? You can film our birthday parties. Gate. Right there. Breathe in. Move it. The worst part is I'm being desensitized. A bullet-ridden car. Two cops lying dead in the street. I went to the hospital. I saw her there, her eyes closed. You know what I thought? I'm glad it's Sofia, and not Andrea. That's what I thought. I don't care who dies as long as it's not my child. They're taking away everything from us, little by little. But we still have our daughters. We still have our daughters. To hell with everything else.
