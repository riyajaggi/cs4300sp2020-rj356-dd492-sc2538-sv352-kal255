 Don't be mad at me. I miss you and I'm mad at you because I can't count on you for anything. Not even to go to the park or the movies. - Let's get married. - Let me finish, Gerardo. What did you say? Marry me. What about your wife and kids? The divorce is almost settled. You're getting divorced? Why didn't you tell me anything?

 You'd leave your wife and kids for me? I can't be late for work. Will we meet here after work? Bye. Mom, I don't want to go to the dinner with fatso. Don't call your dad fatso. Have you forgotten anything, Ruth? Didn't you hear me, Teresa? You're going to that dinner whether you like it or not. I can't stand it when you and dad are together, trying to look like perfect parents. Hurry or they won't let your sister in the school. Like she studies at all. Shut up stupid. Mom, tell her something.

 Go on already. And be careful, Andrea, or I'll take the car away. What's wrong with you? Take it easy. I'm kidnapping you. We are going to Cuernavaca, so pick up your phone... Are you crazy? Listen to me. You'll love this idea, my love. I have work to do and I'm late, so get out. Why don't you just say you're dumping me? Daniel, seriously, I have a lot of work to do. You don't mean with that shrink at Capadocia, right? No, no, please. The last thing I need right now is a jealous fit. Why don't I phone you next weekend, okay? No it is not okay Teresa. I haven't seen you in ten days. I am not going to wait another ten days to see you. I have this family dinner tonight and a long meeting tomorrow, and you know I spend weekends with my kids, so please get out. Thank you for seeing me, father. That inmate's death really upset me. There's nothing to thank me for. There's no harm in asking a priest to pray for the souls of the departed. Those who take their own lives need it the most. How are you feeling? Any better? Or are you still blaming yourself? I refrain from harboring guilty feelings. I'm not impressed by your rationalization of everything. You went to Catholic school. Guilt is an important part of a catholic education. That is all I needed. A cynical priest. God gave you a mission in life, which you have accomplished quite well so far. So don't let what happened to that poor girl stop you now. What are those? These are vitamins the doctor recommended. Can I take a look? Turning to God at times like these can work wonders. God bless you. Where did you get that? It's a gift from someone. Isn't it great? We're not supposed to have those in here. Who gave it to you? The guy they take you to see every night? Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm a light sleeper. I know what goes on. They don't take me anywhere. I just do some secretarial work. You think I'm stupid enough to believe that? Alright, so don't tell me, you ungrateful thing. His name is Cristóbal Sanz. We have some great caviar imported just for him from Russia. And special Italian ice cream. He buys me presents, but you know what's best of all? He's getting me out of here. Then help me get out too. Really, you wanted the truth, there you have it. Who is this Cristóbal Sanz? A politician? I bet he's a politician. I don't care what he is, as long as he gets me out of here. You little Colombian you. Don't you say a word of this to anyone. I will bail her out. I did all the paperwork. As soon as the judge hands down her sentence, she'll be freed immediately. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - I mean it. No problem. We're getting you out. I swear we're getting you out. Then we'll take a vacation anywhere you want, to help you forget this hellhole. You have no idea how much I need you. The kids need you too. Patrick. Alright. I love you. Don't worry, she'll be fine. Hi, can I help you? Could I take a look at that blue one in 36-B? - Sure. - Thanks. Here you are. Is this okay? Yes, I'll be right back. - Sure. - Thanks. - Did everything fit? - Am I in trouble? Yes, you're in a lot of trouble. "At the aforementioned date and time, "this court has decided that Lorena Lucía Guerra Masiel "is guilty of murder in the first degree, "with all the aggravating factors we have seen. "She is sentenced to 40 years in prison, and therefore bail is denied". Forty years? Forty years? I don't know what happened. I swear I don't understand. She should've been freed. I gave you all the money you wanted, not one cent less, you bastard, so get her out now. - Calm down. - Shut up. I swear I'll get her out. Calm down. Go on, go on. That's it. Can I leave now? I'll give you the panties back if you want. What? You think I'd waste my time on some stupid panties? Aurelia Sosa, alias La Bambi. The Colombian's not going anywhere. The last time Teresa almost found out. Come on, Isabel. Tell him we just can't do it anymore. Do you really think I'd say no to Cristóbal Sanz? I don't think so. If Teresa finds out, Cristóbal could lose his license. No he won't, what's more, we could develop a foolproof system to get the girls out. Think about it. It's not a bad idea. We could pick out the best looking women, even design a catalog for our most exclusive girls. How much would you pay for the kind of loving only a woman who's locked up for years can give you? It's not a bad idea. Federico, just tell Cristóbal I'm not going along with this whim of his anymore. Welcome, Aurelia. I am Dr. José Burián, Capadocia's psychiatrist. I have your file. I'd like to see you later. What happened, Lorena? I thought you weren't coming back. I mean, I'm glad to see you again, I'm glad you're back, I'm not glad you're in jail, it's just that I love you very much. I even cried and everything. But weren't you supposed to be freed? Won't you talk to me, girl? Her husband realized how great it is to be single, and he sent her back in. Shut up. The poor woman got forty years. How do you know she got forty years? I know. You poor darling. You're in here for good, and the worst part is, you'll be as old and ugly as Magos when you get out. The first sewing shift starts now. The first sewing shift starts now. Mrs. Teté Lagos. I'm so happy to see you. I wouldn't be so glad if I were you. I don't approve of your being here and furthermore, I will do everything in my power to send you back. Great. Let me make something clear. I too could betray the trust that others have placed in me. Especially stuff like negotiating to end a riot, things like that. But anyway, I was sent here for a reason. I must've done something right, right? Whatever. You will obey the rules while you're here. I will not tolerate any nonsense from you. Is that clear? Sure. Return to your cells. Return to your cells. It was nice to see you again, honey. Return to your cells. Return to your cells. I can't stand it when they act like kids. You loved them last week. I grew up. Stop it man. Quit this child's play. You know I'm very mature. Let me know when you stop reeking of formula. Hi Daniel. I was wondering if you could help me out. Please take Lorena Guerra to my office. Right away ma'am. You heard her Lorena. Let's go. The person you are calling is not available or out of area. The person you are calling... or is out of area. I am really shocked, Lorena. All I can say is there is still hope. I lost my entire life when I opened that door. Always knock before entering, even at your own home, or you might catch your husband cheating on you. I learned that in here. To call a spade a spade. I caught my husband doing my best friend. She was on top of him. Then you pushed her, there was a scuffle, and she hit her head. If that's what it says, that's what it is. All I remember is Maite's hair. My son's stuffed monkey. The blood. It was an accident. There is nothing to support the judge's sentence. We can appeal. We already did everything we could. I'm stuck in here for 40 years. I don't get it. I don't. I don't get it either, and I don't care. Sometimes... I feel good about killing her. Sorry. What is it Andrea? I'm at the office. You need to go to that dinner with your dad. I am not going to argue with you. Do as you please. Okey? We'll talk later. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. We have all the time in the world. Who do I want to talk to? I've been on hold for 15 minutes. I need to talk to Antonia Salgado Benítez. Antonia Salgado Benítez. What did you do honey? I stole some panties. What about you? I killed someone 'cause she was cuter than me. She's lying. She's in here because she's so damn ugly. That's why. I'm in here for selling drugs. Unlike some of these sluts. Thank you. Are they interested? Of course not. Their interest in opening a new jail in Jalisco went to hell after what they saw. Only a dimwit like you would organize a Mother's Day party with star performers as a background for one of the inmates to kill herself. Everybody's all over us now, you idiot. Nobody could foresee that, boss. What could I do? She went crazy. You've got 500 women locked up in there, three hundred of which are mothers. Three hundred mothers separated from their kids, the day they arrived there. What did you think would happen, at your cute little Mother's Day party? What were you thinking? Answer me. Just one of them kills herself and I lose all hope of opening anotherjail. Chihuahua's governor is still very interested. Mr. Ibarra phoned. Thanks. Have you made plans for tonight? I spoke with Isabel. She says it's not that easy anymore, because Teresa works late and she could find out. I need to make a private phone call. Very well. I want her at your place at 11 p.m. without fail, and make sure she's well dressed this time. And tell Isabel to give my respects to the General. Damn you. Your hair's so nice. I can fix it up for you. Then the girl's sister comes down and says: "Dad says that either you or I have to blow him, "or even my mom, "or stop that brat from ringing the bell, before he wakes up everybody." You're hungry, Lorena? I have to eat for my kids' sake, right? I swear to God that if I only could, I would give my life to get you out of here. I'm not kidding Lorena. You know I mean it, don't you? Butjust knowing I will see you every day now, makes me the happiest woman on earth. Shut up! That's enough! What is that bitch doing here? She's a bitch to you, but a savior to me. Beat it you two. What's up Carmelita? How are you? Just the sight of you makes me feel I'm in heaven baby. You have no idea how much I missed you. Every single day I thought I'd die, Consuelo. I'm so crazy about you I gave up everything. My entire kingdom, so I could come to this hellhole. I missed you too. I'll do everything I can to keep a check on Bambi. I hope I can count on you. Daniel. Thank you so much for helping me with my paper. I'd be in trouble if I didn't do it in time. No problem. I'd better get going. Take care. Goodbye. He used all his influence to get the judge to throw the book at her, when this is clearly a manslaughter case. The dead woman's dad wasn't going to sit there and do nothing. He's supposed to act fairly and sensibly as well. Judge Cedeńo is a very powerful man. He is one of the country's most influential people. He is ultra conservative, two-faced, and bigoted. And don't forget vindictive. You're going to do something, aren't you? I won't let her spend the rest of her life in jail, for something that was purely circumstantial. Everything is circumstantial. She didn't want to kill anybody. She responded to an aggression. Can you imagine what it was like to go home and find her husband and her best friend in her bed? No I cannot. Can you? I'm not projecting her plight, if that's what you think, doctor. Give me my stuff. See you later. Do you still love me? No. I don't love you anymore. If you ever say that again, I will make mincemeat out of you and swallow it, to keep you inside of me, you hear me, bitch? What's going on? Don't start, Bambi. Stop fooling around, move it. I will kill you bitch. Who are you cheating on me with? That's enough. Is solitary confinement what you want? Yes. I still love you. What's going on? Don't start, Bambi. Isn't that what they call you? We're not fooling around in here. You already know where to go. They sent you this. Come on, they said it was large. Stop bitching or I'll take that one too. Please let me make a call. My boyfriend must be looking for me everywhere. Please let me make a call. - You're not on TV, white girl. - It's my right. Remember the young lady I was with over there? Have you seen her? No I haven't. Maybe she came back, sat at another table? Did anyone ask for me? A tall guy? No? Thanks. Antonia Medina, please. She didn't come to work today. - Are you sure? - I'm positive. With all due respect, judge, this case has been totally distorted. Mrs. Lagos, I decided to see you because of who you are, but please don't tell me how to do my job. I'm not telling you how to do yourjob. But you can't deny the fact that you were unduly harsh to Mrs. Guerra Masiel, when this is clearly a case of manslaughter. I would rather you used your vast knowledge to do your job and avoid a suicide in your jail, which was all over the media, by the way. All your cynicism can't hide the fact that you were pressured by judge Cedeńo to rule against Mrs. Lorena Guerra, and I am going to prove it. Excuse me. I have nothing to say to you. It was an accident, a horrible, stupid accident. Please let Lorena go. She will pay for killing my daughter. She has already paid in full for it, and it was Maite and I... Mention her name again and I swear you're a dead man. Lorena is going to rot in jail. Either leave on your own or get escorted. What are you waiting for? I'm dropping out of school mom. Dad will soon be President, and a President's kids don't go to school. I think you are totally out of your mind. I mean it. I'm dropping out of school. What's wrong Ruth? Ivonne had her period. Really? She soiled her pants the other day, and the entire class made fun of her. That only goes to prove how stupid they are. The same thing happened to me. Really? I had just started high school, just like you. I was playing a nice game of basketball, when all of a sudden those idiots were teasing me, because of a huge stain in my uniform. So what did you do? At first I was embarrassed, but then I decided to confront them. I walked right up to them and told them that the very same thing had happened to their precious moms. You should have seen the look on their faces. Don't be afraid of growing up, honey. I'm not afraid. I just don't want to go to school. Where are you, you idiot? Is that Andrea? She's meeting us there. Hello. How are you doing? Help me convince mom to let me drop out of school. Teresa, let her drop out of school. You see mom? I'll be in the restroom. Ruth means it. You should too. You just fool around with your daughters. What are you talking about? About your lack of commitment. Are we going to enjoy dinner or not? If it were up to me, I'd never see you again. What's wrong Teresa? I am sick and tired of not saying how I feel about you. Alright, tell the girls I'll call them later. Ruth wants to see you. Someone with the same surname is here. Is she a sex worker by any chance? She is not a sex worker. She's my girlfriend. She didn't show up for work or our date. I've been looking for her all day long. - Your girlfriend? - Yes, my girlfriend. Next door there's a guy with a little vest on, take the picture to him with some money. Tell him you're my cousin and he'll help you out. Thanks. Excuse me. Get in line please. I'm the young lady's cousin. She said you'd help me. This way please. She says you know where to look. I need to know if you've seen her. No, she isn't here. Are you sure? Do I look like I'm kidding? So what do I do? Come back tomorrow to see what we can do. My mom was a gatecrasher. Even when I was a little girl, she took me to political rallies with the party leader. Then, when it was the evening they had agreed on, she woke me up. And we'd go with all the party members. We carried lanterns. Then that same evening, we made shacks out of cardboard. What are you doing here? I'm taking the Colombian with me when the lights go out. Didn't you hear what I said this morning? The Colombian isn't going anywhere. You know what? Why don't you tell Cristóbal so yourself? Cristóbal, it's Isabel. I can't do this anymore. We could get caught and you'll lose your license. Cristóbal, please. I told you it's not worth it. Don't worry about it. It's better to be a little flexible than to get your dad in trouble. Get out of my office. I want a burger. Ruth, they have much better things than just burgers. Burgers are the best. You see what I mean dad? Where is Andrea? There she is. Who is that? - Hi dad. - Hi honey. - Meet Daniel. - How do you do. - Nice to meet you. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Good evening professor. Hi Daniel. Have you met? Yes we have. Thank you. I have been her student for quite a few years. Daniel is helping me with a paper on human rights. - Thank you Daniel. - You're welcome. I'll be in the restroom. Mom is acting weird. As usual. No, you get her like that. Girls, girls. I need to wash my hands. Excuse me. Go right ahead. Where have you been hiding him? How did you two meet? LADIES. What are you up to? I'm not up to anything, I just... What are you doing here with my daughter? She invited me to dinner. Go back to that table, make a call in two minutes, and get the hell out of here. Either that or deal with me, understood? Yes, yes. Idiot. Come on girl. We're getting you out of here. Hurry, hurry. Move it. Where is she taking you dressed like that? Help, they're taking her away! Open. What happened? She started yelling. Let me tell you something, Aurelia. That's your real name, right? You are nobody in here. You don't do or say anything without my permission, got it? Got it? Take her to solitary. Why? What are you staring at? Go back to bed. Go back to bed. Hurry, hurry. Just go in there and do what you have to do. Don't linger like the last time. Aurelia Sosa. Dad, what's peaceful disobedience? Civil disobedience, is a right the people have to protest against any decision the government or corporations make that directly affect the most vulnerable people. So I should ignore Teresa when she's wrong? It has nothing to do with that. Why not? Daniel says we should protest against any abuse of power. Right? I didn't mean it that way. Excuse me. Hello. And Gandhi made use of what's called peaceful resistance. But is she alright? I'm on my way. I'm sorry. I have to leave. Won't you have a quick bite before you go? Thank you sir, but mom isn't feeling well. It's nothing serious, but she needs me. Thanks, Andrea. It was nice meeting you. - Me too. - See you, professor. Bye. Isn't he a little too old for you? You're such a macho, dad, if I were a man, you'd be proud if I went out with an older woman, but I'm a woman, right? That's not what I meant, honey. Don't change the subject, dad. Why can't I do what Gandhi did? I'm talking to your sister. Nowadays age doesn't matter, right mom? I agree with your dad, not necessarily because of his age, it's a matter of experience. What does that have to do with it? He is much more experienced than you are, and you would be at a disadvantage. - But mom... - I said no and that's that. Can we just have dinner, please? Come on, come on. Hi honey. Do I get undressed right away? No, how are you? I'm very upset. Bambi's back. Who? Bambi? Why? What do I know? She's nuts. She's in love with me. She says if she can't have me, nobody else will. She will kill me if I don't get out of there. Don't worry. I'm getting you out right now. I'll get you a nice place nearby, just for you. How about that? Touch yourself. Get on top. Come on, get on top. - You like that? - Yes. Let me stay here with you. Can I stay here with you? Yes, yes. Yes? I can? Get me out of Capadocia. Get me out of Capadocia, okay? Okay? These men are all the same. Cristóbal. Cristóbal. Hurry. Come in. Colombian. Colombian. Yes? Is the Colombian with you, boss? Yes she is. Sorry. Consuelo. Consuelo. Hello. She knocked Juan out and ran away. Follow me, the Colombian got away. What do you want? I'm sorry Teresa. I'm such a fool. Yes you are. I didn't think you'd get so upset to see me with your daughter. Have you got a minute? - No. - Rlease let me in. What are you doing here? What do you think? I want to apologize. This isn't about apologizing. Get in the car. Should I have been happy to see you with my underage kid? Don't make this any worse for me. You don't get it, do you? I love you Teresa. I want to live with you. Stop it, I've told you that is never going to happen. What are you scared of? You're terrified that you're older than I am. But I know you love me. You know what the real problem is? You don't know the difference between love and sex. So explain it to me. That is as far as your love goes. Remember that. All there is between us is sex. Don't forget this if you want to see me again. Faster, faster! Just drive. Have you found her? What? No. Just so you'll know, I've been in Rome for two days. Son of a bitch! Take me to the nearest hotel. What do you mean she got away? You're in big trouble. I'm not going to jail because of you. So you'd better find her. Bambi's going to pay for everything she did. How so? That bitter bitch Isabel gave her a taste of that new toy of hers. Like she did to you. She went ballistic as they took the Colombian out. Where did they take her? I don't know, Bambi started yelling: "They're taking the Colombian away". I heard her yelling but I didn't know why. Don't you know they take her out at night to go whoring? What? Whoring? Does the director know? You think she doesn't know? She turned out to be a Madame herself. I don't think so. No way. I'm telling you. May I? I'm reviewing these cases. Have you talked with Lorena? No, she is too depressed. She needs some time. Time for what? She needs help if she's depressed. I gave her some medication. I can't force her to talk. What's your special interest in her? There is no special interest. The same thing could happen to any woman. She got 40 years, which not even the worst kidnappers get. Did you catch Santiago with another woman too? Who do you think you are to offer me your unsolicited advice? We are friends. You are denying something you can't accept. Lorena is here because of an accident and a judge's abuse of power. We are paid to support them, to detect these injustices, and to seek justice, seek justice, that's all. I am paid for my medical support. Lorena chose to enter that room and confront her friend. I don't know how hard she pushed her, and neither do you, but that caused her death. She chose to be there. What did you expect her to do? Cheer them on or something? What about you? What did you do? Look, do what you can for Lorena. Did you find her? Any news about Antonia? What? I was here yesterday. I'm that lady's cousin. No, my friend, there's no Antonia here. What do you mean? That's her. What's her name again? Antonia. Antonia! I came looking for you yesterday. What happened honey? I looked for you everywhere but I didn't find you. Are you okay? - You can't go in there. - I need to talk to her. You can't go in there. Francisco Antonio Salgado Benítez. I'll take your statement now. - Age and profession? - I work at home, 24 years old.
