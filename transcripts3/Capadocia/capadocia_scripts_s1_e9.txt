 She needs her medication. She's in a lot of pain. What she needs is rat poison to die once and for all. Take this crap back. I will not. No? No? No? No, please! Ask God to take me with Him. He will listen to you. Good afternoon. There are almost a million potential victims out there.

 We can't protect all of them. No part of town is spared, and no social class either. He leaves nothing behind and steals nothing. None of the neighbors remember seeing any of the victims with someone suspicious. It's as if he's invisible. What are we doing, Attorney General? We're doing what we can... That's not enough. Doing what we can is getting us nowhere. Santiago, I know the elections are coming up and... We're talking about ten murdered women. We're talking about some nutcase who is on the loose among a million potential victims.

 We're talking about the fact that we represent the state, and our main duty is to protect the people. We're talking about human lives, and the fact that we are paid to protect them, and from that point of view, I don't give a damn about the presidential elections. Let's go out somewhere, Teresa. You're going to school like you do every day, young lady. How come you can quit yourjob, and I can't quit school? I did not quit, I do a lot of work even if I'm not at the prison. Yes, JosÚ? Hold on a minute. Bye honey. Bye mom. - I'll pick you up at 3. - Right. Yes? When can I see you? I can't, I have to supervise Antonia's transfer to Capadocia. If not today, then when? I don't know. I need some time. A year, two years, a hundred? I'm not okay, JosÚ. I need to forget Capadocia, and you remind me about it. That's not true. You can't stop thinking about the women. You can't wait to ask me how they're doing. Alright, how are they? They're organizing a mass suicide. I don't think that's funny at all. Neither do I. Give me a call as soon as you can. Doctor, I'm sorry to bother you. I am Carla Avenda±o's husband. How do you do. How can I help you? I am so confused. I'm not sure it was right to judge her and lock her up. And since you've treated her at the prison, I thought you could help me, by telling me what she thinks about me. Whatever my patients tell me is strictly confidential. Whether she's freed or not depends entirely on me. I just want to know what you would do in my place. What works for me might not work for you, but I could recommend a good therapist. I don't need a therapist. Just tell me if she loves me, and if what she did was to hold on to me. I can't tell you that. I'm very sorry. Excuse me. JosÚ. What do you think about that guy? Can you believe his conjugal visit lasted all night? What's wrong with you men? His wife planned her own abduction, so she and her lover could rob him blind, and he's still willing to forgive her? I can't believe you men. It has been scientifically proven that hormones command the neurons. Don't pretend you don't know what I mean. I will not discuss my private life with you. Do you know when Teresa's coming back? You would do all of us a huge favor by convincing her to come back. Don't look at me like that. It's in my best interest. - Yolanda, that's disgusting. - This crap is full of maggots. - Mine too. - The food is worse every day. We're not animals. We want decent food. God, this is disgusting. Eat it. - But it's full of... - Eat it. Eat it I said. You see? It's fine food. Eat it. You have the hands of an angel. That feels so good. God bless you. Nobody comes to see me anymore. Not my kids or even my grandkids. Nobody. They only remember me when they need money. Their ungratefulness hurts more than my bones. But you'll understand when you're my age. Sometimes I ask myself why I'm still here, why I'm not dead yet. I'm just a wasted old hag nobody cares about. What is there to live for? Why is it so hard to believe, Lorena? Because you are so naive. Is it naive to think you're innocent and to try to prove it? You don't know what it's like to stand before a judge, hoping for the very best, only to be thrown back in jail with your life in shreds. Hope is of no use in here. I've been through this twice before. So no thank you very much. So you're giving up? Imagine if the judge sets you free. You're out of here, you go home and open the door. What do you see? My kids. What else? Patrick. He's in front of you. What do you say to him? Nothing, I would just kill him. Would you really? Maybe you're here because you think you could. Lorena, you know there are many ways to change your life, under these circumstances. Don't give up without a fight. Jorge is a faggot. Jorge is a faggot. Jorge is a faggot. They beat up the transsexual again. He was hospitalized for three days. You make it sound like it's nothing. With all due respect, you know that is nothing in this place. The warden promised to isolate him. Maybe he didn't pay enough. That is very expensive. I have to get him out of here. This crazy woman shot her employer to death. Has she filed a statement? Does she have a lawyer? She was assigned one. How is her defense going? There's nothing they can do. She was holding the gun. Nobody knows what she keeps saying over and over. The state is obligated to provide her with an interpreter. I know that, but they never do. Yes? Alfonso, this is Teresa. What a surprise. How are you? I need a favor. Hold on a minute. Juan, wait a minute. Wait. - Listen to this. May I? - Of course. Did you get that? Yes, I think she said her baby is all alone. - Thank you. - Let's go. Thanks Alfonso. Let me know if you need anything else. Good luck. Hello. I'm picking you up in 30 minutes. Do you want to see me or not? I can only trust you right now. I need your help. What for? I can't tell you on the phone. How does it feel to be rich and lucky? What? Are you kidding me? I kid you not. You had it all for quite some time. A nice house, a rich husband, cute kids. You didn't have to work. What's more, I bet all you did was some Pilates and go out with the girls. You are a good-looking girl. You know that. But I don't think the guys hit on you all the time. Or did they? You know what? I bet you won't be in here for too long. That's right. Unlike you, I had a really tough life. My family was the poorest in a very poor town. I was an ugly little thing. So ugly they wouldn't let me take flowers to the Virgin Mary. Isn't that awful? I had no friends. Then I asked the miraculous Buga Christ to make me pretty. And He did. He did, the bastard. But guess what? Let me tell you something. All my beauty has brought me is problems. Being beautiful only gets you in trouble. Being beautiful is awful. It only makes others happy. That's right. DO NOT CROSS. SEALED OFF AREA. CRIME SCENE. - This is a crime scene. - It is. Are you authorized to come in here? You're crazy and I'm even crazier to be here with you. I told you she's breast feeding. You're mistaken, let's go before the cops come after us. There is a baby here and we need to find him. You're stubborn. - Teresa, please. - Stop it. What did I tell you? The next time you send us bad food, you'll be in serious trouble. We can't afford the other suppliers. You're making them sick to save a few pesos? Nobody's getting sick. Besides, we're having serious financial problems. This is costing more than we thought, and we're thinking of ways to make it more profitable. Such as? To begin with, by taking in more inmates, then other companies will hire them. You think I'll accept that now that Teresa is gone? My boss is so glad she's gone. Teresa hasn't quit yet. You're so silly. You sleep with her ex husband, and stand up for her like you're best friends? We are all glad she is gone, trust me. You could run this place all by yourself, and your salary would be considerably higher. Forget it Federico. I'm not helping you with your dirty tricks. We've counted on you all this time. Why not now? Is he alright? Sure, at this age nothing ever happens to them. I'll take him to the hospital just in case. I'll take him. Hello. - It's your husband. - Santiago? Is there another? Yes Santiago? Now? I'll be there in an hour. He wants to see me. What for? No idea, perhaps his spies found out we had a child. Does it still hurt? Of course, that crazy woman bit off a piece of my ear. I'll have to have it fixed when I get out of here. How long will she be in solitary? I don't know. I haven't been here that long. I did what you told me to. And? It didn't work. Come on. He is crazy about you. The older they get, the easier they are to handle. Tell him you want a conjugal visit, and when he gets here, say you're sick and refuse to see him like that. I bet you he'll get on his knees and beg you to forgive him. Lorena, have some of this. That crap we had for breakfast was uneatable today. What's wrong kid? You've been acting strange since you and Bambi made up. You're not telling me? Aren't we friends? Come on. You know you can trust me. Teresa says she's getting me out. So how come you're so sad? She can't do it. I have a lot of faith in her. If she says she can do it, she can. JosÚ. Thanks for coming. Anytime. I'm sorry I had to call you like that. Nobody knows the criminal mind like you do. Somebody's murdering elderly ladies. So I heard. We need you to help us stop him. I would like you to go over these papers, and tell me what you think. It's very important. It's the guy with the red tie. He's cute. But he's such a coward. He probably thinks we want guys to respect us. Just show him he's wrong. We'd be together if it weren't for mom. It's all your fault. You had to show him you don't care what she thinks. We girls have to know how to handle them. Call him. Say you need to return something. Are you crazy? It's just an excuse to see him, go on. Hello. Hello. Chicken. Thanks. It's beautiful. Thank you so much. Do you want me to spend the night? No, my daughter is supposed to take me to her place. I'm sure she wants something. How about tomorrow? Fine. Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. You are hungry. Poor thing. Are we keeping him? He can only stay for a few days, until his mom says who should have him. Why don't you have one? I can barely keep up with you two. Hi. Look, Andrea. What is that? A baby, dummy, mom saved him and we're keeping him. So she can ruin his life like she did to us? She didn't ruin mine. - How did I ruin your life? - Forget it Teresa. What have you got against me? Nothing, Teresa. You barely speak to me, and you keep glaring at me. You're delusional. You need to tell me what you have against me. Why don't you go back to yourjail and leave us alone? We're a lot better off when you're away. Andrea. Andrea. Andrea! I didn't like Patrick. I thought he was boring. I didn't even speak to him. And? And then one day he left me a note that said: "I don't want you to be my girl. Just let me worship you". That was so cheesy. But it convinced me. When you get out of here, you will forgive him, won't you? Sometimes I think I can't, and then I remember my kids. No, Lorena. Don't use your kids as an excuse to go back to him. Do it because you want to. I don't want to think about it. Okay. Let's try to sleep and get our minds off things. Teresa. How is the baby? He is fast asleep. But Andrea is being awful. I think she really hates me. Show me an adolescent who doesn't hate his parents and all of humankind, and I will write an essay about him and make millions. I am glad Santiago asked for my help. A woman is out there killing old ladies. How do you know it's a woman? I just know. I'll tell you tomorrow. Rest, you have a long night ahead with the baby. Bye. Good night. What's wrong honey? Why aren't you asleep? It's nighttime. You need to go to sleep. You need to sleep, young man. Yes sir. Sleep, sleep. Andrea. Aren't you having breakfast? I didn't burn the hotcakes today. No thanks. Lorena Guerra. There's someone to see you. - I'm not expecting anyone. - Follow me. Mrs. Lagos is reviewing your case, to have your conviction overturned. She is? But that won't happen. The worse thing someone in your situation could do, is have any kind of hope, because this is a nightmare, isn't it ma'am? You think so? I know it. I plan to make your life a living hell. So I brought you something. It's beautiful. Thanks. "Another granny murdered". The bastard is making fun of us. Maybe we should consider the chief of police's offer. What offer? They arrested a man who killed some old ladies. The serial killer? No but he says we can pin all 11 murders on him. Right. Just to take some pressure off your department for a few days until they get the real killer. What does that idiot think he's doing, Tomßs? My office does not make false accusations to cover up his incompetence. You can't come in here. I'm sorry sir. Dad, mom kicked me out of the house. We know what happened, but go right ahead. Hi Guadalupe. Ask her what her baby's name is. Ignacio. We need to know what happened to her. She says the woman's husband killed her. Then he put the gun in her hands. Our witness saw her holding the gun. - Did he see her fire it? - No but she was all alone. Tell her I'll try to bring her baby here tomorrow. She says thank you. Am I your daughter or what? Yes you are my daughter. How come I need an appointment to see you? You don't need an appointment to see me. Try to understand. I have a city to run. I have a lot of issues to solve. All I ask is that we talk later. You and mom will be responsible if I start doing drugs and turn into a hooker. Listen, Andrea... Tell me what happened. Teresa brought a baby over to the house, and I can't stand her, the baby or living there anymore. Can I move in with you? Is that better? How I wish my kids were a little more like you. You can't imagine how they treat me. You wouldn't even treat a dog like that. Get my pills child. These bones of mine are killing me. The killer is a woman, probably a nurse or a social worker. Someone who goes unnoticed around an elderly lady. I'd say about 35 or maybe 40 years old. As a child she saw someone she loved in agony. She associates death with the idea of helping them. What do you mean? She thinks she helps them by killing them? To her, death is a way to alleviate somebody's pain. How so? Most of her victims are old and sick. Some more so than others. Women who live all alone and are emotionally unstable. Maybe she just can't stand old ladies. No, there are never any signs of violence. It's quite the opposite. I think they trust her. Then she kills them while they are asleep. Did you find anything? There is always a rosary like this one. Her symbol of death. This confirms her age. Young people don't pray. Are you sure? Criminology in this country is more of an art than a science. And your point is? What do you suggest, doctor? Find out where the rosaries are made, and ask if the woman I described bought them wholesale. And pray to the police department's patron saint. Excuse me. My boyfriend paid them to do this to me. He says falling in love with me ruined his life. The bastard. I made him an expert lover. The best sex he ever had was with yours truly. I'm so sorry Antonia. I thought you would be isolated. They could care less. The warden wouldn't know if they killed me. I spoke with him again. He's putting you in a separate cell with a 24-hour guard. How long will that last? One or two weeks? After that they'll even forget my name. Antonia, your case is very complicated. I can't lie to you. Getting you transferred is very difficult. You are officially a man. Please talk to your husband. It's not up to my ex husband. It's the judge's decision. I have something. It could make some important people help me. I've been in orgies with politicians and celebrities. You have no idea what they did. I have videos you could take to the networks, maybe that would help me get out of here. That is extortion, Antonia. I can't get involved in a crime. But you can let me die? I know you go strictly by the book, but please go to my place and look at the tapes. If you don't help me I'm dead. It's a good thing you woke him up. Pat him on the back to make him burp. Come to the kitchen. Can you cook? Sure, I make the best carbonara spaghetti in the world, and you're helping me. Let's see, I need... You look weird with that on. You'd better get used to it. >From now on men run the kitchens, while you women run the country. What did the bastard want? He tried to scare me. What a jerk. He says Teresa Lagos will never get me out of here. What a bitter old man. Not really. That was good news. He looked worried. That means Teresa is doing herjob. We need to talk business. Meet me in an hour. What kind of business? This is great. I had no idea you could cook. I'm a man of many talents. I cook, do the dishes, plus I'm cheap. Mom, he says the baby is yours and his, thanks to the new program: "Grab an inmate's baby". The doctor's also a fine comedian. - Has your sister called? - I'll check. - Hi. - Hi JosÚ. Why didn't you take my calls all day long? I didn't miss any of your calls and I've been very busy. The baby's crying. Let's take him to the park. I'd like to know what a baby's doing here. I don't have to explain anything to you. Of course you do. Andrea says you kicked her out because of the baby, and she moved in with me, because she can't stand you and you don't even know it. What's going on? I don't know. And it hurts me a lot. I've made every effort to talk to Andrea, and all she says is she can't stand me. I don't know why she hates me all of a sudden. I'll try to talk to her. I think she should stay with me for a while. Are you coming back to Capadocia? No, never. I'm of more use out here than in there as a bureaucrat. I will get Isabel to resign if you want, but I need you there. You've turned into such an expert manipulator. This is highly unethical. Is it ethical to have your ex wife and lover working under one roof? Isabel... is not my lover. But of course not. I made the whole thing up. Do not change the subject. Are you coming back to Capadocia? Ring the bell the next time you come over alone. Bambi. - What? - I can't do this anymore. Don't I pay you enough? It's not about the money. I don't want to. You're part of this whether you like it or not. Understood? I hope visiting her dad does Andrea some good. Maybe he understands her better than I do. We've all been through that phase, fighting and making up with our parents. The problem is Andrea launched a full-scale war. Would you like to see Antonia's videos? No thanks, I don't want to see older men in drag, being sodomized by some kids. I don't know what to do. Burn them. I could use that tape to get Antonia transferred, and get Lorena's appeal moving. That tape will get you killed. You're exaggerating. Don't do anything stupid. Bambi, you're acting crazy. Don't tell me what to do. I'm in charge here. Understood? And move it already. I need that fast. How is the cutest girl in town? - Good afternoon. - What can I do for you? Does anyone buy these rosaries from you? Let me see. Yes, I know a nurse who likes these rosaries. This will help you sleep. You think so? Granny! Help! Help me! Somebody help me! Help! Help! I know you want to die. Let me help you, granny. Let me help you granny. You are under arrest for murdering eleven women. Do you know Crist¾bal? No I don't. I've only seen him in the newspaper. I thought you knew him since you're rich too. Why? What did he do to you? They used to take me to him at a luxury condo. But he deceived me. I think it's my destiny to be betrayed by men. The only lover that has always been there for me is Bambi. Do you love her? I'm scared of her. She prefers it that way. If my husband had feared me he wouldn't have slept with my best friend? Of course not. Maybe it's better to be feared than loved. I don't know how to thank you JosÚ. How do you know it's her? She totally matches your description of her. Plus she had all of her victims' photos, and their addresses. She wanted you to get her. You were lucky. They almost lynched me out there. If that's all, I'll get back to work. One more thing. It's obvious that you and my wife... Ex-wife I believe? That you and Teresa are good friends. Could you get her to come back to Capadocia? You know I can't. You know Teresa. She'll only go back if she wants to. This is one of the tapes Antonia gave me. I'm sure you'll be interested. This is extortion, lady. I could lock you up for a long time, in spite of your husband. Go right ahead. You don't know who you're messing with. Not until I saw the tapes. That is those people's private business. I don't plan to make them all public, only the ones with you, and that 17-year-old kid, or is he 18? I thought you were an upright person. Forgive me sir, but you should be the last person to speak about integrity and ethics. How can you condemn the use of condoms and gay people, and indulge in this sort of thing? That is called immorality, sir. I'll have Antonia transferred tomorrow. We still need to talk about Lorena. Lorena is not walking. Then I have no choice but to use the tapes. Are two or three days enough for the paperwork? You accuse Angela Berenice Mora of trying to smother you with a pillow. Is that right? Yes sir. You would've killed your own mother, damn you. So you admit that you are guilty of attempting to kill Francisca GarcÝa. I thought your ex husband would challenge me to a duel over you. But he didn't. I'm not worth it? Maybe if you weren't so pigheaded. Have you seen the old lady killer? Isn't she a poor nutcase they're using as a scapegoat? No, I was with her. And she is the killer. When they're under a lot of stress, people say they'd rather die than take it anymore, and she took it seriously. Hello. Daniel. Hi. Do you need anything? - No thank you. - Good night. - Sleep well. - Thank you. I told you I had a long meeting. So you left your own daughter all alone and bored stiff? Andrea, do you really need to be so tiresome? So now I'm tiresome? No, I think you're a smart, sensitive girl, who for some strange reason now pretends be obnoxious. Come on. I'll take you to that rich kid's diner you like so much. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. All right. See you later. They're taking you to Capadocia tomorrow, baby. It was exactly as I told you. How are you doing at school? Have a tangerine, baby. Don't you want one? I'm sorry. I'm the one that should be sorry. I didn't want to see you, but I thought about it, and it's no use hating you. You will always be my children's father. Don't let them forget me. If I ever get out of here, I'd hate it if they didn't recognize me. That won't happen. I promise. Take care of dad for me, okay honey? Dad has another mom that loves him, and sleeps with him. Good luck. Bye honey. Let's go. Mom, are you going to stay here? Mrs. Guadalupe, no last name on record, who was placed under arrest by the district attorney's special affairs office, after charging her with first degree murder, with premeditation and malice aforethought, is hereby remanded to the corresponding authority, which is in charge of sentencing the prisoner. Teresa, Lorena is going to be freed. I don't want to talk. Is something wrong? It was your husband, wasn't it? He came to see you. It's alright. It's alright. Let it all out. Let it out, sweetheart, let it all out. That's it. Come here. Let it all out. They're letting Lorena out. A court clerk says she's getting out tomorrow. I'll tell her. Don't go in there, doctor. Get back to your cells. Get back to your cells. Make way. Make way.
