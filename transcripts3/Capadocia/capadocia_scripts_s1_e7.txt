 Where have you been all my life? Where have I been? You're so beautiful. I'm crazy about you. Totally crazy about you. Man! I love you. We're having kids, right? Mom, it's me. Please help me. They tricked me. I'm in another country. I'm in Mexico. Please help me, help me.

 I don't know what to do. Who are you talking to? What are you doing? Come back here, whore! Stop that whore! Stop her! You won't get away with this. Don't worry. Everything's alright. Stop her. Who were you talking to? She used my phone. Who did she call? I don't know. She spoke in her language. I guess she phoned home. Take a look. Let's do this. Tonight is on me.

 You can have anything you want. Come right this way. A bottle of champagne on the house? Come with mommy, dear. Call Katia. Yes ma'am. Who did you call? Answer me. What did you tell them? In Spanish. Look at me. I warned you not to touch any of the clients' things. She says she wanted to talk to her family, that she didn't say anything. Tell her to get dressed, and be downstairs in 15 minutes. I don't have much time. She'll be working with us. They call her "La Cuervo". This is definitely not enough to do business with. I didn't run some two-bit business at the otherjail. That's all there is for now. Do whatever you have to do. I need more. So dilute it. How and where? Don't you know where we are? Let her out. Get in there. Get in. This... is your new place of work. This is fine, but I need people I can trust like La Negra. You are in no position to make any demands. You can work here if you like but if not... What, you'll send me back? You're the one that has something to lose. Just a minute. You don't seem to get it. We're going to work like civilized people, okay? I'll bring you the stuff and you'll sell it. And I'll be happy to, Federico, but with La Negra. PILOT PENITENTIARY SECTION 1A This way. Move it. All the way to the end. Move it. Ruth, can you get the door? Dad. Hi gorgeous. How are you? Fine. - Somebody's here to see you. - Girl! Santiago. Hi. - How are you? - Fine. Can I get you a drink? A shot of tequila would be great. What's up? Nothing really. I booked a room for this weekend at your favorite hotel. I think... we should give ourselves another chance. This is for you. So what is all this about? Today would be our nineteenth anniversary. You see I did remember. Yes. You never remembered in nineteen years, so what's going on? I don't know, I guess I either miss you, or perhaps I'm getting old. Or perhaps the elections are around the corner, and you need to be married to run. Perhaps you are right. But the other part is also true, Teresa. What happened to us Teresa? - I'm scared, Daniel. - It's alright. What are you doing, stupid? You startled me. Don't you ever knock? I'm bored. What do you think I am, a clown? Can't you go somewhere else? Where? Dad is here. What? "I love you Daniel". Mind your own business. Go away you brat. What a temper. What's wrong Lorena? I don't feel well. You're burning up with fever. Come. Where are you going? She needs to get something for her fever. Go alone. Where are you going? Sit down. Wasn't that about 15 years ago? I wanted to be like her, Magos. Whatever happened to her? I don't know, but just look at her skirt, and those stockings. Could you give us a moment? Hurry up. Get some of those. They love those. What are you looking at? Why did you let her in here, you idiot? What do you want? Nothing. I saw nothing. Take her back to her cell until we're done. I haven't seen your boss lately. I guess he doesn't like us anymore. He's busy. But he'll be back soon. Nothing gets a politician turned on like the presidency. - How about her? - That's not bad at all. Everything's on the house as long as it's reasonable. You'll have this month's dues when you're done. - Your delivery's here ma'am. - Good. - What have we here? - They're new Czech girls. Tell them to wash up. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Teresa, I think I have a right to know what happened. Please don't start again, Santiago. Hi Santiago. Doctor. I found something that could help the transsexual. Good, good. Isn't it a little late for that? No, I asked him to bring them over. We need those papers for a new case. Come in. Okay. Thanks Santiago. Good night. I hate it when he acts like we're still married. I know how to help Antonia. You do? Isabel. Take the weekend off. Hi honey. I miss you. I was with you a couple of hours ago baby. It seems like ages ago. What are you doing? I'm having a cup of tea before I go to bed. My first class is at seven o'clock. You poor thing. What kind of tea is it? Mint tea. Would you like some? Sure. I can't reach you there. No problem, I can drive over to your place. Is your mom there? No, but it doesn't matter. I'll just slip out. She will never know I went out. No, I'll see you tomorrow. Get some rest. Bye. But... Who is this? I laced it with a little something. Enjoy. We're going to clean up this shitty prison. Hi princess. Hi baby. Are you okay Bambi? Yes. Are you having that? Here. I'm not hungry. You're always so nice. So considerate. Is this any good? - Get lost bitch. - Don't push her away. Bambi, please. Give me something. I'm desperate. Do you have any money? I'll do your laundry. Please! Get out of here. This is some revolting crap. I miss the otherjail. I'll do anything you say. Please. Whack her for me. Don't be ridiculous. She did nothing to me or anyone else. Things are different here. That damn woman is driving me crazy. Didn't they give you anything at the infirmary? No. They didn't let me in. What do you mean? Why not? - I don't know. - Look at you. You're dead. Stop it right now! - It was just an accident. - That's enough. Bitch. Excuse me. - My God. - Get back to your seats! Did you have a good time? Come on, you always do here. Say hello to the district attorney. Thank you ma'am. Look what that client did to you. You poor baby. You see? That's what you get for misbehaving. There are so many girls just dying to be in your shoes. Here you've got a home, nice clothes, jewels, money. And more importantly, food on the table. You were starving back home. You should be grateful I saved you from that hellhole. It's up to you. The problem is, there has never been a case like Antonia's in Mexico. Hello. - How are you? - Where are you? You didn't take my calls, so I got a new phone. I'm at your place. We need to talk. I don't like what you're doing, Daniel. So let's talk about it. Here's what we'll do, go back home, and let me get some work done. Okay, but don't say I didn't try to talk to you. Hello. So, gorgeous, wouldn't you like the President to be your client? I'm not settling for that fat bitch when she's first lady. That won't be good for the country. It's all worked out. The party wants me to be our candidate. But not before I get rid of a certain thorn in my side. Watch it. He is my client too, baby. We never stop competing. But this time he's screwed, just like that jerk Santiago Marín, no matter what the polls say. I'll fix him, baby. I sure will. Right? You know how boring I find politics. Why don't we talk about us? When are you going to get you know what for me? Surprise! Why you deserve a double free session. No honey. You need to pay me in cash. Business is business. - I know. - And fun is fun. Lorena. What's the matter? I'm so cold. You have a very high fever. Please lend me your comforter. You don't need a comforter. That's the last thing you need. Take yours off. We have to get rid of your fever. That is so cold. Listen. What did you do to Bambi? How come she's mad at you? Is La Soledad alley very far? It depends. How far do you want to go? As far away as possible. Three hundred. This fat dumb bastard. Get up, idiot. The Madame will kick you out if she sees you. Please help me, miss. They've kidnapped me and other Russian women. Get off of me, Bobby. What are you doing? What's the problem? It's your period, right? Are we going biking this afternoon? I'm so fed up of that. Can't you think of anything else to do? What a tight ass. He's got the hots for you. I certainly don't for him. My boyfriend is 24 plus he is an attorney. He's drop-dead gorgeous and nice to me, and he takes me out to dinner. I feel like he knows me better than I do, although he is kind of weird. Sometimes he gets so serious all of a sudden. What's he like in bed? Tell me all about it. We haven't done it yet. It kind of freaks me out. What are you talking about, dummy? You have never been in bed with a guy? I thought you had screwed the entire school. Don't be silly. - At least Bobby? - Not even with him. You'd better hurry, before it chokes up in cobwebs. And it's a plus if you love the guy. What are you waiting for? The first sewing shift is now open. The first sewing shift is now open. When can I see Mrs. Lagos? It's urgent. She doesn't have time for a drama queen like you, Marta. So go sew something. Now! What's the matter? I said what's the matter. Are you deaf or what? I had to give that cop all my money. He's on to you. I'm talking to you. Stop fooling around. Nothing's the matter. It's no big deal. - How many do you have to sew? - 140. - My God. - Bambi. Lorena has something to say to you. Really? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. What? I said I'm sorry. And? And what? Come on, Bambi. Lorena swears she won't say a word about anything to anyone. Come on, accept her apology. I want to hear it from her, Magos. I said I'm sorry. If you really mean it, then get on your knees. No way. Come on, Bambi. You haven't seen the last of this, Magos. Stop it! Sorry. Sorry. You hit me because you still love me. I don't love faggots. Why didn't you tell me you're a guy? I was a guy, but now I'm a woman, whether you like it or not, even locked up in here. You goddamn faggot. You just won't stop this crap, will you? You're here because you still have feelings for me. Because I turn you on. Shut up, you lying little faggot. You're the liar. You even said you'd leave your wife for me. Shut up already. Although you're locked up in here, I'll get you for this. Mark my word. Remember all the things we did. All the things you said to me. - Shut up idiot. - All the... I said shut up. Stop it! - Get out of here. - Okay, okay, I'm going. Easy, boss. Just say the word and it's done. - Hello. - Mrs. Lagos. Hi. Come in. Be good, okay? Please have a seat. Thanks. I have a few questions regarding your wife Lorena's case, which is filled with irregularities. Have you spoken with Judge Cedeńo? That's one of the things we need to discuss. I can prove that he rushed the case, and withheld evidence which would've reduced her sentence considerably. And he apparently bribed two witnesses to support his first-degree murder charge. Go play with your brothers so I can speak with the lady. Mrs. Lagos, after all this time, I have forgotten some of the details, but what I do remember is... the rage in her eyes, while she slapped me. You must think all men are the same, that we just chase women so we can cheat on them. That we're a bunch of insensitive bastards. I met Lorena at college. She majored in chemistry. She was one of her generation's best students. Several generations, actually. I majored in architecture. I don't know what she saw in me, to be honest with you, she had it all. We started dating and got married soon after, but waited a few years to have kids. She was offered a job right away, even before she graduated, by one of the country's leading pharmaceutical companies. So we were doing pretty well by the time Julio was born. Even so, she decided to abandon her career to become a stay-at-home mom, and raise her kids, a full time mom actually. Then you got yourself a lover, Lorena caught you together, lost control in a fit of rage, and now she's in jail on account of a crooked trial. I assure you that I did everything I could for her. But all the lawyers I've talked to, refuse to confront Cedeńo. I know I am the main reason why Lorena is in prison, and I regret cheating on her every single moment. I wish I could change things, but I just can't. What would you have done in her place? Would you have killed me? Excuse me. Good afternoon Susy. - Hello Patrick. - Come in. Thanks. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - I have to go to work. Sorry. Thank you for seeing me. Susy, please make sure they eat their food. I'll see you out. Thanks. This is a very special evening. A group of industrialists is coming over, so I want you to look extra nice for them, and above all, be extra sweet to them. Where is Dobrina? Up in her room. He's here, ma'am. - Good afternoon. - Ma'am. This one's ready to go to work. Don't you think? - She sure is. - Great. Let's take a look at you. Freeze! Police! - Santiago. - This way. I'm placing you under arrest for procuring, forgery and bribery of a government official. Is that enough? Come with us please. This is a mistake. What's going on, Marta? So? Are you going to do your job? That crap you gave me was no good. You know what to do to get the real thing. I'll do it, Bambi, I just need a little help. Go ahead. Do it tonight, Marta. Or else. - Enjoy your meal. - Go to hell. Keep an eye on that bitch. - Hi. - Hi. - Mrs. Lagos. - Yes? I've asked to see you for days but they won't let me. - I'm sorry, ma'am. - Come into my office. Return to your cells. They won't let me see my woman, not even on a regular day. I don't get it. She's like my boyfriend, but a girl. Whether she's your girl or not has nothing to do with it. The issue here is that she is an ex-convict, so she can't enter a place like this, where we're so focused on rehabilitation. That's so unfair. That means I won't see Selma unless she commits a crime? That's not the way it works. Any reoffenders who were once in here, are automatically sent to other prisons. You get only one shot at Capadocia. When you leave, you go home to your family, to your daughters, who hug you and tell you how much they love you. I never had any of that, until I met Selma and you took her away from me. Okay Marta, here is the deal. I can help you if you help me. Dr. Burián says you are not in the rehabilitation program. I need you to be there, to act responsibly, and behave yourself. If you do that, I'll help you. You could be with Selma and everything. You'll let me see her? Yes and not just that. I will review your case, and recommend you to the rehabilitation program. If you cooperate, in less than a year, you'll be with your girlfriend, but not in here, out there. I got ten years. But you already did more than half your time. You are just perfect for that program. Excuse me. I'm leaving. Sergeant Juárez will be in charge. See you in three days. Isabel, I hope your dad gets well soon. Thank you. Think about it. What's the matter? Are you alright? Get me out of here, Burián. I didn't admit it, but you were right. I was interested in Lorena's case for personal reasons. I had a similar experience. We met at that convention in Guadalajara, remember? The day before, I saw Santiago in his office, having sex with another woman. I didn't see her face and never knew who it was. Until now. It was Isabel. I don't know why it's bothering me so much. She was one of his closest collaborators, and his lover for who knows how long. And on top of that, he put us to work together. How evil is that? The world is definitely made of dreams. Or fools. The night we met in Guadalajara, I thought we were attracted to one another. But you used me to get back at him. Now you want to get me in the sack again, to get back at him again? No José. I don't need to get back at anyone. Magos. Go with her. Bambi says hello. Let go of me. Bambi will be furious. She'll kill me for not finishing you off. Where are you going? I need to see Bambi. Who's there? No way. Come in. What now Marta? You just can't get it right, can you? Close the door. What can I do for you? I have something to tell you. Do you now? - Hold her face up. - Don't touch her, bitch. What did you give her? What did you give her, bitch? Hold her head. Stop it Consuelo. Put something in her mouth. Hold her head. What is it, Consuelo? Hold her. Consuelo. Is she alright? I think so. What did you want to tell me? You need to know how to blend drugs and I do. I'm worth more to you alive. Are you now? So you'll help me out for nothing? In exchange for coke. Wait. Not here in front of my house. I want you too, but let's go a little slower. Okay. This is for you. Bye. Teresa. Teresa. What are you doing here? Please don't yell at me. You've been crying, haven't you? How about a drink? I don't think that's such a good idea. Wallowing in it is an even worse idea. Doctor. Thank you. You look tired Doctor. Problems at work? A little. That's what you get for treating only women. Talking about women, that one hasn't taken her eyes off of you. Are you alright? Marta, there's someone to see you. Did you hear what I said? Move it. Marta Gómez has a visitor. I can't take it anymore, honey. I miss you too much. I tried to get in trouble, so they'd lock me up again. But I bumped into some jerk instead. Don't do that. Wait, baby. Don't do anything stupid. I want to be with you. Me too. But the director says you can't come back here. What then? Won't I ever see you again?
