 Yeah. Yeah, I speak English. Figure. You got a family? On the East Coast. Here. Husband? No, no. Probably not. But, um... I'm not... I'm not a dead weight out here. I know how to handle myself. I survived six weeks without him. If you can get me to the stadium, I can help 'cause I know people, people who can help. And, uh, I can pay. Hey, hey, alright. I'm... I'm not gonna dump you, OK? Thank you. You won't regret it. I promise.

 You gotta do the right thing, right? Be the... the good person? - Yeah. - I don't think any of that matters anymore, huh? Hey. Hey, you got a gun? No. No. Hmm... A gun? Hey. Look in the glove. Look out! Shit! Navigate. OK. I... I wish I had my glasses. We need to stay near the 118, huh? Yeah. Hmm... Take it about 10 miles 'til we hit the 112 and take it to downtown. I-I'm just trying to figure out where we... where we are. We just passed Bennington. - I wish I had my damn glasses. - WHAT'S THE MATTER? Look, I'm sorry. It-it-it's just... - What?! - In two "block." Two, two, two blocks? - Two? Two blocks. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Keep your eye on the road. - Left. Left. - Two blocks from what? Left? - Keep your eye on the road! Two blocks, turn left? You're sure? Alright. What? What? The truck? Have they been following us the whole time? What the fuck do you want? What? Gasu. Gasu. Gas? Do you think they want our gas? - Hai, hai, hai. - I think she's right. Motherfuckers! Should we help them? Hey. Only if you want to get shot. Run, run! Run! Run! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! - Go! Go! - Get away from me! - HELP! - Come on! Oh, fuck! Get off of me! Oh, shit! - Fuck! - Get off her! Get off her! Fuck! Let her go! Shit! Fuck! This road sucks. We gotta get off this road. No, no, no, no, no! No! I know this isn't the road, but I'm trying to find another one. No, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Look, this road is shit! No! No, no, look. Look. Give me that. Give me the map. No. This road, I know this area, OK? Let the man drive, OK? I know my way around here. I used to work around here. What the fuck was what?! OH, MY GOD! Son of a bitch! What the fuck?! - Where are they coming from?! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Watch out! - Ah! Oh, God! - Look out! - Heads up! Go! Oh, my gosh! Motherfuckers! Faster! - Faster! - I'm trying! I'm trying! We're good! We're good! - No, we're not good! - We're good! - No. - We're good. We're good! We're good, OK? We're good. Everybody good? We're good, OK? Goddamn! I'm dragging something. Shit! What? - Uh, brake, brake, brake. - You want me to stop? You want me to pull over? You sure that's a good idea? I don't think we should stop. OK, OK, OK. I'm gonna stop, alright? I'm gonna pull over. This is too dangerous. This looks clear. I won't leave you. I promise. We'll be here. I said I won't. Now, hurry up. It's OK. Be careful. It's back there. Check back there. GET IN THE CAR! Get back in! Let's go! Get around! Let's go! - Son of a bitch! - No! You motherfucker! Get off my car! Hang on! Hang on! Aaah! Go! He's not pulling off. Not pulling off. He's still there. - He's still there! - You get off my car, you motherfucker! OK, be cool. I think we lost him. We're good. We're good? You guys good? - You're good? - I don't see him. You're good. Hang on! Die, you motherfucker! Get rid of him! Just hang on! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Let go, you crazy bully! You guys, don't... Fuck it! No, you motherfucker! Let me go! Let me go! Get my hammer! Grab my hammer! In the bag! Grab my hammer! Hit him in the head! Hit him in the face! Hit this motherfucker! Let him go! AH! GET OFF, YOU MOTHERFUCKER! Fuck you! Alright. Maybe that road sucks after all. Hell, uh... ...next time, I'll listen. Thanks. You know, that was the first one I ever seen so close. Shit! Those fuckers are worse than I heard, huh? I remember the first one I saw. It was behind a fence, so we... It couldn't catch me, but it just... ...it just kept coming after me. Banging against the fence, like a rabid dog. And I... I remember thinking... ..."This used to be somebody. And now just look at him." He just... You know, he seemed so... so trapped. I couldn't even tell if... there was a real person still in there somewhere. You know what I think? I think we're all being punished. For everything. For all the bad shit. - What? - I think you missed her turn. Where? Back there? Shit! And where is that? OK. Left on that one? It's that truck again. Motherfucker! What do we do now? Nothing. - Give me that hammer. - You're going out there? No, no, no, no, no. I don't think that's a good idea. Alright. You know, I heard it was worse on the roads than on foot. I'm beginning to understand why. I'm not scared of you, little bitch. You won't win no gas. Let's see what you got, motherfucker. Hang on back there. He's still there. He's still there. Goddammit! Right? Right here? - Hai, hai, hai. - Right turn here? Yeah, yeah, you go! Go! Go! Go! Hang on, lady. - I think you lost them. - Alright, alright. Alright, relax. Let's go. - Jesus! - Please, we need your help! - Let us in! - Take us to the next checkpoint They're after us, man, let us in! Shut the fuck up! - We got food, water! - Let us in! I'll suck your dick! Whatever you want! - Just let us in! - Open up! You good? Yeah. Yeah. You OK? You good? Yeah. You got a picture in there? "A picture"? Your mom? She looks like you. Is she alive? You're looking for her? You'll find her. Hmm? We'll go to the stadium, and you'll find her. Mm-hmm? You wanna hear something crazy? A few months ago... ...I was working on those poles right up there. Man! Shit changes, huh? William. William Velez. Ooh Kyungsun. - Ooh... - Kyungsun. - Kyungsun? - Kyungsun. Mm-hmm. Kyungsun. - Ooh... - Kyung... - Kyung. - Call me Sun. - Sun? Sun? - Call me Sun.

But here we are, huh? Here we are. "Here we are." How much? How many bullets do you have? About one and a half clips. How many is that? Not enough. We need weapons, ammo. A fucking car would be nice. OK. Is there someone from your unit that we can call? Contact? No. What do you mean, no? You saw it back there. What about the army? The-the National Guard? The CDC? There's nobody. Like the man said, we're on our own. Hey. Ain't that the car we saw earlier? Yeah, it's the same car... but it's a different driver. Oh, my God! That's her.
