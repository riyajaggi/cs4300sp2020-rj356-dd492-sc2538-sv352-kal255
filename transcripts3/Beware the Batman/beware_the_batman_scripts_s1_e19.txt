 Download of Sirenox encryption code complete. The key can open any door. Too bad you didn't close them behind you. You never know what you'll let in. Too late, Bats. With this code, I can open any computer on earth. End of the line. Drop your weapons, and put your hands on your heads. What are they gonna do? Lock me up? Hands on your heads, now! You have your man, Dent. Quit while you're ahead.

 I'll quit when you're behind bars, Batman. - Don't forget the tires. - On it. How can you be sure he won't escape? The shells on his hands are military-grade prisoner-restraint tech from Stagg Industries. No hands means no escape. If you say so. By the way, which one of these cells is the smallest? I'm not sure. Why? I want that one reserved for Batman. Putting the Key in Blackgate is a mistake. Sirenox encryption safeguards the most sensitive information in the world. Military, government, business, and the Key has the access code. What do you want me to do?

 Dent has free reign with that Special Crimes Unit of his, and they made a clean bust. Besides, Blackgate is a maximum security prison. What's more secure than that? Federal Supermax isolation. He's not a global threat. Not yet. He'll get over it. Probably. Not hungry? I'm going to bed. Bed? Now? Are you sick? Do you even get sick? No. I'm fine. Just tired. Good night. All right! Party time! Or bedtime... I'm confused. Does he just look like a penguin, or is he an actual penguin? You win, Dent. Arrest me. Get on the floor! No need. I'm turning myself in voluntarily. Down! Now! Good day for you. Good day? Great day! Best day I've had in years. Shall we? The unmasking of Batman. We should have the press here. Any last words, before we find out who you really are, Batman? Turn it off! Turn it off! Fine. Let him keep his Halloween costume. In here, that suit's a bull's-eye. Get used to this cell, because I'm gonna make sure you never leave it. We don't poke the bears in here, Mr. Dent. We got the Key, boss. But get this. Batman's in the cooler. The Batman. What should we do? That's easy, boys. Take the prison. Sir, this may be nothing... If it was nothing, you wouldn't be here, Detective Brown. Right. We're trying to reach Blackgate to schedule prisoner transpos, and no one's picking up. Call the warden's office. We did. No answer there, either. You think this has something to do with Dent arresting Batman? Dent arrested Batman? Lookin' for someone, baby? Huh? Where's the Key? Is that any way to greet an old friend? You don't got a lot of those in here. We're not friends. Where? Okay, easy now. You want the Key? You gotta go see the king. Hardest case in the gate. Came in small-time, clawed his way up one beef at a time. Skin like leather, mouth full of fangs. I thought you were the king. I am the king, baby... On the outside. In here, I'm just a V.I.P. Police are still maintaining a media blackout, so no word yet on Batman's reported arrest, or the nature of his involvement in this escalating crisis. How long was I asleep? No demands. No word on the warden or guards. We have no idea what's going on in there. We have to get eyes inside. Where's the surveillance feed? We've tapped in, but there's nothing to see. - They cut the cables. - Perfect. You didn't think I'd want to know you arrested Batman? I didn't care. Right. And how'd that work out? How do we get him out? Blackgate is a fortress by design, and we're completely blind inside. I'll do what I can out here. And I'll do what Batman would do. I was hoping you'd say... Hi, it's me. I need some help. You busy? Busy? Are you kidding? Batman's in trouble. I've been waiting for your call. Whatever you need, I'm on it. I'm looking at the Blackgate schematic you sent, but I'm not seeing the sublevel access hatch. Are you sure about this? That's the closest to a utility access tunnel. Do you have a flashlight? I have everything. Yeah, hey now, come on, guys. Isn't there a better way to get these cuffs off? Easy. Easy. Batman! You gotta help me. Please! Say goodbye. We're leaving. You ain't in charge here, Batman. I am. You're the king? Don't much like formalities. Call me Killer Croc. Got that name on account of my good looks. It fits. Kind of you to say so. When I heard you were paying us a visit, I took the liberty of giving our jailers a powder. Only way to make sure you wouldn't steal away with my new toy before I got a chance to play with it. The Key isn't your toy. On the contrary. The Key's my property now. So's the computer skeleton key stashed in those fancy fingers of his. Wrong. I'm walking him out of here one way or another. Things work a little different in here than they do out there, Batman. You want something in here, you gotta take it. And taking it? That's the tricky part. For me? Or for you? So I'm gonna give you the opportunity to win my property, fair and square. I'm not here to play games. Oh, it ain't a game. It's a fight. Winner takes all. Wait for the tear gas. Neutralize hostiles first. No lethal force. No casualties. I repeat, no casualties. That will be easy, since we're not going in. Animals police themselves in the jungle. Why fight nature? Hennelly, take over. You think you can get rid of Batman like this? The thought never crossed my mind. This isn't your call. I know. It's the mayor's call. But, as you know, Mayor Grange is on leave. Hard to blame her. That Humpty Dumpty ordeal must have been traumatic. So, Deputy Mayor Hall is in charge. Just got off the phone with him, and you know what he said? "Do what you think is best, Harvey." So I am. Stand down, Gordon. Are you sure I didn't overshoot it? Seems like I've gone too far. Positive. It's just a little further. Unless the schematic is outdated. - Wait, what? - Nothing. Keep going. Save your gasoline, Batman. Race ain't even started yet, and it's gonna be a barnburner. Allow me to introduce Matatoa. Bona fide Maori warrior. We even liberated his tribal weapons from the property locker, special, for the occasion. You boys play nice, now. Watch your back, baby. That Matatoa cat thinks he's immortal. Something about stealing his foes' life force by eating his heart. Dude ain't right. Thanks for the tip. The schematic doesn't say anything about the hatch being sealed. I'll find another way in. You can't open that hatch without a blowtorch. No problem. The belt has one. Goggles, too. This belt's pretty handy. Maybe I should get one for myself. Can I have one, too? What are you doing? I'm going to make a statement to the press. - What are you gonna say? - Not much. Just that we're sitting on our hands out here because of you. You wouldn't dare! No? Watch me on the news. Okay. Okay. What do you want? I want to end this. Now. Warm-up's over, Croc. Face me. Thought you'd never ask. I was wrong about you, Batman. Didn't think you'd have the stomach for all this. I'm going to enjoy hurting you. See there? You're fitting in just fine. My turn. Bat is mighty tasty. Who knew? Batman! You shouldn't be here. You shouldn't see this. It's over. We're going home. Cooperate, or you're next. Yeah, sure. Cooperate. Who's first? We gotta go! Blackgate's under control. The warden and the guards are safe, and we're reprocessing prisoners now. We'll keep the Key in custody at the precinct, but he won't be a problem anytime soon. I think you scared him straight in there. You need a hospital. No. No hospital. It's okay. I know what he needs. Home sweet home. Hello, old friend. It appears you've missed me.
