 Previously on Beware the Batman. So this is goodbye? Duty calls. You coming? Again. No. I'm starving. Aren't you hungry? No. Well, I'm not like you. I need food to stay alive.

 You know Alfred would never let you push yourself like this. Alfred isn't here. Anything else before my night of rubber chicken and rubber stamps at the Chamber of Commerce, Karen? Yes, a funding request from the D.A.'s office. It's for the proposed Special Crimes Unit. A unit tasked with confronting Gotham City's mask and cape crisis. As they put it. Harvey Dent. Gotham City's very own anti-caped crusader. Six months ago, he used the blackout to get himself elected district attorney, and he's been milking it ever since. I'll get to this tomorrow. Or never.

 Move! Commissioner Correa goes down during the blackout. You save the day and replace him just in time for this. You're kicking off your tenure as commissioner with a bang, Jim. Not by choice, mayor. We've set up a 10-block perimeter. We're knockin' on doors, stopping all vehicles. We're sweeping the building again and moving... Bomb squad just finished their second sweep. They say the building's clean. Tell 'em to sweep again. Third time's a charm, boys. Mayor, please. For your safety, let us take you to a secure location. I'm not leaving, Jim. Not until I have some answers. Mayor Grange. I came as soon as I heard. You're not hurt. No, Mr. Dent. It appears I've dodged yet another bullet. That's fortunate. Commissioner, I saw the bat signal in the sky. Please, tell me Batman isn't here. Do you see him here? No. But I just want to be clear that, legally, the city doesn't condone costumed vigilantes. And, personally, I object to Batman's existence. You've made yourself abundantly clear, Mr. Dent, legally and personally. So you're not colluding with a known felon and suspect then? Batman isn't a suspect. Matter of time. On second thought, I will call it a night. Mr. Dent, why don't you walk me out? Commissioner, keep me posted. Did you get all that? Harvey Dent doesn't like me. Maybe he just doesn't know you. You should grab a smoothie with him sometime. How fast can you analyze the blast signature? Nano-thermite reaction. Interesting. Any idea where it came from? Yes. One of my batarangs. Did you have something to do with this bombing? Do you think I had something to do with it? No. I... I don't know. Lately, you've been more dark and broody than usual. This is circumstantial evidence. It doesn't prove Batman is the bomber. Not on its own, but it's enough for an arrest and a search warrant. Then we'll finally see who's behind that mask. I'll bring him in for questioning. But don't get your hopes up on the mask. You can't protect Batman forever. Batman doesn't need my protection, Mr. Dent. But keep hounding him, and you might. Is that a threat? No. Just the truth. Hm. So you know. All I know is the forensics test implicate you in the bombing. What am I missing? I'm being framed. By who? Any ideas? Ideas, but nothing concrete. You think I know something he doesn't. I need something solid. And I need it before Dent makes a move. Batman, you're under arrest. Stand down. Stand down! Dent, why are these officers here? I requisitioned them. On whose authority? Mine. Read the city charter, commissioner. You're out of line, Dent. I'm handling this. How? By aiding an outlaw vigilante? It's over, Gordon. Officers, take the suspects into custody. You two, hands on your head. Hands. Now! Try not to hurt them. I'll do my best. Sorry. You still haven't told me what we're doing here. Someone is trying to make me look like a criminal. So I'm gonna give them what they want. Dent. Why are we... Are you insane? Not now. Chief, you need to see this. This better not be another one of your blooper videos, O'Brien. Tell Hennelly to mobilize all available S.W.A.T. personnel. The target is Batman. You. You're fine, Mr. Dent. It'll take a little more time for the tranquilizer to wear off completely. I can't wait to personally escort you to Blackgate Penitentiary. The animals in there are going to eat you alive. I've changed my mind. This jerk deserves to be kidnapped. Mr. Dent, I apologize for bringing you here against your will. But I had to do something drastic and unexpected to lure the party attempting to frame me into the open. It's a gamble, but the upside is you'll soon know who the real bomber is. I already know who the real bomber is. I'm looking at him. Oh, Mr. Dent. You're faithful to your demons, but even you don't believe that. What am I going to do with you, Batman? I go to such lengths to compose the perfect script for your ruination. And you don't even have the decency to play your part. You bombed the mayor's office? Of course I did. And now, we have to improvise a new ending. Luckily, I love to improvise. Ahhh! One for me. And one for each of you. They're proximity charges. If the bands are separated by too great a distance, they'll explode. We're linked now like flowers and bees, but I want to bring us closer together by showing Batman the true outlaw his soul yearns to be. That's the Symbion Business Park. Good eye, Mr. Dent. Batman is going to escort you there and surrender to the authorities for all to see. If he doesn't, I'll detonate another bigger bomb. Batman's band is paired with Dent's. And yours is paired with mine. Tick tock, gentlemen. Do you think I'm buying this puppet show? I think you're stubbornly denying reality. This isn't reality. It's theater. Right down to the ridiculous costumes. The sooner you open your eyes, the better it will be for Gotham and you. Okay, Batman. If this is real, if we're really in danger, why don't you have a plan to get us out of it? Who says I don't? Batman is driving rather slowly for someone with such a fast car. The Batmobile is not as fast as it looks. Those rockets, just for show. Or, he's stalling for time to crack my code. A pity, it won't do him any good. Katana, such a rare diamond, so much untapped potential. You shouldn't allow Batman to stifle your growth. At least Batman doesn't need a bomb to keep me around. Can you feel that? Chemistry. Pull over! Now! Are you okay, Mr. Dent? I'm fine. Copy that. We have a visual on the Batmobile. Get ready to intercept. So what happens after Batman is arrested? Is that it? That's your big finish? Pretty lame if you ask me. Oh, the law is a bludgeon. Too clumsy for this gambit. Batman won't be arrested. They're walking into a trap. Batman will figure that out or, well, Gotham will need a new D.A. And you'll need a new partner. Temper, temper. You don't wanna lose your head and everything else. You're bluffing. Am I? Let's find out. You are a pistol, aren't you? You have no idea. Rental, I assume? Hope it's faster than it looks and that these explodey cuffs have some range. For both our sakes. Oh, goodie. What's wrong? You forget the code? I don't forget codes. I haven't cracked this one yet, but I will. Until then, we're following Anarky's instructions because I believe the bomb is here. Wait. So you walked us into a blast zone. On purpose. Yes, someone has to disable the bomb. Right. The bomb squad. Anarky won't let that happen. How do you know all this? I'm Batman. We're linked now like flowers and bees. Flowers and bees. That's it. What? You broke the code? Maybe. There's just one problem. Batman. Raise your hands and step away from Dent. Slowly. If I do that, we'll both explode. Tell them. Take him down! Call them off, Gordon. This isn't what you think it is. I don't know what I think. Surrender and we'll all figure this out together. If I surrender, we'll all die together. Your band. Don't worry, I'm not alone. A clever bet, Katana. But this hand is mine. Those look better on you. Hmm, you cracked the code, Batman. Tell me, how did you do it? You believe we have a symbiotic link. Like bees and flowers. That's why we're in Symbion Park. Bats are linked to flowers too, and a key part of that link is nectar: The password. Bravo. I told you we were linked. Yes, but our link isn't symbiotic. It's parasitic. I know the bomb is here, Anarky. You can't detonate it without adding yourself to the body count. I beg to differ. Run! Anarky's gone. Who cares? Arrest Batman. And his girlfriend. Katana. One name is not that hard to remember. Batman just saved your life. That doesn't change anything. It does for me. We're done here. Batman, Katana, have a good night. That stunt you pulled could have gone either way. You've been taking bigger and bigger risks since Alfred left. I'm worried. I'm fine. And I'm not your concern. I'm approving funds for Dent's Special Crimes Unit. You can't be serious. After this situation, I have to give Dent enough rope to hang himself now. Or he'll win my job in the next election and that would be worse. Much worse. Hi, major. It's Tatsu. I don't know when you'll hear this message, but wherever you are, it's time for you to come back. Batman needs you. Bruce needs you. I need you. Please. Come home.
