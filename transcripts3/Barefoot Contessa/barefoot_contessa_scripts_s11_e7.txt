 ONE OF MY FAVORITE TIMES  TO ENTERTAIN IS BREAKFAST. ALL YOU NEED IS A PLAN,  SIMPLE MENU--YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. MY FRIEND STEPHEN  IS COMING OVER, AND I'M GONNA SHOW HIM  HOW EASY IT REALLY IS. FIRST, I'M MAKING  BUTTERMILK CHEDDAR BISCUITS THAT I CAN MAKE  THE NIGHT BEFORE AND POP INTO THE OVEN  FOR BREAKFAST. THEN HOMEMADE STRAWBERRY JAM THAT TAKES JUST 30 MINUTES  TO MAKE AND A CITRUSY BREAKFAST COCKTAIL  CALLED JUICE OF A FEW FLOWERS WITH THE MOST DELICIOUS  HERBED SCRAMBLED EGGS.

 SO IT'S BACK TO BASICS,  BAREFOOT STYLE, AND I'M MAKING BREAKFAST. Closed Captions provided by  Scripps Networks, LLC. Captioned by Closed Captioning Services, Inc. I LOVE GIVING A PARTY  FOR BREAKFAST, BUT WHO WANTS TO GET UP AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING AND BAKE? NOT ME. WHAT I LEARNED  WHEN I RAN BAREFOOT CONTESSA IS I CAN MAKE BISCUITS  THE NIGHT BEFORE AND PUT THEM IN THE OVEN  IN THE MORNING, AND THEY'RE FANTASTIC. SO I'M GONNA MAKE  CHEDDAR BUTTERMILK BISCUITS. THE KEY TO MAKING GOOD BISCUITS  IS REALLY COLD INGREDIENTS-- BUTTER, EGGS, MILK.

 SO I NEED  1 1/2 STICKS OF BUTTER. IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT  TO HAVE REALLY COLD INGREDIENTS WHEN YOU'RE MAKING BISCUITS, BECAUSE WHEN THE HEAT  OF THE OVEN HITS THE BISCUITS, IT HITS THE BUTTER, AND THE STEAM CAUSES THEM TO PUFF UP SO THEY'RE  REALLY LIGHT AND FLAKY. SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY EVEN  ALSO FREEZE THE FLOUR, BUT I THINK  THAT'S A LITTLE EXTREME. OKAY, THE DRY INGREDIENTS-- 2 CUPS OF FLOUR. YOU JUST WANT TO LIGHTEN  THE FLOUR WITH YOUR CUP. IT'S REALLY NOT NECESSARY  TO SIFT IT. ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. THAT'S ONE, TWO. AND BECAUSE I WANT REALLY LIGHT AND FLAKY BISCUITS, A TABLESPOON OF BAKING POWDER. SEEMS LIKE A LOT,  BUT IT'S REALLY WORTH IT. 1 1/2 TEASPOONS OF SALT  SO THEY HAVE LOTS OF FLAVOR. OKAY, NEXT FOR THE BUTTER.  IT'S UNSALTED BUTTER. PUT IT IN WITH THE FLOUR AND JUST MIX IT UNTIL  IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF PEAS. OKAY, NOW BUTTERMILK AND EGG. BUTTERMILK'S ACTUALLY GREAT.  IT KEEPS BAKING REALLY MOIST, AND IT'S LOW-FAT, TOO,  WHICH IS PRETTY HARD TO ARGUE WHEN YOU JUST PUT 12 TABLESPOONS  OF BUTTER IN SOMETHING, BUT WHAT THE HECK? SO I NEED 1/2 A CUP  OF BUTTERMILK, ONE EGG, AND BOTH OF THESE  ARE REALLY COLD, SO IT'LL KEEP  THE BUTTER COLD. I'M JUST GONNA  WHISK THEM TOGETHER. OKAY, CAN'T MAKE  CHEDDAR BUTTERMILK BISCUITS WITHOUT GOOD CHEDDAR. I ACTUALLY LOVE LIKE VERMONT  CHEDDAR OR ENGLISH CHEDDAR, SOMETHING REALLY SHARP THAT'S GOT--  YOU REALLY KNOW IT'S CHEDDAR. SO I NEED ABOUT A CUP. I'M JUST GONNA GRATE IT  ON A BIG BOX GRATER. YOU CAN DO THIS  IN A FOOD PROCESSOR, BUT WHY GET  THE FOOD PROCESSOR ALL DIRTY? I KNOW STEPHEN LOVES  CHEDDAR BISCUITS, SO I THINK  IT'LL BE PERFECT FOR HIM. SO THE GOAL IS REALLY LIGHT,  FLAKY BISCUITS WITH LOTS OF FLAVOR,  AND THE BUTTERMILK IS GONNA GIVE IT  A LITTLE BIT OF A TANGY FLAVOR, AND THE CHEDDAR'S GONNA  JUST GIVE IT SO MUCH FLAVOR. OKAY, THAT SHOULD BE JUST ABOUT  A CUP OF GOOD CHEDDAR. AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS I'M GONNA MIX IT WITH A LITTLE FLOUR SO IT DOESN'T CLUMP  IN THE BISCUITS-- JUST A TABLESPOON OR SO-- AND THEN  1 CUP OF GRATED CHEDDAR. AND JUST MIX IT  ALL TOGETHER. OKAY, SO NOW I'M READY  TO PUT IT ALL INTO THE MIXTURE. SO YOU WANT THE BUTTER  THE SIZE OF PEAS IN THE FLOUR, AND IT'S PERFECT RIGHT NOW, SO I'M JUST GONNA  PUT IN THE WET INGREDIENTS. SO COLD BUTTERMILK  AND COLD EGG, JUST POUR IT IN  PRETTY QUICKLY... AND THE CHEDDAR MIXED WITH A LITTLE BIT  OF FLOUR. OKAY, THAT'S IT.  IT'S REALLY FAST. I'M GONNA CLEAR THE DECKS,  ROLL IT OUT. USUALLY I USE  A COOKIE CUTTER FOR THIS, FOR BISCUITS--SOME ROUND ONE, MAYBE SOMETIMES  WITH A FLUTED EDGE-- AND THEN ONE DAY  I COULDN'T FIND IT. AND I THOUGHT  OH, MY GOD, WHAT AM I GONNA DO? AND I REALIZED I COULD JUST DO IT WITH A KNIFE. AND IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER,  AND IT LOOKS VERY ROUGH AND HOMEMADE-LOOKING.  I LOVE IT. SO A LITTLE FLOUR  FOR THE DECK TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T STICK. AND THE DOUGH--  JUST DUMP IT RIGHT OUT. I'M JUST GONNA GIVE IT  A QUICK KNEAD, NOT SO MUCH THAT YOU MELT  THE BUTTER IN THE DOUGH. USE LOTS OF FLOUR SO THAT  THEY DON'T STICK TO THE DECK. NO POINT IN MAKING BISCUITS IF YOU CAN'T GET THEM  OFF THE COUNTERTOP. OKAY, JUST KEEP FLOURING IT, MAKING SURE IT MOVES AROUND  ON THE DECK. SO I'M GONNA DO  A RECTANGLE, MAYBE ABOUT  10 INCHES BY 5 INCHES, AND I'LL GET EIGHT  BUTTERMILK BISCUITS OUT OF IT. SO ABOUT 3/4 OF AN INCH THICK, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN  1/2 AND 3/4 OF AN INCH THICK. DO IT IN A NICE RECTANGLE,  LIKE THAT. OKAY, BIG KNIFE. AND SOMETIMES YOU EVEN  FLOUR THE KNIFE TO MAKE SURE  THEY DON'T STICK. CUT IT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. THIS IS THE PART WHERE  I COULDN'T FIND THE CUTTER, AND I THOUGHT, WELL, I'M JUST  GONNA CUT THEM UP, AND THEY CAME OUT REALLY ROUGH  AND VERY HOMEMADE-LOOKING. I LOVE THEM.  JUST LIKE THAT. OKAY, ONTO A SHEET PAN. MY FRIEND STEPHEN'S REALLY BUSY,  AND HE LOVES TO ENTERTAIN, AND TOMORROW I'M GONNA SHOW HIM  HOW EASY IT IS TO GIVE A BREAKFAST PARTY. SO THESE ARE GONNA GO  INTO THE REFRIGERATOR, AND THEN TOMORROW I'M GONNA  BRUSH THEM WITH EGG WASH AND SPRINKLE THEM WITH CHEDDAR, AND THEY'RE GONNA BE SO GOOD  WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE OVEN. THERE'S SOMETHING SO SPECIAL ABOUT HOMEMADE STRAWBERRY JAM  FOR BREAKFAST. IT JUST MAKES IT FEEL  LIKE A PARTY. AND IT'S SO EASY, YOU CAN MAKE IT  THE NIGHT BEFORE. WELL, ACTUALLY YOU CAN MAKE IT  A MONTH BEFORE. AND JUST TAKE  FRESH STRAWBERRIES. I'VE GOT 2 PINTS, HULLED. AND I'VE REALLY  JUST CHOPPED THEM IN HALF. I LIKE WHEN THERE ARE WHOLE PIECES OF STRAWBERRIES  IN THE JAM. SO 3 PINTS OF STRAWBERRIES  RIGHT INTO THE POT. I CUT THE BIG ONES IN QUARTERS  AND THE SMALL ONES IN HALVES. I LOVE TO SEE BIG PIECES OF STRAWBERRY IN JAM. AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA  ADD A FEW THINGS THAT ARE GONNA BRING OUT THE REAL ESSENCE  OF THE STRAWBERRY-- 3 CUPS OF SUPERFINE SUGAR. THIS IS THE KIND  THAT YOU USE FOR DRINKS. IT MELTS REALLY QUICKLY. IF YOU CAN'T FIND  SUPERFINE SUGAR, YOU CAN TAKE REGULAR SUGAR,  PUT IT IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR AND BLEND IT,  AND IT BECOMES SUPER FINE. OR SOMETIMES YOU CAN FIND  CASTOR SUGAR, WHICH IS THE ENGLISH VERSION. AND THEN TO GIVE IT  EVEN MORE FLAVOR, SORT OF TO BRING  OUT THAT STRAWBERRY-NESS, IS ORANGE FLAVORED LIQUEUR.  I'M GONNA PUT IN 2 TABLESPOONS. MMM, LOVE THE WAY  THAT SMELLS. OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA BRING  THAT UP TO A SIMMER, LET THAT BOIL AWAY, AND IN THE MEANTIME, I'M GONNA CHOP UP A GREEN APPLE. IT'S GONNA THICKEN THE JAM. GREEN APPLE HAS  LOTS OF PECTIN IN IT. IT'S ACTUALLY AVAILABLE  IN UNDERRIPE FRUIT, AND SINCE THE STRAWBERRIES  ARE SO RIPE, IT DOESN'T HAVE  A LOT OF PECTIN. WHAT'S AMAZING IS IT JUST SORT OF MELTS INTO THE JAM, AND YOU DON'T KNOW  IT'S THERE. SO I'M GONNA JUST  CHOP IT UP. I'M ONLY GONNA USE HALF. THE OTHER HALF'S A SNACK. IF I WANT TO DO THESE  SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE, I COULD PUT THEM  IN A CANNING JAR, BUT SINCE  I'M SERVING IT TOMORROW, I'M JUST GONNA  PUT IT IN A BOWL. OKAY, THAT'S HALF A GREEN APPLE. AND HERE'S  THE SURPRISE INGREDIENT-- 1/2 A CUP OF BLUEBERRIES. IT GIVES THE STRAWBERRY JAM  DEPTH OF FLAVOR AND COLOR. GIVE IT A BIG STIR. OH, IT SMELLS WONDERFUL. REALLY FRESH STRAWBERRIES,  THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA TASTE. SO THIS IS GONNA SIMMER AWAY  UNTIL IT GETS TO BE ABOUT 220 DEGREES  ON A CANDY THERMOMETER. IT SHOULD TAKE  ABOUT 25 OR 35 MINUTES. I'M JUST GONNA  KEEP AN EYE ON IT, LOOK AT IT  ONCE IN A WHILE, AND IF ANY OF THE FOAM COMES UP,  I'LL JUST SKIM IT RIGHT OFF. THIS IS GONNA BE  REALLY GOOD STRAWBERRY JAM. THAT'S NOT TOO HARD. GETTING READY FOR A PARTY IS NOT  ALWAYS JUST ABOUT THE FOOD. HERE ARE FIVE MORE THINGS I LIKE TO DO  TO GET READY IN ADVANCE. I GET THE COFFEE MACHINE  READY, FILL IT WITH WATER AND A ROUNDED TABLESPOON  OF COFFEE FOR EVERY 2 CUPS. SO IN THE MORNING, ALL I HAVE TO DO  IS TURN ON THE SWITCH. I PUT BUTTER  IN LITTLE RAMEKINS, AND LEAVE IT  OUT OF THE FRIDGE SO IT'S ROOM TEMPERATURE WHEN WE'RE READY FOR BREAKFAST. THEN I SET THE TABLE. I ALWAYS KEEP THE COLOR  UPBEAT FOR BREAKFAST, SO BLUE-AND-WHITE-STRIPED CLOTH  IS PERFECT, PLAIN WHITE NAPKINS,  WHITE PLATES. THEN SIMPLE FLOWERS.  I PICK ONE PALETTE, LIKE LIME GREEN AND WHITE, AND DO LOTS OF DIFFERENT  FLOWERS IN THE SAME COLOR. AND THEY JUST GO ON THE TABLE,  AND THE TABLE'S READY. OKAY, BACK TO THE JAM. AND THE KEY HERE  IS TO USE A CANDY THERMOMETER. I'M JUST GONNA CHECK  AND MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY 220. BUBBLING AWAY, IT'S BEGINNING  TO LOOK LIKE STRAWBERRY JAM. PERFECT. THAT WAS PRETTY EASY,  WASN'T IT? OKAY, NOW I'VE GOT THE JAM DONE,  BUTTERMILK CHEDDAR BISCUITS. I'M GONNA GO TO SLEEP. I'M GONNA REST REALLY EASY.  IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF. THE ONE THING I LEARNED AFTER CATERING PARTIES  FOR 20 YEARS IS MY FRIENDS  WON'T HAVE MORE FUN IF I MAKE EVERYTHING MYSELF, SO FOR A BREAKFAST PARTY,  I HIT THE BAKERY. I LOVE MAKIN'  A BIG BREAD BASKET WHERE EVERYBODY  HELPS THEMSELVES, BUT IT'S SO EASY FOR IT  TO LOOK LIKE A DOG'S BREAKFAST, EVERYTHING JUST PILED  IN TOGETHER. SO I USUALLY CHOOSE THINGS  THAT LOOK DIFFERENT, THAT HAVE DIFFERENT  FLAVORS AND TEXTURES-- SLICES OF BREAD, SMALL ROLLS,  SOMETHING SWEET. BUT I THINK  FOR THIS BREAKFAST-- LET'S SEE,  I'VE GOT THE CHEDDAR BISCUITS. THEY'LL BE GREAT  WITH THE SCRAMBLED EGGS. NOW I NEED SOMETHING  FOR STRAWBERRY JAM. CROISSANT, THAT'S PERFECT. CAN I HAVE  SIX CROISSANTS, PLEASE? I MEAN, REALLY, WHAT WOULDN'T GO  WITH HOMEMADE STRAWBERRY JAM? MY FRIEND STEPHEN'S COMING OVER, AND I'M GOING TO SHOW HIM  WHY BREAKFAST IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE  TIME OF THE DAY TO ENTERTAIN. IN FACT, IT'S SO EASY, I BET HE'LL BE DOING IT HIMSELF. I'M GONNA SHOW STEPHEN THAT  EVEN SOMEBODY AS BUSY AS HE IS CAN MAKE A BREAKFAST PARTY. ARE YOU BUSY  MAKING CHEDDAR CHEESE? I AM SO BUSY. ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS  WHAT I'VE DONE. I MADE REALLY EASY  STRAWBERRY JAM. EVEN YOU CAN MAKE IT. EVEN ME? EVEN YOU. I MADE COFFEE,  I SET THE TABLE, I MADE YOUR FAVORITE  BUTTERMILK CHEDDAR BISCUITS. AHH. YOU'RE GONNA  REALLY LIKE THEM. SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO  IS WE'RE GONNA GLAZE THEM, PUT A LITTLE  EGG WASH ON. OKAY. HOW'S THAT? TELL ME ABOUT AN EGG WASH. EGG WASH IS JUST AN EGG AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER OR MILK... MM-HMM. JUST WHIP IT UP.  AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES A NICE BROWN GLAZE  TO THE BISCUITS. THAT LOOKS EASY.  YOU KNOW, LIKE YOUR MOTHER  USED TO MAKE? DID YOUR MOTHER  USED TO MAKE BISCUITS? MY MOTHER DID NOT MAKE BISCUITS. SO I'M JUST GONNA BRUSH THESE  WITH THE EGG WASH. AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA PUT  CHEDDAR CHEESE ON THE TOP. ARE YOU READY FOR A LITTLE SPRINKLING?  GO FOR IT. OKAY. CAN THERE BE  TOO MUCH HERE?  NEVER TOO MUCH CHEDDAR. CAN I HELP YOU? YEAH. OKAY, RIGHT ON TOP. PERFECT. OOPS, THAT MIGHT BE  TOO MUCH CHEDDAR. AND HOW ABOUT  A SPRINKLING OF SALT? JUST GIVES A REALLY NICE  FLAVOR TO IT AND LOOKS GREAT  WHEN IT'S BAKED. OKAY, INTO THE OVEN, 425 DEGREES  FOR 25 TO 30 MINUTES, UNTIL THEY'RE PUFFED AND BROWNED  AND JUST DELICIOUS. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE  A BREAKFAST COCKTAIL. A BREAKFAST BUZZ,  I LOVE IT. SO IT'S NOT A PARTY WITHOUT A COCKTAIL, RIGHT?  NOT A PARTY. EVEN IF IT'S BREAKFAST. WE NEED LOTS OF FRESH JUICE. I NEED TWO ORANGES.  START WITH THE ORANGES? YEP, TWO ORANGES. I'M GONNA SQUEEZE THEM. SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE IS JUICE OF A FEW FLOWERS, EXCEPT WE'RE GONNA DO IT WITHOUT THE VODKA. HOW'S THAT?  SOUNDS PRETTY ROMANTIC. WHAT'S NEXT? I NEED ONE GRAPEFRUIT. ONE GRAPEFRUIT.  LOOK AT THESE COLORS. I KNOW. ISN'T IT FABULOUS?  IT'S GREAT. THAT'S 1/2 A CUP OF ORANGE JUICE. I NEED 1/2 A CUP OF GRAPEFRUIT JUICE...  HERE'S YOUR GRAPEFRUIT. AND THEN I NEED TWO LEMONS JUICED. IT'S A BIG GRAPEFRUIT. IT'S BIGGER THAN THE JUICER. OKAY, I NEED 1/4 OF A CUP OF LEMON JUICE.  OKAY. AND I NEED TWO LIMES, TOO.  TWO LIMES, OKAY. SO IT'S 1/2 CUP OF ORANGE JUICE,  1/2 A CUP OF GRAPEFRUIT JUICE, 1/4 OF A CUP OF LIME JUICE,  1/4 CUP OF LEMON JUICE. EVEN I  CAN REMEMBER THAT. OKAY. OKAY, THAT'S GOOD  FOR THE LEMON.  OKAY. AND NOW I NEED LIME JUICE.  THERE ARE YOUR LIMES. PERFECT. I REALLY DO THINK COCKTAILS  SORT OF LIKE GET A PARTY GOING, DON'T YOU? AND EVEN IF YOU CAN'T DRINK  VODKA AT BREAKFAST, A MARTINI GLASS'LL DO IT. GOT QUITE A LITTLE PILE  UP HERE. OKAY, SO THAT'S  THE COCKTAIL. AND NOW WE JUST-- I THINK IT'D BE FUN TO SUGAR THE GLASSES. I'LL SHOW YOU. I'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE. LITTLE BIT OF JUICE, LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR.  IS THAT... JUST REGULAR SUGAR.  REGULAR SUGAR? JUST REGULAR SUGAR.  MARTINI GLASS. ESSENTIAL. ESSENTIAL MARTINI GLASS. AND THEN DIP IT  IN THE SUGAR. AND THAT'S A SUGARED GLASS.  THAT LOOKS GREAT. HOW'S THAT? WANT TO DO ONE? YEAH, I DO  WANT TO DO ONE. AM I GONNA TRUST YOU WITH A MARTINI GLASS?  WE'RE GONNA TRY. LET'S SEE  IF I CAN MASTER THIS. OKAY. I'M GONNA FILL A COCKTAIL SHAKER WITH ICE... WOW, I LOVE  THE COCKTAIL SHAKER. LIKE 3/4 FULL.  MM-HMM. POUR THE JUICE IN. SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED. PUT ON THE TOP. OKAY, THIS NEEDS  TO BE SHAKEN FOR LIKE 30 SECONDS.  I THINK I CAN HANDLE THAT. YOU'RE ON WHILE I GET  THE BISCUITS OUT OF THE OVEN. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO  THE BARTENDER THING. THOSE ARE LOOKING GOOD. AREN'T THEY GREAT?  MMM, THEY SMELL GREAT. OKAY. 30 SECONDS? YOU THINK THAT'S IT?  30 SEC-- I THINK YOU DID GOOD. HOW ABOUT ONE FOR YOU? OOH. ONE FOR ME. OH, THESE ARE GONNA BE  REALLY GOOD.  WOW. A LITTLE MINT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? A LITTLE MINT IN ONE. I'D SAY WE HAVE JUICE OF A FEW FLOWERS.  IGNITION. CHEERS. AND AFTERWARDS WE'RE GONNA MAKE SCRAMBLED EGGS. I BET YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE  SCRAMBLED EGGS, THOUGH. NOT AS WELL AS YOU DO. I'LL SHOW YOU. OKAY, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW  HOW TO MAKE SCRAMBLED EGGS. I DO? EVEN YOU. SO I'M GONNA CRACK THE EGGS. DO YOU WANNA CHOP SOME HERBS?  SURE. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO? YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU? WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME  HOW YOU LIKE THEM DONE? OKAY, SO THESE ARE SCALLIONS. WHAT I DO IS RUN MY KNIFE  DOWN THE MIDDLE OF IT. AND THEN JUST--I LIKE  THE GREEN AND THE WHITE PARTS. OHH, I ALWAYS USE  THE WHITE PARTS. I KNOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE DO, BUT I THINK THE GREEN  HAS LOTS OF FLAVOR. IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE DELICATE. I NEED ABOUT 2 TABLESPOONS.  DO YOU WANNA KEEP GOING?  YEAH. PROBABLY THAT ONE WOULD  BE GREAT, WHILE I CRACK EGGS. SO I NEED TEN EGGS. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT  DILL AND PARSLEY IN.  MM-HMM. GREAT. OKAY, ONE MORE EGG.  IT'S GREAT FOR BREAKFAST 'CAUSE IT'S SO EASY  TO MAKE. OKAY, SO I NEED  6 TABLESPOONS OF HALF-AND-HALF. YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS  I LEARNED ABOUT MAKING SCRAMBLED EGGS  IS SOMETIMES IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH LIQUID IN, YOU KNOW HOW THEY GET KIND OF RUNNY? YOU EVER SEEN THAT?  I'VE SEEN THEM RUNNY.  I'VE SEEN THEM MADE WITH WATER, WITH WHOLE MILK,  EVERY WHICH WAY, BUT I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER SEEN  THEM MADE WITH HALF-AND-HALF. IT'S A LITTLE RICHER. A LITTLE RICHER. ALWAYS BETTER, RIGHT? OKAY, THIS IS THE BASE. A TEASPOON OF SALT, 1/2 A TEASPOON OF PEPPER. ARE YOU A GOOD WHISKER?  I CAN SCRAMBLE. OH, YOU CAN SCRAMBLE ANYBODY? YOU'RE IN CHARGE  OF WHISKING. I'LL PUT THE HERBS IN.  HOW'S THAT? SO 2 TABLESPOONS  OF SCALLIONS, 2 TABLESPOONS OF DILL-- CAN YOU OVERBEAT THESE? NOPE. CAN'T OVERBEAT THEM. AND I JUST LIKE A ROUGH CHOP. I LOVE THE SMELL OF DILL.  IS THAT-- KEEP GOING. KEEP WHISKING.  OKAY. KEEP SCRAMBLING. AND 2 TABLESPOONS OF PARSLEY. I'M MAKING A MESS HERE.  IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE A MESS,  YOU HAVEN'T COOKED. THAT'S LIKE IF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T SHOW UP, YOU HAVEN'T HAD A BARBEQUE. OKAY, 2 TABLESPOONS  OF PARSLEY. PARSLEY, OKAY. OKAY, NOW I NEED 2 TABLESPOONS  OF BUTTER IN THE SAUTé PAN. HOW ABOUT  IF I DO THE SAUTéING? THERE YOU GO.  PERFECT. DID I EVER TELL YOU  ABOUT THE TIME THAT I MADE  A BREAKFAST PARTY, AND I MADE AN OMELET  FOR EVERYBODY? IT WAS LIKE 20 PEOPLE. I SPENT THE ENTIRE TIME  MAKING OMELETS. NOT A GOOD IDEA. HOW EASY IS THAT? NOT. HOW HARD IS THAT?  THAT WAS A REALLY BAD IDEA. WELL, AS SOON  AS THIS BUTTER MELTS, ADD THE SCRAMBLED EGGS. YOU KNOW, THE KEY  TO SCRAMBLED EGGS IS ACTUALLY DOING IT  VERY SLOWLY. OKAY, BUTTER'S MELTED. SO THE SCRAMBLED EGGS  JUST GO RIGHT IN. SO I'M JUST GONNA COOK IT AT SORT OF MEDIUM-LOW  TEMPERATURE. YOU MEAN ALL THESE YEARS  I'VE HAD THE FLAME UP, IT WASN'T SO SMART?  NO. IT ACTUALLY MAKES  THE EGGS REALLY TOUGH. PROTEIN, WHEN IT COOKS  AT A HIGH TEMPERATURE, GETS REALLY TOUGH,  SO YOU WANNA COOK IT AT A REALLY LOW TEMPERATURE. SO I'M JUST SLOWLY SCRAPING  THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN. SCRAMBLED EGGS ARE PERFECT  FOR BREAKFAST BECAUSE IT JUST TAKES  A FEW MINUTES TO MAKE AND THEN YOU CAN SERVE A HUGE  BIG BOWL OF SCRAMBLED EGGS, AND EVERYBODY  HAS A GOOD TIME. SO I FIGURE  LIKE TWO EGGS PER PERSON, MAYBE AN EXTRA TWO  FOR THE PAN. SOMETIMES YOU CAN ACTUALLY  JUST USE A SPATULA AND JUST SORT OF FOLD IT OVER  AS IT COOKS. WHAT KIND OF EGGS  DO YOU LIKE TO MAKE? ACTUALLY, I LIKE SCRAMBLED EGGS THE BEST.  OH, YOU DO? ABSOLUTELY.  I KNEW THAT. I DO, AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT. STEPHEN'S THE PERFECT GUEST. HE ALWAYS LIKES WHATEVER I MAKE. I LIKE TO LEARN TO MAKE WHATEVER YOU MAKE, ACTUALLY. OH, YOU DO?  YOU ACTUALLY DO, DON'T YOU? I DO. OKAY, BRING ME THE BOWL. THE BOWL. OOH, THE BOWL. AND I WOULD SAY  BREAKFAST IS READY. SO THAT WAS PRETTY EASY,  WASN'T IT? I THINK  I COULD DO IT MYSELF. I KNOW YOU COULD DO IT YOURSELF. HOW ABOUT NEXT WEEKEND? YEAH? IS MY INVITATION  IN THE MAIL? I'M NOT TOO BUSY  FOR YOU. THAT'S WONDERFUL. THANK YOU. NEXT WEEKEND. THAT'LL BE REALLY FUN. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA  EAT FIRST?  I THINK WE SHOULD DRINK FIRST. OH, YEAH, THAT WORKS FOR ME.  CHEERS.
