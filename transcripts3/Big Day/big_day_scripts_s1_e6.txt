 Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait. My... my contact lenses. - I drank your contacts? - I am legally blind without my glasses! You know you can still back out of it, right? - What? - It's just... It's so good to... I thought, maybe, you would like a chance at tasting your daughter's wedding cake. I will kill whoever ate this cake! Lorna! I really appreciate you stopping by for a tune-up session, Jean-Pierre. I don't really feel like Danny and I have quite nailed

 our spotlight dance yet. Honey, believe me, this is my pleasure, okay? The whole reason I do what I do is so that I can spend time with sweet young couples like yourselves. Of course, this time is not really covered under the package you paid for. Right. I got your e-mail about that. Hey, I've been thinking, um dancing is so fun, but do we really need to rehearse? I mean, maybe we should save some of the magic for the actual wedding. Nice try, Danny, but we need to practice. Okay, let's get my Fred and Ginger to line up, and we will review your dance. All right. Ready?

 And... begin. Sorry. Three. Four... - Me again. - Yeah, I know. Seven. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Okay, remember, you're young. You're in love. You're... You're terrible. Stop dancing. Seriously, stop. Stop dancing. Let's regroup. How firm are you on this wedding date? What kind of sick animal would destroy a wedding cake? You can't account for the the dark soul of man. - Do we have any milk? - Lorna! I'm sorry, did you need me? It's a disaster. Just what are you going to do about this, Lorna? Okay. I'm thinking. Hey, here's a fun idea. Ready? We custom-cut 150 individual cupcakes. Yay! Cupcakes? You want the cake fixed? Give me half a loaf of Wonder Bread, a tub of Cool Whip - and stay out of my way. - That is ridiculous! Becca. Remember Alice's seventh birthday? Who can forget when you hot-glued all of her Barbies into that sick doll orgy. No, no, no. No, Alice's seventh was when Becca tried to sell her to the people who sealed our driveway. You're both wrong. I told her, her cake smelled funny. When she went to smell it, I smooshed her face in it and said, "See, funny." I don't remember a smooshed cake. Exactly. You want me to fix the cake or not? Becca... No offense, but maybe, you should just leave it to the professionals. - She's so cute. - Yeah. So, there won't actually be a cake cutting ceremony, but we could hide one and have a cupcake hunt. Get the Cool Whip. That's fine, Francis. We'll just let them play out their little charade. But you and I both know that they will come back for those cupcakes, and when they do well we will help them make the cupcakes. Hello! You must be the dance instructor. Mom, this is Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre. Enchante. What? Good lord. I'm not French. My real name is Eugene. I bought the business from this guy, didn't want to have to repaint the van, you know, Pardon me, la van. So is there anything else I can help with while I'm here? The father-daughter dance? Or the mother-son? Totally worth the extra 50 bucks. Or $45. I'll give it to you for $30. Thanks, but I won't be dancing with my mother. She hasn't really been in the picture since I was a kid. I am sorry to hear that. You know, Danny, I would be honored if you would allow me to stand in for your mother and dance with you tonight. No! I, I, I, I don't want to... Mom, that is such a sweet gesture. - Very sweet gesture. - Yes. It's... - Then it's settled. - Great. Now, I get to dance twice. Terrific So what did we land on? Fifty bucks? I'm bored. I'll give you guys 10 bucks to wrestle each other. You didn't pay us for the last time. Well, you didn't pin him. If you're so bored, why don't you work on your best man toast? Freddy, I don't like to get bogged down in all that preparation, okay? I kind of, like, just feel out the crowd and then just wing it. You didn't write a speech? My God. Poor Danny. Do you know what an honor it is to have been chosen to lead the celebration of Danny's union with... - Alice. - I know her name! Dad? - Hey, Becca. - Were you crying? Me? No. No! I just keep thinking about when Alice was a little girl... When I taught her how to ride a bike... I taught her how to whistle. First time she ever lost a too... Too... My God, what is it about Alice that turns you into such a girl? You don't have to be so resentful, Becca. I care just as much about you. Name one time you ever cried over me. - What? Don't be ridiculous. - One time. Come on. One time you ever cried over me in my entire life. The first time I bailed you out of jail. Nice. So, that's what we agreed on, right? To the penny. So, then, the gratuity will be in cash? Look at that! But how? Wow! I didn't teach him that. I'm no expert, but I'm starting to think he's not the problem. God! That was exhilarating! Now, listen, Danny, don't be afraid to really just pull me in. - I won't break. Okay? - Yeah? Yeah, good. You stinker! Why didn't you tell me what a fabulous dancer this one is? - I'll see you later. - Definitely. Well, I've got a lunch meeting. How did you dance with my mom like that? I don't know! I just put my hand on your mom's hip and amazing things started happening. Not a phrase a girl really wants to hear on her wedding day. How come amazing things didn't happen with me? I don't know. Um... It just didn't feel like it did with your mom. You really didn't want to hear that either? Yeah. Jean-Pierre? Just, um, I was, I was just making a to-go bag. You know, because it's customary to feed the dance instructor. A lot of people don't know that. Listen, let me ask you something here, um... Um, why was I so horrible with Alice but so, you know, great with her mom? Some people just have chemistry. Chemistry? Yeah. You know what that means, don't you? You think it means I'm attracted to Jane. Why not, man? She's got that that sexy Mrs. Robinson thing going on, with just a, a hint of headmistress. Yeah! Put a ruler in her hand and send me to detention. Skobo! She's gonna be my mother-in-law. Well, she's not gonna be my mother-in-law. I'm telling you, man, she is hot. When I was dating Alice, I can't say I never thought about it. Can we change the subject, please? You're gonna be dancing with her tonight. I mean, you're really gonna be dancing. She's got those long legs, that... tight little butt. Johnny knows what I'm talking about. Hot lights... The energy of the crowd. All right, your body is grinding up against hers. I am not sexually attracted to Alice's mom. I'm not. What if she wasn't Alice's mom? But she is. So you admit you would tap that? Finally, some honesty. You know, I don't know if it's me or Danny, but something is just not right. You don't know how long I've been waiting - to hear you say that. - What? Please, go on. Okay, remember at my sorority formal? We danced pretty good together, didn't we? We sure did. I was a good dancer, right? The best I've ever had. Dance with me, Johnny. Look at us. We're great together! So you finally see what I've known all along. Do you wanna tell Danny, or should I? I will. I can't wait to tell him I'm not a sucky dancer. So should I wait for you here? Hey, partner. Come on up here. Um... Yeah, okay. I don't know if I ever told you this, but I was in the St. Louis production of Hair. Can you imagine me running around naked in front of all those people? No! I mean, I don't... I don't think of you like that. It was a blast. Here, would you mind holding my foot? Yeah. So, where did you learn to dance like that? I don't... I don't know, um... I mean, my dad taught me. That is so cute. So what do you say, Danny? Are you up for it? Up... up for what? Let's bring the house down. It'll be like opening night, St. Louis... The lights dimmed, the prime ribs were cleared, and 78 people were treated to a night they would never forget. Yeah, Look, about that, um... I guess... You haven't heard that, Alice, Alice and I, we decided there's, there's not gonna be any dances tonight. What? But... - I, I don't understand. - I don't either! I don't! But you know, I mean, there you go. What are you gonna do about it, anyway, you know? It's good talking to you, and I'll see you, I guess, later, bye. Here. Danny deserves a decent toast. You wrote my toast? Thanks, brother. I didn't do it for you, Skobo. I did it for Danny. Whatever. The point is, I don't have to do it. Read me what you got. "Danny... Friend." Here I am, watching you embark on the next season of your life. Strong, confident, wise beyond your years. And while I will always cherish what we've shared together, it's time to let you fly. But know I will always keep a perch for you here "to rest your weary wings." - What? - That? That's crap. Where are all the jokes about the time Danny got drunk and slept with a fat chick, or how big of a slut Alice is? That's not a toast! That's a love letter, man. Come on! Punch it up and get back to me. You told my mom there wasn't gonna be any dancing? You heard about that? Well, you know, you... you said you wanted me to take a more active role in planning our wedding. And so... There! I... I did. Why did you cancel the dancing? - I don't know. - Danny. - I don't know! - Danny! I think I might be inappropriately attracted to your mom! This... This isn't funny. Yes, it is. Okay, well, how else do you explain it? You know, 'cause we, we, we have chemistry. What? You saw us out there. We were sensational. That's why we're not having a first dance at our wedding? Because you're worried you're hot for my mom? Well, I'm glad that you're enjoying this. Danny. You got yourself all screwed up about this. We're just both under so much pressure. Forget about my mom. We're great dancers, and we are gonna kick so much ass on that dance floor tonight. Come on, let's try again. You'll see. Sorry. Danny! I thought you were gonna go to the left. Okay, stop. This is enough. - So the dancing? - There is no dancing! Hey, when did you start playing the bass? When I was 11. Neato. Anyway... Look what I have. - That's my oven. - Yeah, I found it while I was pretending to look for your mother's old dance shoes. I just wanted to show you that I cherish memories from your childhood, too. I used to love this thing. - I can't believe you remembered. - Of course, I remembered. Becca... you were my first born. Do you know how happy you make me? - Dad. - Aw. Hey, remember the fire? What? That's right. I forgot. You used your little oven to set fire to your mother's new drapes. That's why I took it away in the first place. What the hell was wrong with you? No, you cannot be mad at me all over again, okay? I was grounded for, like, months. I served my time. I just never understood you. It was like you were always looking for new ways to get into trouble. Like the time I got a call to come home from work early because you, you stuck candles in your sister's ear. Yeah, I remember. That was my sixth grade graduation party. Or what about the time I had to leave the seminar in Boston because you thought it would be funny to fake appendicitis? Yeah, well, apparently, seeing me perform a solo in the student assembly wasn't enough to get you home. - I was working. - You were always working. Look, Becca, I was in the first year of my residency. I was working 36-hour shifts. I didn't have any free time. I am not free time! God! Honey, that's, that's not what I meant! Come on! Let's... let's bake something! Hell, let's set something on fire! You should be the best man? Why should you be the best man? Because you are not a true friend. Okay? You are like that friend of Pinocchio's that took him to Pleasure Island. I don't want Danny turning into a donkey! You think I'm a bad influence on Danny? That's crazy! When you went to Mexico last summer, you lost him in a poker game! It is a game of chance, okay? He knew the risks. And besides, next semester, he sailed through Spanish. I can't believe he chose you over me. Well, he did, because Danny knows that I have nothing besides his friendship. That's why I'm the guy holding the rings. Johnny, you haven't by any chance seen the rings, have you? Alice, do you have a number for the band? Why? Because if there's not gonna be any dancing, it seems wasteful to have a band. There's still gonna be dancing. Just no... spotlight dances. I just assumed since you stripped me of my fun, you'd want to strip all the guests of their fun, too. Give me a break! You just wanna outshine me at my own wedding. I don't want to outshine you. If anything... I want to bask in your glow. - But... - Look at you. You are an intelligent, lovely, caring young woman. Is it so terrible for me to want to take a little bow for raising such a beautiful daughter? Mom. All I want is two minutes to shine. Of course. Sweetie. One second over, and I'm cutting the music. Understood. Hey, Danny. Come here. Does this look like a Becca "B" to you? No. It looks like an Alice "A" you tried to turn into a Becca "B." Damn it. There's gotta be something of Becca's in here. A macaroni frame, a hand turkey... Aw! Alice made me a finger puppet. Boop, boop, boop. Hey, listen. I'm sorry about canceling the spotlight dances tonight. I'm sure you were looking forward to dancing with Alice. Yeah, it's probably for the best. It'd just piss Becca off. - You're cool with it? - Relieved is more like it. It means I don't have to dance with Jane. - You ever dance with my wife? - No. Maybe. I don't remember. What? She's the worst. She just pushes you around the dance floor, like she's vacuuming a rug. - What do you mean? - She leads. She grabs on to you and takes total control. Just like she tries to do with everything else in my life. She leads. Hey! I know why we're terrible together. You sure you wanna tell me now, or save it for our vows? No, I'm, I'm serious. No, I figured out why I danced so well with your mom. It's because she leads. - What are you talking about? - Since I didn't have a mom, my dad had to teach me how to dance, and he would always take the man's part. And so I guess I never really figured out how to lead. - Really? - Yeah. So, um... I thought, maybe, we could... Well, or you could, try to, um, you know... - You want me to lead? - Yeah. - And you don't mind? - No! No, I mean, there's... there's plenty of other areas where I lead. Like... Well, one in particular. Yeah, but sometimes I lead there, too. Well, yes, but I like that. - We're talking about sex, right? - Right. No, I knew that, I knew that. May I come in? Listen, just because I was building a career, it's no excuse for neglecting you. You're way too important. And if you would at all consider it... I'd love to hear that recital I missed. Really? Okay. I mean, I only have my bass. And at the end of my second number, we'll bring the lights down for my song. Are you familiar with the musical Hair? I always wanted to see it. Um, but my father was born hairless, and that show touched a nerve. I found them! It's another curtain ring. Why are there so many curtain rings on the floor? - Don't you have to take that? - Nope. Couldn't it be some patient on the, like, brink of death? Nobody lives forever. Dad, you have to take that. Yeah. Hey, come with me to the hospital. It'll be the "take your daughter to work day" we never had. Really? Did you ever take Alice? Just that time you pushed her out of the tree house. Let's go.
