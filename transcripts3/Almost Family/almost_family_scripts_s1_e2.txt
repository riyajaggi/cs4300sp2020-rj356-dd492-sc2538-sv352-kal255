 Previously on Almost Family... Dr. Bechley, my source says that you used your own sperm to impregnate a patient at your practice. - I stacked the deck. - How many, Dad? I never kept a formal record. Do you wanna get a sister selfie? - Nope. - No way. - We're genetically connected. - Family. Finding a new family is kinda the best thing that's happened to me in years. I'm kind of in a fight with my roommates...

 who are also my parents. My whole life, it's all coming apart. I'm sorry you picked such a broken person to be married to. Here's our warrant to confiscate items related to the investigation. You need a defense attorney. I was hoping that you could represent the clinic. Maybe you need to ask yourself why you're still protecting him. In the house there's a laptop computer. I need you to destroy it. Bechley's misuse of his genetic material rises to the level of sexual assault,

 and we intend to prosecute it as such. Julia! Julia? - Come back here. Julia, I'm your sister. - Um... - Where are you going? Julia, wait. - Julia? Wait. Julia, come back. Julia. Where are you going? Wait! - We need to talk to you. - Stop. Julia, I'm your sister. Julia. Julia. Julia, wait! Julia! - What are you doing? Mountain climbers. They really burn out the core. Hey, do you wanna get in on this? We can alternate sets. Uh, no. I don't exercise my body that way. Maybe we should discuss how long you're planning to stay? Have you talked to your parents at all? Oh, you mean those losers who raised me? No, I'm not taking their calls. Focusing on my new family. Dad's getting out of the pokey today. What do you think? Flowers or balloons? It's an arraignment, not a baby shower. Hey. Whoa, I come in peace! Bearing gifts. Sorry, babe. I couldn't hear you. - You almost took my head off. To what do I owe this smoothie-liciousness? Just the amazing selfless husband that I am, and also I feel bad for putting so much pressure on you bedroom-wise. Couples go through things... dry spells... and I know you have enough on your mind right now. Yeah, yeah. There's a lot... a lot going on. Thanks, babe. I'm gonna get ready for work. Leon Bechley, you have been arrested on the charge of aggravated sexual abuse under New York penal law section 130.70, a class A felony, and schemed to defraud in the first degree under New York penal law section 190.65, a class E felony. Do you understand the charges against you? - Yes. - Yes. Well, thank you for getting me out of that hell hole. And, Tim, I forgive you for leaving Julia. That's not exactly the way that went. And, Edie, I know this revelation is a shock, but it is my hope that once the dust settles that you and I can actually... Leon, you're my client. I'm your lawyer. That's all. Step one was getting you out of jail. We have a meeting this afternoon with the judge to request your release from house arrest, and we focus on the trial. That's good. Very professional, Edie. I like it. We have a car outside waiting to take you straight back - to your apartment right past the press. - Uh, yeah. Uh, Jules. The only thing that got me through sitting in that jail cell was you knowing that you'd be out here waiting for me. I debated whether to even be here. But... but you're here, because you know this is a witch hunt. Sexual assault. I could never hurt women. I spent my entire career caring for them, and that's what you... you need to help... - Dad. People understand, that this isn't who I am, so what we need to do... what we need to do - is craft a statement. - Dad. Yeah, now I know you think that we should lay low for a little while. I'm not gonna lay low. I am gonna fight this ridiculous charge. Dad, I am trying to keep the clinic from going under. I'm trying to keep our staff from turning in their resignations. I'm trying to keep our remaining patients from abandoning us. I have God knows how many brothers and sisters including one shacked up in my guest room - that I didn't know about all because of you. - I understand you're upset - and you're tired. - No, don't talk to me like I'm a child. - I don't need a nap. Dad. - Let's just sleep on it, all right? - And we can talk about it tomo... - I turned in the laptop. You did what? I took it to the cops and I dropped it off. I don't want to craft a statement. I'm not gonna help you anymore. I'm done. Mm. We need to get going. - Car's waiting. I'm Roxy. Doyle. I'm one of your, uh... I kn... I know Julia's really upset. I'm... I'm just really stoked to meet you. Roxy. So kind of you to come. Thank you. Hey, listen. If you need anything, you can find me @TheRealRoxyD04 across all platforms. Julia. - Grace. Hi. - Hi. Thank God you're here. What is happening? Did your father really do those things? Um, let's sit. This is all gonna be okay. Your father is under investigation and the rumors are this place is getting shut down. - Mm-hmm. - Just, I'm... I've been trying to have a baby here for five years. I just finished my fourth round of IVF, and my husband and I have already been through so much - and so now with the... - Grace. Listen, I know that this is hard and weird and completely unfair, but we are going to be here for you. I am going to be here for you. I promise. I will not rest until your baby's picture is pinned up on that wall. Okay? Trust me. Yeah, yeah. Okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Julia, the meeting. People are waiting. The first time I came to the clinic, I was six years old selling Girl Scout cookies. At 14, I did my first summer job here. During college I interned here every summer and then I started working here right after I graduated. This is my home. This is home for all of us. And I also know that there's a lot of people out there right now who are scared and uncertain. People who feel like one E-mail from a testing company might tear their entire lives apart, but we have always taken care of people here, and that shouldn't stop now. Pema Chodron... a Buddhist teacher that I had to Google... once said, "The orchard is only as strong..." I can't take this anymore. Tell her, Isaac. Tell m... tell me what? Julia... We, uh, called this meeting for a very specific reason. Oh, okay. Uh, don't you want to know what the orchard is as strong as? What's going on? We have to make a change to your employment status. Okay. What kind of change? For God sakes, Julia. Haven't you ever been fired before? I just got done telling everyone that this is the only place that I've ever worked. You can't fire me. If we have any chance for survival, we can't have a Bechley here. I'm not my dad. You all know this. Isaac? Julia. Jan? I love you, Julia, but not as much as I love having health insurance. Julia. - Julia, wait! - What? What do you want? You need a second to gloat? You win. You got rid of me. Julia, nobody wanted to get rid... My dad did this, not me, okay? My entire life got turned upside down and the only thing that I had left was this stupid job. You should have stood up for me. People listen to you here. Julia, wait. The root system. What? That's what makes the orchard strong. The root system. Your Honor, my client has a prominent standing in the community. He's internationally recognized for his work. All reasons he's a potential flight risk. Financial resources, international contacts. He's not James Bond. He's a doctor with years of service to the community. He's also a criminal, and given the damage he did, the deception he practiced, that community is better off with him under house arrest in his nice, big apartment. Okay, I think I have enough to deliberate on, Counselors. Nice to know it's a crime to have a big apartment. I wouldn't know, counselor. - I'm on a government salary. That didn't stop you from buying this season's Chloe boots. - Can't live on bread alone. The Andersons are coming in for a check-up tomorrow. She's fine but the husband is a mess, so, um... he's obsessed with the Jets, which... I know... is sad. Watch the game tonight and then tomorrow when they come in maybe talk about it with him. - It'll calm him down. Got it. Debby Goldman is bringing in her baby for a visit on Wednesday. Make sure you get a good picture for the wall, and let her know that I'll be there for the Bris. And Grace Fields has been trying to have a baby with us for the past five years, and if this next round doesn't go well, she's going to be a wreck, so take good care of her. - Okay. - I can't believe this is happening. All right. I think that's it. I'm sorry, Julia. I know. Thanks, Jan. I thought I told you t... Yeah, I'd like one favor. No. Well, okay, I would do it myself, but you turned in my laptop to the police and now I am wearing an ankle bracelet that talks to a gentleman from the probation office. Your timing is horrific. Okay, I... I'd like you to bring me, uh, that drawing that you made for me. What drawing? Well, you know, the one that I keep on my desk. I think you made it in the third grade. It says, "World's Greatest Dad". I think you made the stethoscope out of, uh, spaghetti. It was macaroni and pipe cleaners. Right. Uh, okay. But, uh, Julia, here's the thing. Could you just... could you just please, uh, bring it to me? I mean, you know, they... They took everything else. It would... it would mean so much if I could just have that back. And you all recently found out that I am in fact a Bechley baby. Aww. And here I am in front of a wall of babies, a whole collage of potential mini me's. I have to go. Check it. Me and this little dude are total chin twins. Roxy, we told you this. You can't film in here. It's not film. It's digital. Okay, okay, listen. You have to stop doing that, okay? - I just told her that. Hi, Dr. Isaac. Listen, I don't know if you heard, but I'm actually part of the family now, so it'd be great if you could just back off. Take care of that, Julia. This is total crap! I mean, how can they do this to you? Your father is Leon Bechley. Right, the man whose response to ruining my life is asking me to bring him a drawing I made for him when I was eight years old. Aww, that's really sweet. No, it's not. It's... you don't know his game. First I'm bringing him the drawing. Next he'll have me picking up his hand-rolled tortellini en brodo from Trattoria Buca. Trattoria who? It's his favorite restaurant, which is terrible for his health. And he's probably not taking his meds. He just had a heart attack. Doctors are the worst patients. You wanna go see him, huh? No, I don't. I wanna kill him. But it was my job to worry about him for so long. You know, I have a little free time today. If you want I can go over there and check on him and make sure he's taking his meds and... and let you know. Fine. Fine, just go over there and make sure that he's taking his meds. - All of them. - Yeah. - And... and report back to me. - Okay. - And no lingering. - Yeah. No, listen. You won't regret this. - Can I borrow 50 bucks? Yeah, we're leaving, Mark. So at the hearing today... Mm-hmm? Is it me or was there, like, a vibe happening between you and Amanda Doherty? - I don't know what you mean. I don't know. It was like the way she made you laugh, it was like she caught you off guard, and I don't know. I just feel like I haven't been able to do that - for you in a while. So you were watching the two of us sparring? Two women and you got what? Jealous? I don't know. I... I just... Or did you get turned on? Both. Well, um, maybe I can help you out with that. Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting. Roxy, uh, it's... uh, it's you. A little birdie told me that this was your favorite restaurant. Bucca di Beppo. Oh. Hmm. Is this wrong? No, it's actually Trattoria Buca, not, uh, Boopa de... the... Oh, my God. I knew I would get it wrong. I get everything wrong. You're this fancy person. I mean, of course you're not gonna eat from a chain place. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Oh, no, no, no, no. It's great. It's okay. No, no, hang on. Come on in. You know, it smells, uh, great. Um, it's just, uh, you know, it's new to me, so I, uh, yeah. What are, uh, these? Um, garlic knots. Oh. Huh. That's delicious. Yeah. I was so nervous to meet you. Mm. This is, like, the biggest thing that's happened in my life, like, ever. No bigger than landing that vault at Athens. Two and a half twists? Hmm. Yeah, but I mean, I landed on my ass in the individuals. I had to settle for silver. You didn't settle. You were robbed. Come on. I think so, too. I mean, and the judging system is so rigged. I mean, don't even get me started on the Romanians. Yeah, not a huge fan of the system right now, either. Hey, listen, you're gonna beat this case, okay? And especially with Edie helping you, I mean, I thought I was intense. Pretty sure Edie sleeps upside down. - You're in good hands. Anyway, um, uh, you seem all right. Uh, I can't really stay. Well, you're not gonna join me? I mean, I can't eat this all by myself. And I wanna hear more about you and... here you are. And your... your road to Olympic glory. Well, I guess it would be a shame to let those knots get cold. Yeah. Don't eat all of them. Oh, ooh. Sorry. Hi, hello. Um, I forgot my bike lock at home. Sorry. Uh... uh, packages go downstairs through security. Oh, I'm... I'm not a bike messenger. I, um... I'm looking for Edie Palmer. And you are? A new client and a new sister. You still worried about Amanda? Who's Amanda? You have no idea how safe I feel in your arms. Edie? Julia? Hello. Should I put my jacket on? Can I come in? Great, thanks. Hey. Am I interrupting something? - No. - Yes. What's up, Julia? They fired me... the clinic, and I realize that I... I can't let them do that to me, you know? I... Are you guys okay? Were you working out or something? No. You were saying? Right. Um, I'm not gonna just walk away from the clinic because of my father's actions. Those patients, they... they need me, and I need them. I brought my employment agreement because I was hoping maybe you guys could look at it. I don't understand it. Maybe there's a loophole or something that, um... I'm sorry, is that underwear? What we do is our business or pleasure. It's both. We're married. I know. I'm not an employment lawyer, but I'd be happy to take a look at this contract. - I'm sure I could help. Thank you. That's very nice of you. Also, you staying away from the clinic is a good idea, for the case and for you. You don't have to be your dad's glorified secretary anymore. I'm the vice president of commun... you know what? It doesn't matter. Whatever, I... Okay. I'm gonna go. Listen, if I lose my job, I lose everything. So... How badly does the laptop hurt the case? It's their entire case, Julia. What did you think? I didn't think it was gonna be this bad. I mean, sexual assault? Leon put her in a terrible position. If she didn't turn it in, she would have become an accomplice. Well, the damage is done, so let the professionals clean it up. Your panties are literally in your pocket. We're married. I'm aware. I didn't keep a record of everyone, you know? Just the special patients. Exceptional people like you. I mean, I just wanted to see... marvel, really... at how amazing you became. Yeah. But again, I mean, it ends up looking like I'm some kind of creep. I mean, I... I see how it can look like that, you know, to the wrong people. I knew my material would work. It's why I used it and only until other technology made it unnecessary. But I stopped years ago, not that anyone would believe me. But, uh... I only wanted to help. You know, for that, I'm crucified. I believe you. Thank you. I wish everyone would. Well, not everyone, but... You mean Julia? I can talk to her. No, it's okay. She has every right to be angry. Anyway, sorry. Uh, it's your... it's your roll. What are we doing? - Okay. - Yeah. We're in discovery. Right now they have enough on him for criminal fraud and malpractice, but the sexual assault charge is a huge overreach, so we're gunning for dismissal. What do they have? It's mostly just based on his laptop, showing nefarious intent by tracking the children he produced. Well, don't underestimate a politically motivated prosecutor in this current climate, okay? She could drum up a lot of public outcry, get everyone calling for his head. I don't intend to let that happen. You have a relationship with Amanda Doherty? We're friendly. Take her out for a couple cosmos, see if you can suss out her bottom line. You might be able to make a deal with her. It's a really good idea. I'll handle it. No, I have a feeling Edie should do it. She might have more luck charming this particular gal. How's my dad? - Got in, got out? Yep. 'Cause it's pretty late. Well, maybe I had plans after. I don't think you did. All right, fine. I spent the whole time there. But it was awesome. I mean, he has my same weird pinkie toes. Do you know how cool it is to see that for the first time? Oh, and I learned how to play backgammon. - Did he take his meds? - Yeah, he said he did. So you didn't do the one thing that I asked you to do? He said that he took them, and I believe him. You know, he's really sad. He misses you a lot. He misses what I did for him. No, he misses you and how you look up to him and how you respect him. He was just trying to help people and now he's getting crucified. Crucified? Did he tell you to say that? I think of my own words to say. No, that is his word. I'm sorry but don't think that he just automatically likes you. He's... he's using you to get to me. Because it's so impossible to believe he might enjoy spending time with me? Why do I smell garlic? - I don't know. - I definitely smell garlic. All right, fine. I... I brought him garlic knots, and you know what? - He loved them. - That's not true. He hates garlic. He would never eat garlic knots. You just can't stand that you have a little competition for your dad's love for once. That's what's keeping you up at night. How do you know that I'm up at night? Because, Julia, I sleep right next to you and I can hear you tossing and turning all night. I'm having nightmares populated by who knows how many half siblings I have just running around in the world waiting to crash into my life. Maybe I would sleep a lot better if I had a pharmacy in my purse. You know, everything I take is prescribed by doctors. And doctors never do anything wrong? He was trying to help. And just think, if he didn't, - you wouldn't have me. - I don't want you! Here. I don't want you here. I want my life back. All right, well, you got it. Okay, I'll go pack my crap. Ow. Hands in the air! We're armed! - Roxy! - Wow, Diane. If I was a thief you were gonna attack me with a gymnastics trophy? Oh, don't judge your mother's choices, sweetheart. Wow, you guys have made that real hard. Your hand in that cookie jar as always. You and your sweet tooth. It's where I keep my extra cash. Or I used to, before somebody found it. That's my extra cash. Earned from my blood, sweat, and hamstring tears. - Where is it? - Hmm. No, not unless you come back. Yeah, come home, sweetie. We've been worried sick. I know what you're worried about, Ron. It's losing your steady income stream. Don't call me Ron. Don't call... call me... call me Dad, sweetie. I would but, you know, I've, um... I've met my actual dad now so, you know, what's the point? What are you talking about? You met him? - Yeah. - How could you? He's a... he's a charlatan. He's a predator. No, he's not. He is smart and he's generous and he doesn't take half of everything that I make. It's like I finally know what it feels like to have an actual dad. - Get out. - Ron. - No, get out. Get out! Get out of our house! Go on! Don't forget your drugs. And have a good time with your new dad! By the way, he's a felon! Hi. Hey. I, um... I got your message and it... it sounded urgent. - Are you okay? - You left the clinic. You said you'd be there and you weren't when I needed you most. I know. I'm... I'm so sorry. I... I, um... I'm a Bechley and my name is doing more harm than good right now, so... and, you know, who am I kidding? You know, I was just my dad's glorified secretary anyway. I need to talk to you because I'm pregnant. - Oh, my God! Really? Yes! - I'm pregnant! Oh, my God! - We did it! - No, you did it. No, when I got the news, Julia, the strangest thing happened. The first person I needed to tell wasn't my husband or my mom. It was you. From the moment we got to that clinic, you were this beacon, this shining light. You listened to us. You made my husband and me laugh, even at our most desperate moment. You cared. You never gave up on us. Your father might be some sort of genius but he's not the reason we chose Bechley. You are. You're the heart of that place. You're no secretary. Is everything all right? Yeah. I tried to talk to Julia but she's really mad at you, and now at me, so... Well, okay, but are you planning to... Oh, yeah, that'd be great. Thanks. Okay, hold on. Edie said that I'm not allowed to... Wow, did you collect all of these? Like, from around the world? Uh, no, they're mostly gifts from patients. Fertility idols. Uh, yeah, everyone thinks they're the first - to have the idea. People are idiots. Well, in my experience, anyway. You know, I... I planned to travel, you know, when I retired. So many places I wanna see. You know, but, uh, things didn't exactly work out, uh, that way so... oh, ah. - Ow. - Oh, your back? Yeah, yeah, all the time. Yeah, it's hyperextension in your lumbar. All those double twists before your spine is even fully formed. It never really goes away. - It just kind of sits there. - Yeah. All the time reminding me. Hey, do you wanna get out of here? Because I can take you on a ride. I have a sweet Porsche. I mean, you know, absolutely, but, you know, the state, uh, has, uh, other ideas. - Oh, I have a hack for that. Okay. But I think I should drive. I know it's premature to be talking about a deal, but my client is eager to get on with his life. You mean your father? Your client's your father. How you doing with that little nugget? We're genetically connected. That's all. Well, it still must be hard. A little. Sometimes I feel like I'm floating or something. - I don't... like, thrown. - Yeah, I do. I felt that way last week. You're a good kisser. Um, I had a lot to drink that night. I was upset about things that were happening and, uh, we should probably stick to business. If you take the assault charges off the table I... Nice try. I'm not reducing the charges. The evidence doesn't support it. Even if it did, the state gets convictions in less than 1% of sexual assault cases. My track record's much higher. Over 90%? 'Cause that's what you're up against. You've won 90% of your cases? 87. I rounded up. Are all your percentages that high? My percentages? Where do you fall on the lesbian spectrum? You're hard to read. The what? Am I the first woman you ever kissed? We should probably just stick to talking about the case. No, no. No judgment. When I came out, someone had to fill me in, too. A woman's sexuality is a continuum. 0% gay all the way up to 100%. Most of us are somewhere in between. Where are you? 80/20. That's pretty specific for something so unknowable. I've been at it for a while so for me it's knowable. What about you? 50/50. You know, I bet we can get that number up. - One second. I have to take this. This is Doherty. Sorry, it's loud in here. Whose ankle bracelet went off? Call me after you get to his apartment. Hopefully it was a malfunction. Edie, hi. Your father seems to have escaped. Escaped? I don't know what he's thinking, but this judge does not appreciate 50-year-old white men who think they're above the law. You need to figure out where he would go, find him, and bring him back to his apartment now. Yeah, he's not really my problem anymore. Oh, God. Damn it! Damn it. Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it! You know, we could have gone anywhere The bar, the casino, the homes of your enemies. But your old office is cool, too. Yeah, well there's, uh... there's something that I needed. Oh, Julia make that? - Mm-hmm. She's, uh, talented. She was always, uh, really good with, uh, - the mixed media. Well, that, uh, sure seems, uh, foolish now. I don't think awards are foolish. Feels really good up on the podium. It's the, uh, climb down that's the thing. It certainly is. Roxy, you're high. - No. - Yeah, you are. I'm... I'm a doctor. I can tell. What'd you take? Half a Vicie. Twice. Mmm. And how... how often do you partake? I don't really wanna get into this. No, no, no. It's... it's okay. Really. Um, pretty often. Pretty much every day. - Okay. - It's... it's not that it stops the pain but it stops me from thinking about it, so... I'd like to try to help you with that. If you want. Yeah, I want. Hmm. Hate to interrupt whatever this is, but you do realize that you're currently risking getting thrown back into jail? Julia, it's fine. Roxy had a... a hack. Then why did I just get a call from Edie saying the Department of Probation is on their way to your apartment right now? Oh, snap. We gotta jet. Come on. Your probation officer's going to be here any second, so you might wanna get the ankle bracelet back on now. Yeah, I... You put it on a vacuum robot, seriously? Yeah, registers movement. Yeah, got it. It's actually, uh, quite clever. Foot up, bracelet on now. - Not smart, guys. Damn it. Hurry. We'll be right there! You ate garlic knots? Incredibly delicious. Department of Probation; open up now. Oh, just give me the damn thing. We're gonna talk later, you and me. Evening. I got a report of a possible malfunction with Mr. Bechley's ankle bracelet. Excuse me, it's Dr. Bechley. And you can address me. I'm his attorney. All right, I need to know if he did anything to cause that malfunction. The only thing malfunctioning here, officer, is the criminal justice system. You shackle my client who, by the way, is still innocent in the eyes of the law and then you show up at his home at this late hour to what? Harass him? You can clearly see he's here. He's been here the whole time, so you can take this, because rest assured, I will be in the judge's chambers first thing tomorrow morning to have the terms of his bail modified. Good evening. - Very impressive. Are you sure? Because I had, like, three Scotches earlier. I barely got through that. How'd you think you were gonna get away with it? Oh, see, there's a little sensor on the bottom. Oh, we're not talking about the ankle bracelet anymore, are we? That's my bad. It's hard to explain. You go one day to the next thinking, uh, "Tomorrow I'll come clean." And then, uh, you know, the years pass and, uh, tomorrow somehow doesn't come. Well, it's tomorrow now, Dad. I've been on this case for three days now, and you guys are by far the worst family of any client I've ever experienced. No more turning in laptops or taking Dad on joyrides, please. Oh, and I read your employment agreement. You run the clinic now. Wait, what? There's a clause at the end referring to a succession plan should Leon become incapacitated. - You're in charge. - Wait. She's the boss? You're the boss. I'm the boss? Oh, Isaac is gonna hate this. I don't supposed that you want her. No, ma'am. I'll give you a month. That's it. - I love you. - No, you don't. Can you guys take this outside? - What do you mean? It's how I feel. It's not. It's not. How can you know how I feel, Julsey? So let's make sure that we've contacted any of the remaining patients by the end of day Monday. Okay? Oh, Julia. Hi, Jan. Hi. Hello, everyone. Isaac, hello. Uh, do you mind if I sit there? Julia, you do understand that part of being terminated is you don't show up to the staff meetings, right? I do, but I'm just gonna read this real quick. The bylaws of the Bechley Institute state, "In the event of the incapacitation or removal of Dr. Leon Bechley, all operational control is retained by Julia Bechley", which is, um... who is that again? - Oh, it's me. Isaac, you should probably give her the seat. I don't know what a medical facility expects to do with you in charge. You're not a doctor, but sure. Go. You're right. I'm not a doctor. Or a genius. I don't have that arrogance or that certainty that comes with thinking that I'm always right no matter what I do, but I do care about people. I always have. Probably too much and too often, and I know that there's a lot of people out there that need to be cared about right now. They need answers. They need support. Community. And we could be that place for them. Not just for potential Bechley babies, but for... for anyone who feels like their identity has been torn from them. You know, anyone like me. So, that's what we're going to do. This is our future. The new Bechley Institute starts today. Oh. - Nice speech. - Thank you. Any idea how to implement it? Not a clue. I'm gonna need your help. We'll do it together. We'll do it together. With me as the boss, but together. We're still in the process of identifying the defendant's innumerable offspring. At this point any stranger on the street could be a potential witness. Your Honor, the prosecution has no reason to believe that Dr. Bechley would engage in witness tampering. He's been fully compliant with the state... Despite a report from the probation office... That was deemed a mechanical malfunction. Dr. Bechley is looking forward to mounting a vigorous defense to clear his name. He's also recovering from a heart attack. Restricting him to his apartment is excessively punitive and unnecessary. And if I were to lift the house arrest, who will be responsible for him? I will, Your Honor. And you are? Uh, Roxy Doyle. I'm Dr. Bechley's daughter. Dr. Bechley, you owe your daughter a big thank-you. Your house arrest is lifted, effective immediately. I have to go to work. Jules. Hey. Hey. What? Why are you looking at me like that? I think that's the first time I liked being owned. In court. Well, I don't think I owned you. I think the judge just understood the logic of loosening the conditions and... No, keep going. You were saying something about loosening conditions. I may have underestimated myself. I have trouble believing you ever underestimate yourself. Not in court. On the, uh... in the, um... the spectrum thing. Um... Maybe I'm a 60/40. Well, I like the direction you're trending in. You okay to head home on your own? Yes, thanks. Uh, she kicked butt in there. You're a lucky man. Just stay out of trouble. You wanted to see me? I can't let this clinic that I built for 32 years be destroyed. Isaac, you have been my number two for a very long time. I need you. Julia's running things now, and you're not allowed to have anything to do with the clinic. It's too big of a risk for you and it's... I know, yeah. I have always believed that you were gonna be my true successor. Mmm. But we have our work cut out for us. Uh, take us to, uh, Trattoria Buca, please. Uh, Dr. Bechley, I don't... I don't think it's the best idea for us to be seen together in a restaurant. I... I wasn't inviting you to lunch. No, just... just for the ride. Holy... Julia. - Are you okay? - Tim! No, I've actually had a really tough day. Um, how are you? Uh, I'm okay, but I'm a little bit worried about you. Uh, no, I'm... I'm a rock. I can handle anything, you know, about me.
