THIS IS UNREAL. I LOVE HIM. VERY PROUD OF YOU YOU GOT ME FROM THE BEGINNING, WITH DIMPLES, AND FROM THE MOMENT YOU STARTED DANCING, I LOVE IT. THAT WAS A MASTER CLASS OF PRECISION. AMERICA HAS GOT SOME TALENT THAT WAS AMAZING I DIDN'T THINK YOU HAD PRECISION. I DON'T THINK YOU ROSE TO THE LEVEL. HE DOESN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT DANCE. WE REALLY WANT WANTO BE BACK I HAVE TO SAY I DID LOVE YOUR FIRST PERFORMANCE FIRST. I WAS VERY MOVED BY YOUR STORY AND WHEN YOU'RE UP ON STAGE, YOU'RE REALLY FREE TO BE YOURSELF. REALLY WANTED IT TO BE GOOD BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE YOU. BUT THIS WAS NOT MY MOST FAVORITE RENDITION THE JUDGES' RESPONSES WEREN'T EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE, BUT I AM VERY, VERY GRATEFUL LIKE, IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME TO BE ON THE SHOW. BAD SALSA! YOU'RE THE BEST THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD OH! YOU'RE SO BAD IT SHOULD BE BADASS SALSA. MY MIND IS BLOWN. I SAW A LITTLE STUMBLE I THINK AT THE END.

THE HIPS ARE TOO SHARP. * YOU KNOW MY CLOSING I THINK EMINEM IS DEFINITELY YOUR STRONGEST ONE * SHAKE IT ALL ABOUT I DON'T IF THEY WERE THAT SPOT ON. * POCKETS FULL OF POSIES STEPPED IT UP FROM THE AUDITION I SAW WHEN I WAS WATCHING AT HOME, SO GREAT JOB, MAN. IT ONLY SOUNDED LIKE SNOOP AND EMINEM THE ONES IN THE MIDDLE I COULDN'T RECOGNIZE. SNOOP WAS GOOD. THINK IT WAS 21 SAVAGE OR SOMETHING. YOU MAKE IT LOOK SO EASY BUT I KNOW YOU WORK SO HARD ON THIS. YOU ARE SO PRECIOUS AND ADORABLE YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN UP THERE A GIGANTIC WOLF HOUND YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP ME TRAIN MY WOLF HOUND? THANK YOU, BUT I...
