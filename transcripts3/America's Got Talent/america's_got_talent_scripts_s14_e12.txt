Own room into a movie theater. I would bring home movies from. The library. Black and white, silent films, Cartoons, everything. Then I would mimic the voices. And I got pretty good at it. I just knew that I was a. Performer, and that was it. - That's the way it was going to. - Be. But it's been a tough road for. Me. People thought I was crazy when I told them my dream. - But it's what I wanted to do. - Since I was a kid. So I'm not going to give it up. And now I'm about to appear on. The dolby stage, performing. Before millions of people. It's crazy I guess this is the overnight. - Sensation part they talk about, - Right? The overnight sensation that. Took 40 years. Did you miss me I guess not. They can take our lives but they. Cannot take our freedom. Donkey. We're going to have so much fun, We'll stay up telling manly. Stories and in the morning I'll. Make waffles.

Up with outdoing yourself, but. You did it thank you very much Simon. Your film before made. It more interesting because it. Showed what could happen. However, for me, the end missed. Something more dangerous, I.E. If you were to fall into a tank. Of piranhas, sharks, crocodiles, Something where we think if. You'll fall over, they'll die. I think if they had fallen. Over, they would have died they would have fallen on a. Piece of plastic. It needed something bigger at. The end. - All right, messoudi. - Brothers, good luck tonight, Guys. The guys are relying on you. Keep their dream alive your voices, your abilities. Thank you. I'm going to remember this.

All five branches of the. Military. They are voices of service there are men and women who. Have given their lives just to. See this great country prosper. We have free speech, we have. Freedom of the press. We have fought for that. Freemd. Freedom. It costs a lot for those. Freedoms. People focus a lot on the war, - But what we should focus on is. - The warrior. Every man and woman who pledges. To protect the stars and. Stripes, that's why we're called. Voices of service. We are the voice for those. People who cannot speak for. Themselves the american flag is the. Brightest beacon of freedom in. The world. As we sing, we want to. Encourage people to focus on the. Servicemen and women deployed. Overseas, their families and our. We won't stop until your mothers. We're on fire. We're on fire. Stand up, get up, welcome to the give it up for voices of. Service and the military chorus. - Howie? - My god. I can't sit down I just want to... I just want to. Salute you for your service. I want to salute you for your. Talents and for just... keep. Going.

Incredible performer you are. And I want to point out you are 12 years old. What in the heck. That voice is undeniable I am so proud that you were my. Golden buzzer. I love you thank you so much, I love you. Too. Simon. It's nerve-wracking to. Stand there. For you, young man, to come back. At your age with that confidence. And that poise and that control, And there were moments, I'm. Going to watch that back tonight. To make me realize how good you. Are, because that shouldn't come. From you at 12 years old. And you know who you are and. Where you want to go. And that to me is so important. - You've done yourself really. - Proud. Well done. Thank you so much Howie. People love this show. - They ask me why do you think it. - Does so well I think it's because we're. Watching people's dreams come. - True. - I think we just watched your. - Dream come true. - I predict you're going to be on. - A broadway stage, you'll be. - Starring. Thank you so much Gabrielle. The whole world. Just fell in love with you again. - And again and again. - Please vote. He is amazing, you guys. He is truly, truly amazing thank you so much, that means. So much to me. Luke, how has your. Life changed since you got your. Golden buzzer from julianne? So many new opportunities. Have opened to me. I am so grateful and thankful. I can't believe that I'm here. Right now. Thank you so much. You were awesome. Good luck tonight, luke. Remember, all of tonight's acts. Are depending on you. So you gotta vote! Voting is open now. Okay, backstage, one of the most. - Dangerous acts we've ever seen. - Is getting ready. Just look at that. A red-hot chain is never a good. - Thing. - One of the most dangerous acts. We've ever had is up next. At the auditions, Howie said this next act was the. Most dangerous he's ever seen. They stepped it up for. Judge cuts, and now they've. Gotta go one better again. Buckle up, people... and do not. Try anything you see here at. Home. Here's bir khalsa. Bir calkhalsa was formed by. - Friends who had been performing. - For years. One of us had to leave. They did not know they could go. On. But "America's got talent" is. - Too important. - So they found a replacement. Me. Since I'm new to the group, it. Creates a lot of challenges. I'm so nervous becausei have s. Much to learn for this. Performance. The tiniest twitch could result. In disaster. But we have been practicing. Nonstop, day and night, because. We are ready to show the most. Dangerous act in "America's got." "Talent" history. I hope that I'm ready. Bir khalsa. Whoa Simon. You want me to start. - Yes. - I have to say first of. All, with anyone at home with a. Chainsaw and a cucumber, don't. Try this at home. Second thing I would say is, We're always trying to give. People advice what to do on the. Back of this show. And I would say, if you could. Somehow... you know how they do. The knives on qvc and the home. Shopping network. This would sell those knives. It was fantastically crazy thank you Howie. This is everything I. Love about this show, it's. Dangerous, it's funny, it's. Crazy, it's relatable. When you started with the. Cucumber, I'm a dude, I have. Such memories. Howie. What a night Gabrielle. I did not think. You guys could find a way to up. The danger, up the wow factor. - And you absolutely knocked it. - Out of the park. Way to go. Thank you, thank you! Julianne. You crushed it out. Of the park. My gosh. I had chills. That was unbelievable. Bir khalsa. Do you guys ever get nervous no. Never. Never be nervous because we are. Focused and we have that. Precision through our practice. Good luck tonight, Bir khalsa. Every vote counts, so get busy. You can vote up to ten times for. Each act, with each voting. Method. All the voting methods are open. Now so go make it happen. Let's keep it going. Every so often, a performer. Comes along who totally changes. The game. This gentlemen made it. Straight through to the live. Shows thanks to gabrielle's. Golden buzzer. Gabrielle, why did you choose. This guy since he was born, we had to. Take him out in the sunlight. We took him to a specialist and. He said, your son is blind. It was scary to a first time. Mom. Then they said we think he may. Have autism. And I didn't know what to do. You see, the future for your. Kids, and I didn't see any of. That. The things that made kodi really. Happy was music. That's what happened, was the. Hope. It was something of his own that. Gave him joy. And I was like, now I know how. To help you as your mom. - I'm going to remember. - This moment for the rest of my. Life - thank you. He taught me anything is. Possible. Kodi finally gets to show the. Whole world who he is. He is our last contestant. Tonight, kodi lee, right after. This break. His audition has had. Over 425 million views online. Ladies and gentlemen, here is. Kodi lee. Over troubled wate. When darkness come. Over troubled wate. Kodi lee. - Gabrielle. - Kodi, you changed. The world and you keep changing. The world. Who you are and what you stand. For and what you continue to do. Makes the world so much more of. A better, beautiful place. - We have to stop putting limits. - On our children. - We have to keep believing in. - Each other. My god. And kodi, thank you. Thank you for letting me be a. Part of your journey thank you Simon. Kodi, you continually. Amazing. We are nothing without people. Like you and furthermore, we are. Nothing without our audience who. So generously shared your clip. - To other people around the world. - Who share your talent. And I also want to thank paul Simon who never really gives. Permission to anyone who sings.
