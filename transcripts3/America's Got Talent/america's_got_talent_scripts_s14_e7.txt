What are you here to do today? To sing. So what do you do outside of performing? I am a detention officer for the Tempe Police Department. So you are carrying heat... I is. Before you bring the heat. Yeah. [laughter] Being a detention officer, it's not easy. I mean, an inmate will call you every name in the book, and you have to just stand there with thick skin.

[cheers and applause] Thank you very much. Simon? I want to ask you a question, Olivia. You said you're 47 years old, right? I'm 47, yes. Okay. So what stopped you, at an earlier age, having a singing career? Did someone make you lose your confidence, or what? I went to school, and I got a degree in vocal performance and a degree in criminal justice. I decided to put my dream on hold to help take care of my dad, help my mom take care of my dad. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause] I'll tell you what I like about you. You have drama about you when you perform, and I love that. Thank you, Simon. Thank you.

Hell yes. Thank you. Howie. Oui, oui. Oui, merci. Merci. And it's a hell yeah from me. Whoo! Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you so much.

Whoa! Mr. Terry Crews. Hello. How are you? Hello. How are you? And your name is? Ra'ed. Ra'ed. All right. You look taller on TV. Yeah. I thought I was. ♪ ♪ My name is Ra'ed, and I'm a singer. I've always been eccentric. I'm the youngest of three boys in our family, and so one's a doctor, one's a finance businessman, and then there was me. I love being center of attention. Well, do you have a team that helps you with this? I have Marco, my lovely assistant. He makes all of this oh so possible. And you. [laughter] When I was nine years old, I saw the three tenors on TV, and I started mimicking them, and my mother heard me, and she said, "I think you might have talent," so I decided to take my singing to the next level. ♪ Are you scared of these boogie feet? ♪ I went to college for singing-- undergraduate, then masters, and I realized that not everybody can do what I can do. You know what would look amazing with this outfit? Gold confetti falling from the ceiling. ♪ Are you scared of these boogie feet? ♪ Give it to them, Ra'ed. Whoo! That's a big, beautiful [indistinct]. [cheers and applause] Whoo! Oh, yeah! [cheers and applause] That was an entrance. Did I underdress for the show? No. Not today. Trust me. I love him. So let's start with your name, please. My name is Ra'ed. There's an apostrophe in the middle of my name. Okay. It's Lebanese. It means "leader, lieutenant, general." It's my given name. I can't help it. And what is your job? Do you know those convertible buses on Hollywood Boulevard that take celebrity home tours for the tourists? Yep. Yes. I drive those buses, and I sing for my customers. And you normally get a good response from your passengers when you sing? They love me, and if you're watching, I'm on TV, guys! [laughter] [cheers and applause] Do you have any pets? My apartment doesn't allow me to have pets, but I love dogs. I want, like, three. [cheers and applause] I could feel your energy, which is why I asked, 'cause I felt that you would love animals. I had to guess. I feel your energy too, Simon. I love energy. Okay. We've connected. Good luck. Thank you. I'll be singing an original for you tonight. Oh. Hang on. Hang on. You wrote this song? Sorry? You wrote this song? I wrote this song, yes. What's it called? It's called "Celebration." Okay. What's it about? And--it's about--you know when an artist, they work so hard, and finally, they get a platform to be able to perform? This is a celebration. Oh, wow. All right. And we are celebrating you.

Wrong! They're wrong! We were rooting for you! [laughter] We were so rooting for you. I don't know what that was. Howie? Why are you asking me? I don't know what it was either. [laughter] You know how you hear a song, and then you get it stuck in your head, and you're singing it all day long? Not this one. [laughter] I actually disagree. Can I just say, that's actually gonna be stuck in my head. I don't know how you did that whistling thing. That was, like, the most high-pitched, literally dog call... It was a whistle. That I've ever heard. That was a whistle. Can you whistle that high? No, I can't whistle. He can whistle. So that is actually a talent, to whistle that high. Well, give him a golden buzzer, then. [cheers and applause] What are you saying, Julianne? I actually don't know. [laughter] I think you're amazing. Okay. Well, look. If it wasn't for the singing, I would like you. [laughter] Fair. Okay. We've got to vote. Howie, yes or no? For me, it's a no. I love your top, but it's a no. all: [indistinct]. Say no. No. No. No. No. It's a no from me today, but I love you. [cheers and applause] Three "no" s. I mean, [indistinct]. Look, Ra'ed, this doesn't happen when someone can't sing a note in tune. You get a standing ovation.

I had fun. I'm here to entertain, and honestly, enjoyed every second of it. I'll do it again with three--five-- four X's, five X's. . [cheers and applause] Okay. Here we go, guys. This is it. Last night of auditions, and you can say you were here for it. [cheers and applause] We've left our families, our day jobs. We have to prove that we can do this too. We can do it. all: Whoo! Revolution! Whoo! So are you having a good time, Julianne? I am. Yeah? I'm having a blast. Is it everything you thought it would be? I just--I knew I was gonna be inspired. This is the one job I've done where it has made more positive things to me than anything I've ever done. It's made you a better person. Genuinely. That's really cool. Yeah. That's awesome. How does it feel to be on "America's Got Talent"? Yes! Unreal. Just, literally, we're over the moon. [cheers and applause] Here we go. Another act coming out. [indistinct speech] [suspenseful music] [cheers and applause] Hello. Hi. You look excited. Hello. How are you? How are you? Fine. We're kind of emotional right now. Actually, so am I today. So who are you? We are Revolution Queens, the Queens of Malambo. [cheers and applause] So where are you all from? We're from Argentina. [cheers and applause] I'm guessing this is a dance act. We are going to be performing malambo. It's a form of rhythm that's very characteristic from Argentina, and it's all about strength, power, and you're going to enjoy it. So why did you decide this show to show us what you do? Back in Argentina, we don't have, like, this stage, this platform. We decided "America's Got Talent" was the perfect opportunity to improve our quality of life, you know? Yeah. [cheers and applause] Well, I don't want to ask any more questions. You have about three minutes, maybe, to change your lives. [cheers and applause] Let's do it. Yes. [laughs] Whoo! [cheers and applause] Oh, yeah. [cymbals clicking rhythmically] [rhythmic drumming] [troupe screams] Whoo! [Marilyn Manson's "The Beautiful People" playing] ♪ ♪ [cheers and applause] [whip cracks] Uh-oh.

Oh, my God. That's amazing. Wow. Wow. Wow. [cheers and applause] Can one of you tell us what you're feeling right now? Well, this is literally a dream come true. We've sacrificed so much to be here. Honestly, there is not a lot of opportunities back in Argentina for artists like us. [cheers and applause] You showed the power and strength that's within all of you. It's really beautiful. Thank you so much. I'm watching you guys literally dance for your lives... Yes. And that's what it felt like. It was so much energy and so much passion and so much pride, and it moved me to tears. It was beautiful to see. Thank you for your performance. [cheers and applause] Thank you. I--you know, I have seen this dance before, but what I have not seen before is women doing this. It was traditionally and exclusively performed just by men. That's one of the reasons why we're called Revolution Queens. We are revolution. [cheers and applause] To me-- I loved you before you started, but then I'm always nervous. "I hope this goes as good as I want it to." It went better. It was actually quite amazing. Don't ever doubt your talent, okay? Genuinely. [cheers and applause] But we're gonna vote. Thank you so much. Howie? I agree, so I'm gonna say yes. [cheers and applause] Gabrielle? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes! You got a yes from me. I think you just got about 7,000 yeses, actually, so congratulations.

Last days are always like this. We're gonna have all four judges... No, no, no. Say yes. No. Three "yes," one "no." My name is Mysterion. And I'm Steffi Kay, and we are the Sentimentalists. From a very young age, I've had a very special connection with my grandmother. She passed away about ten years before I was born. Even though I never met her, she's found ways to communicate with me. It makes me feel close to her. I always had this ability to know what people were gonna do before they do it, but it just creeped them right out. I spend a lot of time alone, but once Steffi and I met one another, I realized that there's somebody else like myself. When Mysterion and I work together, it magnifies our powers. It kind of feels like taking a test that I didn't study for, but I know all the answers. It is our dream to take our act and bring it to a stage that is international. "America's Got Talent" is one giant leap closer to our biggest dream. Take it all the way out there, guys. [cheers and applause] Hello. Hello, guys. Hi. Tell us your names, please. My name is Steffi Kay. Steffi. And my name's Mysterion. We are mentalists. We like to get into people's minds and essentially mess your heads up. Good. And what better a stage than to do it here. [cheers and applause] Well, we are here to hopefully see your lives change. You got it. Let's do it. [cheers and applause] Ladies and gentlemen, please draw an image of something simple enough that if you were to think of it, you could transfer it through the air and into Steffi's mind. The audience has done the same, and they're being collected right now. [cheers and applause] If you could pass down the judges' drawings, and you're gonna randomly take one of them out. Great. One, two, three. [clicks tongue] Her eyes are closed. Steffi, you have an image? Okay, so I'm sensing something-- I think the earth-- did--did you draw a tree? I see a tree there. That is in fact the image of a tree. [mysterious music] [cheers and applause] Which judge drew this? [cheers and applause] But you know what? I saw this, so we're gonna try it a little different. Up there on stage is a wind machine, and to randomize these, we're gonna drop them into the wind machine, but we're gonna ask for Terry to help us out. Come on out, a big round of applause. [cheers and applause] Where would you like--oh, here. All right, we've brought along a pair of safety goggles. Okay. You're gonna go ahead and put those on. I'm gonna dump these in here. All right. [cheers and applause] Hit it! Whoa! [paper rattling] [cheers and applause] When you've got one, let me know. You got one? Amazing. Come on out. Don't let anyone see what it is. In fact, I don't even want to know what it is. But you and I collectively are gonna put that image into her mind. Okay. And if, Terry, you would just pass me that, making sure it's facing you. You have an image? Mm-hmm. Okay. What is that an image of, Terry, if you could just say what that is? It's a heart. It's a 100% match. [cheers and applause] Wow! No! Whoa! That was incredible! [cheers and applause] I think a couple people drew this image, but the name of the person who drew this image: Chelsea. Who is this person who drew the heart? If you could put your hand up... If you could stand up. And say hello. Chelsea with the heart? Chelsea. Stand up. There she is. There she is. There. That's yours? [cheers and applause] There it is. That's real. [cheers and applause] I'll never know. I grabbed this at random. Okay. Gabrielle. I mean, I was wowed. When you hear the audience reaction, I think everybody was pretty wowed. Thank you. Thank you. There's something, like, really magical and mysterious about you, and I love the fact that it had to do with love, at the very end. Absolutely. Yeah. The presentation, for me, is a little weird. I don't know what it is, but it's the presentation that's more off than what you do. [audience booing] I'm afraid I'm with Howie on this. [audience booing] I'll tell you why. This is a great introduction to you, but if you want to be at the top, you have to have more imagination. Okay, right, we're gonna have to vote. Julianne, what do you think? Well, I'm gonna say yes. [cheers and applause] Gabrielle. Yes number two. [cheers and applause] Howie? For me, it's a no. [audience booing] Look, guys, I like you. I think what you did is good, but it's got to be great. Well, this is only the tip of the iceberg. Well, couldn't we have had the iceberg? I have an idea. If you would let me... You do whatever you want. You know what's gonna happen. Simon... Yes? There we go. [cheers and applause] Thank you. [cheers and applause] I would like you to think of any celebrity in the history of entertainment. I've got it. And I want you to print the name down on that piece of paper. You can use your pen. He doesn't trust the marker. I'll take a peek and look. Keep looking at her.

I'm not used to it. I hate to say 30, though. [laughs] What are you here for? I'm gonna sing. I've always loved music and performing for my family, but my parents wanted me to have, like, this everyday job so I could work like my brothers did. They didn't really listen to me. But I never wanted to join, like, the family business, so I just walked my own way, my own road. [buzzer] But it wasn't that easy, because I didn't get any gigs. So I had to work, like, the liquor store for years, but I felt like I had to pursue this dream. I've been playing small bars and stuff for ten years. My dad was like, "Keep on pushing, kid." And coming on this show, it means a lot to make my dad proud. I'm rooting for you, man. Go out there and give it your best, okay? [cheers and applause] This is, like, the first big step to my dream.

And who was your inspiration as an artist? You know, I began with a lot of rock music when I was younger... Yep. So I listened to a lot of Kiss. Yep. Mm-hmm.

[laughs] [bluesy guitar riff] I was born and raised in Winnsboro, Louisiana. My dad was a sharecropper, so I grew up on a farm. We didn't get to go to school, because we started picking cotton at an early age. Music was the only thing that I could get into that I wouldn't get in trouble about. Every chance I got, I played my music. When I was 19, the Vietnam War happened, and I joined the military. When the war came to the end, I started a family, and I had to make the money, so I got a job in my hometown, and here it is 50 years later. [laughs] Four years ago, I noticed I was gradually losing my sight. When I went to the VA to get my eyes checked, he said, "Well, you're blind in one eye and can't see out the other one." You know what I mean? Now I'm almost totally blind. [sniffles] But a bad thing--sometimes it brings out the best in you. I began to play the music again. It made me reach inside to find myself. It's like I'm 65, and I'm just coming alive, you know? I'm finally living my childhood dream. You ready? My daughter, I tell her she's my eyes. She's helping me being here. This is your moment. This is your time to shine, Dad. I love you. Yeah. You got this. Uh-huh. When an opportunity knocks on your door, it's never too late.

What got you into music? Well, to tell the truth, I was a carpenter all my life... Mm-hmm. And I lose my sight due to glaucoma, so music was always a passion of mine, so I'd say I had to lose my physical sight so that I could see my true destiny. Oh. [cheers and applause] Wow.
