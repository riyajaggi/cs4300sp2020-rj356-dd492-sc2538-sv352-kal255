 A Touch of Cloth (2012–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - The First Case: Part Two - full transcript 
 The remaining jurors are taken to a safe house whilst Cloth seeks out former chief inspector Bill Ball, who arrested Bradstock and admits that he was framed. However Bradstock's death and its timing eliminates him from at least one of the murders whilst the killer strikes again at the safe house. Only one witness survives to give Cloth the identity of the murderer, leading to a chase and a rooftop climax which also reveals who killed Cloth's wife before the case is closed.

 There's been another murder. Albert Stafford. God, no! Aiden Hawkchurch. High-flying chef to bed-bound human casserole. Some kind of sex game? Maybe later when I finish pointing at blood. Patron's a Gavina Duntish, female, 32. Come on, Clare, stop playing games! I need results, Cloth. What the French call "r-r-resultes".

 but someone's killing former jurors on the Bradstock case. I'll speak to the boys down the station, see what the boys down the station are saying. Yeah, good. Des, we need everything on Burton Bradstock. Case, files, trial reports. Sound, guv. And pull the names and addresses of every juror on that case. We need to get them into a safe house. Clare Hawkchurch too. Asap. Yes, guv. Asap, get me some kind of a sandwich. Cheese and pickle? Yeah. No, cast the net wider. Coronation chicken. Ciabatta, if you have to. Let's think on your feet. I'm on it, guv. Yeah, the boys down the station. So there's a link between our three victims. No, thanks. Three victims? That's right. Would you explain it like I'm some sort of viewer, guv? It's simple, Des.

 Albert Stafford served on the Bradstock jury. Someone's bumping them off. I say we're dealing with a serial killer. What we need is... proof. Starts with? Oldmun? Oldman. Albert Stafford. Served on a jury with Aiden and Clare Hawkchurch. And Gavina Duntish. Burton Bradstock case. What do we have on Bradstock? Er... Burton Bradstock. Jailed '96 for killing his wife. Released three weeks ago for not doing it since. Albert Stafford was murdered two weeks and six days ago. So Bradstock is our prime suspect. Where's that list of jurors? Boys down the station say it's not on the system. It's in the paperwork somewhere but there's a lot of it. I'm gonna call my laptop, tell it I won't be home tonight. Do a lot of late nights? Nothing much to rush home for. . I told you I'm working. Yes, it's important. Yeah, fine, whatever. Gemma? No, Gemma... Gemma? Short for Jeremy? No. Gemathon? No. Gemadict? No. It's Gemma as in... Gemma. So, you're gay? Bi, Jack. No, don't go. It's none of my business. I'm bisexual, Jack. I'm not ashamed. I just thought you'd be... I don't know. Shocked. Nothing shocks me. A female detective that swings both ways. An AC/DC DC. See? It's the sort of thing the boys down the station joke about. I'm not laughing. I haven't laughed since my wife died. Why did you laugh when your wife died? Oh, I didn't. I made a sound, I think, but it wasn't laughter. It was... something else. Like a bassoon? I lost my mind that night. I can see it. I can still see it. Jack? Jack! No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o...! Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack? I've found a list. A list of jurors. A list of jurors from the Bradstock trial. It's written in some kind of a... code. Upside-down writing. We learnt it at the academy. Here. All these people are in danger. Start dispatching officers. Wherever these people are, whatever they're doing these days, we round them up now. Yes? Andrew Preacherman? DC Qureshi. Can you come with me, please? What for? I'll explain on the way to the station. Guv? It's me. Des. Yeah, yeah. Jurors are in the safe house. Yeah, WPC Cutout's gonna be keeping an eye on them. Oh. And, guv, Natasha rang. She's run some tests. Turns out Albert Stafford was killed with a sword. Same murder weapon used on Aiden and Gavina. Yeah. Yeah, she did tell you earlier but that scene got cut. So, just to clarify, the key thing is all the victims were killed with the same weapon, which was a sword. Apparently, that's important. All victims, same weapon, sword. Just so you know. Good work, Des. Bye, love you. Well, they're out of harm's way for now. Bradstock's still out there just walking around like a man. We're gonna have to find him somehow. Public appeal? Not to me. Negative. So, if anyone has any information regarding Burton Bradstock's whereabouts, they can call our incident room in total confidence. OK, I'll take your questions now. Judith Chandler, The Independent. Do you have a personal message for Burton Bradstock himself? If I had one thing to say to him it's, "Stop killing people." OK, next? Robin Stork, Birdwatching Now. Were there any birds found at the scene? No. Woman with the hair? Jemima Symes, Rhyming Times. Were the victims gored with a type of sword? Well, that's one line of enquiry. Which you can... put in your diary. Right, well, I think that's enough for now. Dick Hasty, The Interrupter. Why are you trying to wrap up this press conference? That's really all I have to say. Mark Down, Market Trader. Do you want to buy this Dictaphone? No. Conor Tinuity, Lexington Inquisitor. Where are you going now? To see a retired former detective raking leaves in his garden. Is that enough for you? Will he have gloves on? Yes. What colour? Blue! Satisfied? Cloth? Detective Inspector Cloth, these days. They made you a DI? Wonders never cease. Good to see you, DCI Ball. Oh, call me Bill now, Jack. I didn't have you down as the gardening type. Oh, compared to the old days it's genteel. I like that. Still, I caution the odd starling now and again for old times' sake. Heh. But mainly I tend the plants. But I guess you haven't come here for gardening tips, have you, Jack? What do you remember about the Burton Bradstock case, Bill? That's a name I hoped I'd never hear again. You didn't see my appeal on the news, then? No. Or the one on Crimewatch? No. Or Paul O'Grady? No. Or Made In Chelsea? No. Or Total Wipeout? I don't have a television, Jack. Bradstock's out, Bill. We need to know where he is. Oh, forget about it, Jack. Some things are best left in the past. Like smallpox, and the Macarena. You ran the investigation, Bill. Anything that you can tell us might help. It was high profile. A young woman was killed in Coldblood. At the time, Coldblood was a quiet little village. Everyone was up in Arms. Arms was the town where they were based. We needed a result fast. Burton Bradstock was the fall guy. Lee Majors was The Fall Guy. Not this time. We embellished a few witness statements, lost some evidence. Mimicked the DNA sequence with a nucleotide fabricator. Burton Bradstock went down. Everyone was happy. Oh, Jesus, Bill! Don't judge me, Jack. It was 1996, for God's sake. Babylon Zoo were number one for five weeks. People needed hope. We gave it to them. By framing an innocent man? No wonder Bradstock's out for vengeance. You'd better watch out for yourself, Bill. Don't you worry about me, Jack. I always keep my eyes open. Bradstock's out for revenge. Killing jurors is just the start of it. Oldmun? Oldman. Yes, guv. You and Hairihan check the cheap hotels, the flophouses, the shit caves, anywhere he used to hang out. Use a montage if you have to. Just find 'im. . You seen this man? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! No! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! All right, girls? Have any of you seen this bloke? No. OK. Anne. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to say. I've tried so hard to make things work but I can't go on. You live for the job. It's like I don't exist. Even now as I'm saying this, you're not even listening, You're just standing there staring at a sheet of paper, thinking about the boys down the station. Did this note come from the boys down the station? I can't do this any more. Pick up suitcases? Carry on with this relationship. You'll have to do it alone from now on. I'll always love you, Oldman. Gemma, wait. Have you seen this man? Jack, where are you? Listen, we've got a lead on Bradstock. You'd better get over here. I'm on my way. Seems the appeal worked. Anonymous tip-off. A man in a distinctive red hoodie matching Bradstock's description was seen hanging around here over the last couple of days. Do it. Des, stop that. Put that torch on silent. Oh, sorry, guv. Guv? I think you might want to see this. Keep looking. Looks like some kind of... shrine. What sort of sick mind creates a shrine to Todd Carty? What are you doing in my lockup? This is your lockup? Yeah, I store chains. Art. My scrapbook here. I think there's been some kind of mistake. Boys down the station say someone matching Bradstock's description has just been spotted down the Eastridge Mall. Let's go. Des? Yeah, just coming. Oldman, anything? Nothing, guv. Asap? Negative. Dick? Got him, sir. Distinctive red hoodie heading north on the main entrance. Julie, he's coming to you. Pick him up. Got him, guv. Following. Distinctive red hoodie. He's heading down the escalator to the lower level. Not too close, Julie. Will do, guv. Todd, try to pick him up downstairs. Got him. Red hoodie coming down the escalator to the lower level. Des, have you got him? Des? All right, Todd, where is he? Heading towards the caff on the far side. I think he's on to us. OK, back off, back off. Pete, see if you can pick him up. Following, sir. Stick with him, Pete, but be discreet. Yeah, roger that, guv. He's going under the limbo pole, sir. What do you want me to do? Follow him. Follow him. OK. Damn it! All teams, go, go, go! Pick him up! That's enough, Todd! Enough! Todd! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Burton Bradstock, I arrest you on suspicion of... not being you. Damn it! This is where you got the hoodie? Yeah. Where, exactly? Bradstock. Heroin export. Looks like he drank himself to death. Qureshi, get this sealed off. Guv. Carty, call Natasha in Forensics. We need to establish a time of death. Yes, sir. Pete, go and inform the next of kin. Yes, sir. More sterling police work, Cloth? It seems the only way you can catch a suspect is when he stops running in favour of a nice lie-down and a rot. By the look of Bradstock, he didn't kill Gavina Duntish. She's been dead at least 48 hours. Well, then, I suggest you find out who did kill her before you're left completely in the dust. But... The dust, Cloth. Yes, Boss. I'm recommending him for suspension. I trust I can count on your support? He's a good man, sir. Like I said, I trust I can count on your support? Have a relative identify Bradstock's body. And don't breathe in for a moment. I've just been eating Scotch eggs. If it wasn't Bradstock, it was someone else. Let's go back through what we know, starting with the jury. Albert Stafford. We think he's been knifed. Turns out to be a sword. Aiden Hawkchurch was handcuffed and hacked apart with the same weapon. Ditto, Gavina Duntish. All of them swiped at, apparently at random, by someone wielding a sword. Who swipes at people randomly with a sword? George Alagiah? Lady Justice, sword in one hand, scales in the other. And a blindfold. Blindfold? Our killer's administering blind justice. Bullshit. Yeah, but it's more specific than that. Must have been planned for some time. That receipt in Gavina's mouth was two years old. So, he's trying to send us a message? Why don't they just text? Out of credit? The apostles. They're killing the apostles. Albert's middle name is Thomas. Aiden's is Matthew. Gavina is... Not an apostle. Not yet. It makes no sense. It's not the apostles. Anyway, that's been done. Wait. Hawkchurch's stomach contained laminated pear, right? Yeah. On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me... a partridge in a pear tree. Mm-hm. On the second day of Christmas, two turtle doves. Doves are the symbol of peace. Aiden Hawkchurch was found in pieces! Yeah, but how can they... Three French hens! What if Gavina Duntish went on a day trip to Calais? I say give it up. So, any other theories? Mega hits of the '80s? What about favourite Mr Men? Work it up. Jack. Yes? Jack. Jack. Kate! Jack. Kate. Jack. Kate. Jack? Kate, where are you? I'm in your mind. And this toilet. But you're dead. When you stand in the beyond, you see many things, Jack. To unlock the answer, you must heed the words of an old man. Which old man? Oh, you always take me so literally. I'd forgotten what a pain in the arse you can be. Just tell me... It's like that time we were at Jacqui's wedding and I said I wanted to strangle her brother-in-law and you got the arse with me. Which old man? Anne Oldman. Your partner. Aiden Hawkchurch, famous chef. So, he's got to be Mr Greedy, right? Albert Stafford, mithering old sod-box, by all accounts. So, he's Mr Grumpy. Or Uppity. Or Uppity. Or Bump. What's it got to do with Bump? He went in the night. OK. We'll go with Mr Bump. Bump's safe. We're keeping Bump. I'm sorry, Kate. What for? For failing you. I never found your killer. The answer is closer than you think, Jack. It's closer than you think. Oh, can you please do something about the bathroom cabinet? I will. You promised me for months. It's a mess. You can't fit anything in. I know. I promise. Good. Bye, love. That leaves Gavina Duntish as... Little Miss... Murdered. OK, I've got it! Aiden Hawkchurch was found in handcuffs, correct? OK, Anne, what did you say about the receipt in Gavina Duntish's mouth? Two years old. It was an old bill. Old bills. Handcuffs. The killer is talking directly to us, to the police. What about Albert Stafford? There's nothing police-related there. Not so. I took the amusing precaution of dissecting the cat. It had swallowed this, a police-issue whistle. Don't look so shocked. It's not the first time I've stood in this room clutching a dripping pussy, is it, Jack? So, the killer is taunting us over the Bradstock case? Mocking the boys down the station. Bumping off jurors, leaving whistles and cuffs at the scene. Oh, my god. What if they've got access to police records? Like Roxanne? Like the address of the safe house. Crosby, Stills and Nash. We'd better call an ambulance. We don't need an ambulance. We need a hearse. And an ambulance. Let's get an ambulance here! Preacherman's still alive, just. When he comes round, he might be able to tell us who did this. How's Cardboard Cutout doing? Still no pulse, still not breathing. Hairihan's talking to her family now. No. Jack? No. No! No! It's not your fault, Jack! No. It's not your fault! There was nothing that we could do. If we hadn't stopped at Nando's on the way here... Apart from that. An entire building full of innocent people dead because of me! For the fifth time this year! I can't live with that! Jack, no! No! No! No! Don't blame yourself, Jack! Blame whoever did this! Blame the five minute wait for my peri-peri halloumi. Or blame the rain, if you have to! Why the rain? Because it's cold and senseless, Jack! Like these murders! Because it lashes us mercilessly like this damn job! Because in Spain it falls mainly on the plain! And here it falls on all of us! Oh! Even you, Jack! Oh! Even you! Fuck the rain! Fuck the rain! Fuck the rain! Fuck the rain! Oh! Kate. Kate. Jack? I'm coming to be with you, Kate. Jack. I'm coming. - I'm coming. - Jack? I'm coming, Kate. Oh, Kate! I'm coming, Kate! Aah! I'm coming! What in God's tit are you playing at? You're coming apart at the seams, Cloth. Incompetence is one thing. Now there's so much blood on his hands, he's got scabs for fingernails. Cloth can wrap this up, sir. I know it. You don't know Jack, sir. I know he's receiving these dismissal papers tomorrow morning. You can't hang Cloth out to dry. I will see you in my office at 8am. And don't keep me waiting, Oldmun. Oldman. Don't keep me waiting, Oldman. Oh, piss. Dr Bernardi to the Almost Dead Jurors Ward. Dr Bernardi to the Almost Dead Jurors Ward. You're through to Cloth's hand. Jack, it's me. Where are you? I'm with the boys down the station. Jack, there's not a lot of time to wrap this up. Boss is on the warpath and the credits run in ten minutes. Let them roll. I'm here to see Andy Preacherman. You can't go in there. Yes, I can. I'm telling you it's impossible. And I'm telling you it's a murder enquiry. Mr Preacherman's through here. Thank you. How is he? He can't take much strain so go easy on him. Mr Preacherman. I want to ask you some questions, if that's OK? OK. Do you remember who did this to you? Yeah... yes. Who was it? For Christ's sake, be careful. Guh... God? Do you blame God? Gah... Geh... Gethin Jones. Find and kill Gethin Jones! Get... off... my... pipe. It was the policeman. What? The policeman put on a blindfold and got me with a sword. Which policeman? The one we laughed at in court when we were jurors. Years ago. I remember it like it was happening now. But in flashback. He was giving evidence. And the way he spoke, it was... We absolutely fell about! Just thinking about it, honestly! You... you probably had to be there. Who is he, the policeman? It w... wa... It... it w-w-w-w-weu-eurgh... What's wrong with him now? He's having an implausible relapse. Leave. Leave now or he'll die. Go now! Now! Go! Get out! Go! Now! Go! Go! Leave! Go! Get out! Go! Go away! Go! Get out! Go away! Go! To the corridor outside! It's not about taunting the cops. It's about a cop being taunted. All this time, it was one of the boys down the station. Who was on that case? It's got to be in the records. Guv? You might want to see this. Bookmark it. Keep looking. Eh? My God. Stop him! Der Weisse Engel! Der Weisse Engel! Der Weisse Engel! Got it. Bradstock, '96. Officer in charge of investigation... It's your old guv, guv. Bill Ball. Bill Ball? No, it can't be. No, wait. Ball didn't actually give evidence at the trial. The only officer that did was... Now it all makes sense. So, you want me to tell tales on him, Boss? Just keep me in the loop. Like I said, I trust I can count on your support. Would you write the address of the safe house on this envelope for me? Don't just stand there, Oldman. Help me lick the blood off this sword. Yes, what I'm doing, I'm murdering jurors that laughed at me. Yeah, here, let me write it on your hand. I just didn't put it together until now. So, here we are, Mr Preacherman. It would seem that arse Cloth has finally stumbled upon the link between 12 men and women good and true. Except it's true... that you weren't very good, were you? And I appear to have picked up my wife's gloves again. No matter. Well. So amusing, wasn't it, Mr Preacherman? So funny. Responding to the call, I quickly entered from the rear. Er... almost immediately, I came across a female lying face down on the sofa. Um... I then pulled out and decided not to re-enter without taking precautions. Um... as I did not want to contaminate the lady's front garden. Er... when the forensic officer arrived... I took her up the back passage... which had been recently evacuated. Er... she performed a physical exam... and remarked that, er... while it was not as stiff as she had anticipated, er... there was significant swelling around the head, which was purple and shiny and had only one eye... one eye which was leaking a milky white... Not funny. If you had seen it, big... shiny purple head, dribbling milky white fluid from its one dark hollow eye... Stop laughing, eh? Stop laughing at me, please! Stop! I had nightmares! Stop laughing at me! I'm a police officer! I'll kill you! I'll kill you all! Just a young officer trying to do his job. Well. I have one more job to do. Yes, one more job... before I retire. Time for sentencing, Mr Preacherman. Guilty! Oh! Oh. It's over, Tom. Give it up. Switching places with my intended victim so that I would murder you in his place? Huh. It's a clever move, Cloth. But I can still outsmart you by running away. Oh! Oh, my god! He's headed for Denouement Heights! . not so long ago we were just over there in Albert Stafford's flat, with his attractive granddaughter. Happier times, Jack. Why did you do it, Tom? That day in court... the laughter. The humiliation. Do you have any idea what that did to my confidence, my career? You made Assistant Chief Constable at 38. You were the fastest-promoted officer this force has ever had. Exactly. It drove me on. "I'll show them," I said to myself. I worked like a dog tied to a horse, day in, day out. Promotions, commendations. I hated myself for it but I just couldn't stop. Those bastards made my career. Well, it's over now. It's over for you. You're finished, Cloth. What the Finnish call... fee-neeshed. Shoot me, and I'll bleed in your face. Oh, always have to play the hero, don't you, Jack? Couldn't save your Kate, though, could you? What? Yes, that's right. It was me. I lured her to that eerie stock footage and prop warehouse. Hello? I lured her there on the night of the officers' ball. And I shot her. Tom? I shot her with a gun. A gun full of bullets, bullets that kill. Tom! And I killed her. Do you know what she said as the bullet went in? Ouch. Ouch. That's what she said. Kate's final word. Why did you do it? Why kill Kate? Isn't it obvious? You were shit-hot, Jack. You'd have been promoted above me. I knew I had to break you. So I killed her. No! I saw you at the funeral. You were crying. Did you feel nothing? Only my cheeks getting damp. But... Damp, Cloth! But while those crocodile tears fibbed down my face, I was laughing inside. Like this. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Dead wife? Ha-ha-ha. Bastard. No, Jack, don't! He wants you to rush him. He'll shoot you. That's what guns are for. And he's clearly got one. That's what's in his hand! So what? I've got nothing to live for. You have! Look at my life, Oldmun. Oldman. Oldman, look at my life. I'm a lot like you were! Idealistic. Committed. Sanctimonious. You can be all those things again. We make a lot of sacrifices in this job, don't we? Don't make another. Is this going to take much longer? I've got a man to shoot. Think of Kate. Think of me. Think of the boys down the station. Oh, stop going on about them! No, Jack! Oh! Jack? Jack, I'm here! Goodbye, Cloth. Goodbye, Oldmun. Oldman! Whatever. Jack. Oh! Oh, Jack! Uh. I wondered why I put that in there. Come on, Jack. Oh! Ow! He asked for a result. And we gave him one. Top work. Well done. Mm, yeah. Jack, where are you going? Home. Jack, wait. You live that way. Jack, wait! I've been fooled before, Oldmun. Oldman. I've been fooled before, Oldman. I won't be fooled a second time. I'm not trying to fool you, Jack. You've got a fiancee. Not any more. You're gay. Bi, Jack. Jack, wait. Fucking hell. Let me walk with you. Murdered by a killer. Arthur Killer. This is the work of Arthur Killer. Find Arthur Killer! I'm on it, guv. Guv. Admit it, Killer! It was me. Tell the truth! I did it! Liar! Tell the truth! You're facing the sack! But... The sack, Cloth!
